It is out of prakṛti (primordial matter) itself alone, as equipped with all potencies, that the various products evolve, really having their essence in that same matter.” 
It is out of prakṛti (primordial matter) itself alone, as equipped with all potencies, that the various products evolve, really having their essence in that same matter.” 
If the effect were non-existent, potentially, in the form of the cause,—then it could not be produced; because it would have no form at all, being like the sky-lotus.” 
How is it that people have recourse to only specific causes, in the shape of such diverse things as the paddy-seed and the like, and not any other,—even though the nonexistence (of the desired effect or product) is equal (everywhere)?” 
Everything likely to be produced would be produced from everything; because the negation of co-essentiality is equally present in everything.” 
Because the potencies of these things are restricted in their scope, therefore it is not as has been urged; hence it does not answer our argument. because potent causes produce only such effect as is amenable to their potency.” 
That to which no peculiarity can be attributed, which is eormless and unmodipiable,—how could such a thing be produced by causes,—when any modification would involve the loss of its very essence?” 
Thus the effect being impossible, what would that be by producing which anything would be a cause? as a consequence, it cannot be possible to admit the causal character of even such things as the seed and the like.” 
All that is Manifest is clearly known to be homogeneous with Pleasure and the rest, from the fact of the Effect being found to be the product of Satisfaction, Irritation and Dejection, etc.” 
Thus, the whole (manifest) must be taken as having emanated from something made up of the said (pleasure, etc,),—because the said generic character is found present in it,—just as in the case of the jar and other things; and this something is primordial matter”,—so say the followers of Kapila
In answer to this, the wise ones hectare that the argument that has been urged (by the sāṃkhya against the doctrine that the effect is non-existent prior to its production) is equally applicable to the doctrine of the existence of the effect. and the answer that you would have to that argument would equally aptly be the answer of the wise ones also
If the curd and other effects are already wholly existent in the essence of (their causes) milk and the rest,—then, inasmuch as they would be exactly like the cause, etc. in their essence, what of theirs would be there that would have to be produced? 
A) The said effect cannot be produced by the cause,—because it already exists,—like the cause and the spirit
B) Thus also what is postulated cannot be the cause,—because there is nothing that can be brought about by it,—just like the other thing
It might be urged that “there is some peculiar feature, something in the shape of manifestation and the like,—by producing which, causes might cease to be defamed (as futile)”
If this (peculiar feature) existed previously, then the objection is not answered; if, however, it did not exist previously, then, being- non-existent, how could it be produced out of the causes? 
For the same reason, if there is nothing to be produced, there would be no ‘recourse to the cause’,—nor would there be any production out of even a specific cause,—nor would there be any ‘efficiency’, nor any ‘operation’ (of the cause)
Inasmuch as every effect, is already there in its entirety, there can be nothing ‘to be produced’ (an effect); consequently, the very name ‘cause’ cannot be logical
All Means (of Cognition), when operative, serve to set aside Wrong Cognition and to produce Definitely Certain Cognition; this would not be compatible with reason (under the Sāṃkhya theory)
The doubt and the misconception cannot be set aside, as they would be always there. nor is the producing op definitely certain cognition possible, for the very same reason. hence all that has been said is futile
If, on the other hand, (it be held that) the definite cognition that would be produced would be one that has not been there,—then, this one instance (of the effect being non-existent) would invalidate all those reasons (that have been set forth by the sāṃkhya)
If it be held that—“the effect, which has been unmanifested (latent, in the cause), acquires manifestation through the causes”,—then (the question is) what is this manifestation of the effect?—it cannot consist in'the appearance (production) of a peculiarity in its nature; because of non-differentiation and non-connection
The ‘Manifestation’ of the Effect cannot consist in its Apprehension; nor in the removal of what was obstructing its Apprehension; because the Apprehension is a constant factor, and also because there is no possibility of a second (Apprehension)
Just as (under the sāṃkhya theory),—even though, on the ground of all things being constituted by the Three Attributes, there is no differentiation among them, and yet everything (Cause) does not produce everything (Effect),—in the same manner, even though the Effect is non-existent (before the Causal Operation), everything cannot produce everything
Inasmuch as the presence of limits would re impossible for you, the potencies cannot be restricted. on the view of their being existent, on the other hand, their restriction would be right and proper as pertaining to the limits.” 
It is not so; it may be that, on account of the absence of ‘limits’, there can be no such subsequent assertion as held by us. but there is no harm done to the nature of the thing itself which is entirely free from all restrictive adjuncts
The name of things is not their ‘essence’ (nature, form); because all kinds of ‘conception’ and ‘verbal expression’ proceed through habit, with reference to the undifferentiated (immaculate) entity
In reality, the ‘production’ (or a thing) consists in its becoming a thing; this ‘production’ cannot be related to what is existent, or with what is non-existent; it is related only to a conceptual idea which is purely nonexistent 
The basis (of the said conception) lies in the fact that the form of a thing perceived in immediate sequence to another thing did not exist before. if the said thing had existed previously, then this basis would not be there (for the said assumption)
It has been held that the curd and other effects subsist in the milk and other causes, in the form of latent potency; now what is this ‘potency’? if it is the same as the curd and other effects,—then this also would be perceived like the milk itself
If it is something different (from the effect), then the existence of one thing cannot be spoken of as that of another, except figuratively. (for example) the existence of the (attribute of) ‘harmony’ is not spoken of as the existence of ‘pain’ and ‘delusion 
The ‘manifest’ is not admitted by us in any way whatsoever as homogeneous with (made up of) pleasure and the rest; because pleasure and the rest are ‘internal’, ‘subjective’; and that these are so is manifest from their own clear cognition
On account of the diversity of habit and nature, all possible attachment and the rest are clearly found to be restricted to each single object, like sound and the rest
Being in keeping with one and the same object, the consciousness would be variegated in character.—if it be urged that “it is not so because of destiny and such other forces”,—then the consciousness would not be in keeping with the object at all
The form of the object itself is three-formed, and the cognitions (of men) are one-formed;—how can these latter be really possible with reference to the object,—being entirely different from it in character? 
For the followers of yoga, ‘satisfaction’, ‘dissatisfaction’ and ‘delusion’ are produced in the same spirit; and yet the other party do not hold the spirit to be of the essence of those
Even though the ‘manifest’ be accepted as ‘consisting of three attributes’,—primordial matter does not become established as the one eternal cause of that (manifest); because that ‘manifest’ is not imbued with any single generic character
All ‘manifested things’ are found to be like iron-bars; as having their forms associated with an order of sequence and their essence mixed up with fancies
So also the various products of clay and other things are not recognised as imbued with any single generic character,—nor as the effects of any single cause; as all such things as the ‘lump of clay’ are diverse
In the case of ‘spirits’, even though they are endowed with ‘sentience’ and other qualities, they are not regarded (by the sāṃkhya) as preceded (produced) by a single entity (as their cause).—it might be said that “the said qualities are attributed (to the spirits) only secondarily (indirectly, figuratively)”;—then why cannot the same be the case in regard to the matter under discussion also? 
Thus, even in the absence of a cause in the shape of ‘primordial matter’, all diversity relating to effects and causes and other things becomes explicable, on the basis of the diversity of potencies
Thus, even in the absence of a cause in the shape of ‘primordial matter’, all diversity relating to effects and causes and other things becomes explicable, on the basis of the diversity of potencies
Other philosophers declare the ‘lord’ to be the cause of all things produced; on the ground that no insentient thing, by itself, can produce its effects
Other philosophers declare the ‘lord’ to be the cause of all things produced; on the ground that no insentient thing, by itself, can produce its effects
A) that which is characterised by a peculiar arrangement of its own component parts is subject to a cause that is endowed with intelligence,—for instance, the jar and other objects.—the thing in dispute,—which is perceptible by means of two sense-organs and also imperceptible,—must be preceded (and produced) by a cause endowed with intelligence,—atoms supplying the corroborative instance ‘per dissimilarity’.” 
B) the material cause of the body and other things is controlled by an intelligent being,—because they are endowed with colour and other qualities,—like the yarn and such things which have been seen to bring about their effects (only when controlled by the intelligent weaver).” 
In the producing of their effects, all such causes as merit, demerit and atoms are controlled by an intelligent being,—because they operate intermittently,—like the shuttle and the yarn.” 
At the beginning of creation, usage among men must have been due to the teaching of other persons;—when they become subsequently awakened to consciousness, it is found to be restricted to particular things,—like the usage of little boys.” 
The manifested world, consisting of the primary elemental substances and the rest, becomes the source of pleasure and pain to all people, only when controlled by an intelligent cause,—because it is insentient, itself a product, evanescent and so forth,—like the axe and other things; thus everything is clearly believed to be his.” 
The fact of his being the creator of all things having been established, his omniscience is proved without effort; because the creator must be one who knows the form and all other details regarding what he has created.” 
The thing under dispute must clearly be perceptible to some one,—because or such reasons as being a thing, being existent and so forth:—just like the diversities of pleasure, pain, etc.—[and this some one is god].” 
The first argument (propounded by the naiyāyika) is open to the fallacy of being ‘unproven, inadmissible’; because the existence of any such ‘arrangement’ as ‘conjunction’ is not proven, nor that of the ‘composite 
Because both the facts that have been assumed (and put forward) are such as are not actually apprehended; and for the same reason the corroborative instance also that has been cited has no connection with the probans cited
Visual cognition and tactile cognition always appear differently; they cannot therefore have one and the same substratum,—just like the cognition of odour and other things
As a matter of fact, what brings about the joint cognition (involved in recognition) is the fact that recognition consists in an assumption arising out of the potencies of the two cognitions concerned.—thus, such things as water, fire and the like are not ‘perceptible by two sense-organs ’; and hence the probans (of the naiyāyika) is found to have its substratum ‘unproven, inadmissible’, as is indicated by the ‘ un-proven ’ character of the object itself
In the case of temples and such things, the presence of a peculiar arrangement (of component parts) is distinctly perceived,—from which perception follows the cognition (inferential) of an intelligent builder,—even when no such builder is actually seen; if, in the case of such objects as the body, the mountain and the like, a similar peculiar arrangement of parts were distinctly perceived, then it would be correct to deduce from this perception as the reason, the conclusion that is desired (by the Naiyāyika)
When a certain thing is definitely recognised, through affirmative and negative concomitance, as the effect of a certain cause, then, the perception of that effect must prove that cause;—such is the standing law.—the ‘peculiar arrangement of parts’ in such diverse things as the body, the mountain and the like however is not an effect of this kind; there is a mere assertion to that effect.—such a reason, when put forward, renders the conclusion open to doubt and denial, as it does when put forward for proving that ‘the anthill is the work of the potter 
What has been put forward (by you) is only a ‘futile rejoinder’, as it is based upon the assumption op a particular character; while what has been put forward (by us, the naiyāyika) is only the general character of ‘effects’.” 
In the example of futile rejoinder cited] the mere thing (effect in general), as excluded from all that is not that thing (not-effect), does really prove non-eternality, on account of its being of the same essence as that. but as regards the probans under discussion, there is no reason for it at all
As a matter of fact, the smoke that has been seen to be invariably concomitant with fire is white; and yet the mention of mere ‘whiteness’ could not prove the existence of fire; if it did, then that existence could be inferred even from the ‘snow’
When the invariable concomitance (premiss) is stated in the general form, and the objection urged against it is on the basis of a particular aspect of it,—then this is said to be a futile rejoinder
The mere character of ‘being denoted by the term go’ (as a general character) might prove the ‘presence of horns’ in the quarters and other things (which are all denoted by the term ‘go’),—ip the reasoning were not adopted in a different form
If it were proved by some valid means of cognition that there is an invariable concomitance between the probans and the probandum (cited by the naiyāyika), then, the conclusion would be fully established by reasoning, and no one could have anything to say against it
But the existence of a being who is eternal, one, and the substratum of eternal all-embracing consciousness,—can never be proved; as the invariable concomitance (premiss) that may be cited would be devoid of the probandum
For instance, all such products as houses, steps, gateways, towers and the like are definitely known to have been made by makers who have been many, and with fleeting ideas
For the same reason, the probans is also detrimental to what is desired; inasmuch as what it establishes is [a cause] that is many, and the substratum of fleeting ideas
The invariable concomitance that has been asserted by you is only with reference to the probandum in the form of ‘the character of having an intelligent cause’; and we are going to assert it clearly with reference to a second (different, contrary) probandum
For us, eternal things cannot produce any effects, because ‘consecutive’ and ‘concurrent’ action are mutually contradictory; and if objects are consecutive, there must be the same consecutiveness in their cognitions also
God’s cognition must be consecutive, because it is related to consecutive cognisable things;—just like the cognition of devadatta and other persons, relating to flame and other things
The jar and other things are regarded by us as mere aggregates of atoms; and the potter and other men who make those things are only makers of the atoms; hence the character that you mean to prove (i.e. your probandum) is not excluded (absent) erom the atom which has been cited (by you) as a corroborative instance per dissimilarity
If the character of ‘being produced by an intelligent cause’ is meant to be proved only in a general form, then we have no dispute with you; as all diversity is due to actions
If what you seek to prove is the fact that the world is created by a cause who is one and whose consciousness is eternal,—then there is absence of the probandum (in the instance); and it is ‘inconclusive’ also, since such things as the house and the like are found to be made by several makers
Against the other reasonings (of the theist) also, this same criticism may be urged mutatis mutandis; some other criticism also is now being briefly set forth
Intermittent action’ of atoms and other causes is not proven (admitted); as there is ‘perpetual flux’, all things are undergoing destruction every moment; it is also ‘inconclusive’ in reference to that same (god), as hls activity also is consecutive (hence intermittent)
According to us, at dissolution, persons do not continue to remain with all consciousness and memory completely lost; because they are born in effulgent regions, and from these latter they are born again in this world
Then again, the ‘teachership’ of a mouthless person can only be a matter of blind faith; god’s ‘mouthlessness’ is proved by his having no body, on account of the absence in him of merit and demerit
In all the arguments, the invariable concomitance (premiss) is contrary to inference; and there can be no invariable concomitance of the probans on the basis of a contrary (false) character
God cannot be the cause of born things,—because he is hlmsele devoid of birth,—like the ‘sky-lotus’, otherwise, all things would come into existence simultaneously
Things that are born consecutively cannot have cod for their cause,—just like the notions of foolish persons arising from the said reasonings (of the theist).—if those (notions) also are produced by cod, then the adducing of proofs (in support of them) should be useless; because of (his) eternality; and as he would be beyond remedy, the said statement could render no help
When you have seen that a certain thing exists only when certain other things exist, and never when these do not exist,—then, if you assume a cause for the former, other than these latter,—how can you avoid falling into an infinite regress? 
By the refutation of god’s creatorship, his omniscience also is understood to be set aside by the same; as it is on the strength of ‘creatorship’ that the argument for ‘omniscience’ has been based
Your reasonings may not be beset with the defects urged above; and yet the creator cannot be one, because the falsity of such a proposition has been shown above; and when the oneness of the creator is not proved, wherein could ‘omniscience’ subsist?a) 
Your reasonings may not be beset with the defects urged above; and yet the creator cannot be one, because the falsity of such a proposition has been shown above; and when the oneness of the creator is not proved, wherein could ‘omniscience’ subsist?a)

The doctrines of ‘god’ or ‘primordial matter’ severally being the cause (of the world) having been refuted,—it follows that these two together cannot be the ‘maher’ of things produced
The doctrines of ‘god’ or ‘primordial matter’ severally being the cause (of the world) having been refuted,—it follows that these two together cannot be the ‘maher’ of things produced
As for their ‘association’ assumed on the basis op their acting jointly,—this could be due either (a) to the creation op some peculiarity, or (b) to their serving a common purpose. (a) The former op these assumptions cannot be right, as both are ‘unmodifiable’; (b) nor is the latter acceptable; as that would lead to the absurdity op all products coming into existence simultaneously
The theistic Sāṃkhya may argue as follows:—“it is a well-established pact that primordial matter is triple in its essence;—when the supreme lord comes into contact with the manifested rajas-aspect (energy), he becomes the cause of creation;—when again, he has recourse to the manifested sattva-aspect (harmony), then he becomes the cause of the subsistence of the world;—when he comes into contact with the manifestly operative tamas-aspect (inertia), then he brings about the dissolution of the entire world. thus the attributes of harmony, energy and the rest are his auxiliaries, and these become operative only consecutively; that is why there is no absence of consecutiveness (i.e. simultaneity) of products.” 
The answer to this is as follows at the time that the two are performing one act (of creating or maintaining or dissolving),—is their capacity to perform the other acts present? or is it not present?—If it is present, then at the time of creation, the other two acts also should come about;—thus whenever any one of the acts would be there, the other two would have to be there! 
As a matter of fact, the two (primordial matter and god) are the cause of the other two acts also, not in any other form than the one that brings about the one act; the form of the cause remains the same; why then should there be any cessation of the functioning of any act at all? 
If there were disappearance of any particular potency, then the cause could never be productive of its particular effect;—because it is devoid of that potency at some other time; just like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such other things
If the manifested form of the potency had that same (primordial matter and god) for its cause, then, that would continue to be there at all times, because of the proximity of the cause, which is eternal
b) As regards the second alternative, that cannot be accepted by the other party; and for that very reason, it could not be the effect of some other cause
c) Nor can it be self-sufficient; as it appears only at certain times
If it were self-produced, then it would be causeless; as any operation of a thing upon itself is a contradiction in terms.—if there were dependence (upon something else) then the effects would be such as would appear at only certain times
For instance, mere negation (absence) is not regarded as having any action upon itself;—as for the well-established positive entity, it is well known and recognised under the circumstances
If its own ‘essence’ is still unestablished, it cannot be operated upon by anything;—because it is bereft of all potency,—like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things
If its own ‘essence’ is still unestablished, it cannot be operated upon by anything;—because it is bereft of all potency,—like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things
The propounders of the doctrine of the ‘thing- by itself’ describe the origination of things as being independent of all causes. they do not declare even the thing itself to be its own ‘cause 
The propounders of the doctrine of the ‘thing- by itself’ describe the origination of things as being independent of all causes. they do not declare even the thing itself to be its own ‘cause 
Who makes the diversity in the lotus and its filaments, eto.? by whom too have the variegated wings of the peacock and such things been created?” 
Just as the sharpness and other properties of the thorn and other things must be regarded as without cause, on the ground of their appearing at certain times only,—so also must pain and other (internal) things be regarded as without cause” 
As regards the lotus and its filaments, etc., it is definitely ascertained through perception and non-apprehension that they have their ‘ cause ’ in the seed, clay, water and the rest under certain peculiar conditions,—with which latter they are positively and negatively concomitant ;—such being the case, what other ‘ cause ’ can there be of those, which you are asking about ? 
Particular points of place and time also are related (as cause) to things.—“how so?”—if the said points were not the cause of things, these would be produced everywhere and at all times
115) As a matter of fact however things are found to be produced specifically at a certain place, at a certain time and in certain receptacles,—being dependent upon these and independent of all others
What is meant by their being ‘dependent’ is that they come into existence in that manner; so that it is the character of ‘effect’ that is spoken of as ‘dependence that things come into existence in that manner is a perceptible fact; hence the said causes become duly established
Thus the doctrine of the ‘thing by itself’ is discarded by perception; specially as the exact nature of the ‘cause5 of things is duly ascertained through perception and non-apprehension
It may be that there are no proofs for the existence of the ‘cause’ of things; but the mere absence of proof (means of cognising) cannot prove the non-existence of any thing
Inasmuch as ‘proof’ (means of cognition) is not pervasive of the ‘existence of the thing’; nor is it its ‘cause’,a) because there is difference, (b) because there is non-concomitance, and (c) because it proceeds from that,—[mere absence of proof cannot prove the non-existence of a thing]
When a thing is neither the one nor the other, its absence does not conclusively preclude the other thing; because there is no connection
Non-perception’ by all persons is doubtful; ‘non-perception’ by any one person himself is inconclusive; as it is found that the grass and other things growing in the caves of the vindhya mountain do exist, even though they are not perceived
If no reason is adduced to prove the fact of things having no cause, then, inasmuch nothing can be proved without reason, your theory is not proved.—if, on the other hand, you do adduce a reason proving it,—then also your theory is not proved,—as the proving itself would be produced by the proof adduced [which would therefore be the cause of the proving]
As regards the indicative,—be it in the form of the probans, or in the form of words expressive of that (probans),—it is said to be ‘indicative’ of the probandum (desired conclusion), only when it becomes the ‘cause’ of the proving (making known) [of the said conclusion]
Thus it is really the ‘productive’ cause which is spoken of as ‘indicative’; it is because it does not actually produce (bring into existence) what is desired to be accomplished that it is not called ‘productive’
From all this it follows that other things also have their ‘causes’,—as their production is restricted,—just like your cognition of the probandum appearing when the probans is there
From all this it follows that other things also have their ‘causes’,—as their production is restricted,—just like your cognition of the probandum appearing when the probans is there
The whole lot of things is recognised as evolved out of that brahman which is of the essence of word-sound, the highest,—unaffected by destruction and origination.” 
The whole lot of things is recognised as evolved out of that brahman which is of the essence of word-sound, the highest,—unaffected by destruction and origination.” 
Those people who assert the above view should be addressed as follows:—[when the blue and other things evolve out of the said sound] does—or does not—the sound abandon its sound-form and take up the blue and other forms?—if it is the first alternative (that it does abandon its own form) that is accepted, then the sound becomes deprived of its imperishability,—inasmuch as its previous form has become destroyed.—if the second alternative is accepted, then, on the cognition of the blue and other things, even the deaf should have the clear perception of the sound-form
It would be as asserted above] because all things (according to you) exist primarily in the eorm of sound; and if the sound-form is not abandoned, there can be no modification (evolution)
The identity (of sound) with blue and other things being not figurative (but real),—why should not there be cognition of sound at the time that the blue and other things are cognised? 
If there were no cognition of it (sound), then there should be none of the blue and other things also; because both are of the same essence. in case they had different properties, there would be absolute difference between them
What indicates difference among a number of things is the presence of incompatible properties; otherwise, no difference could even be assumed among diverse individuals
If the one ‘sound-essence’ be held to be different with each individual thing, then all things would occupy the same point in space and would be cognised in one and the same form
If (on the other hand) it differs with each individual (thing), then brahman becomes many,—as having a form which is diverse and of the nature of several things,—just like the diversity of individuals
If things consisted of eternal ‘sound’, they also would be eternal; and hence as things would be accomplished simultaneously with the sound, no ‘modification’ would be compatible
There could be ‘modification’ only if there were disappearance of one form followed by the appearance of another form,—as is found to be the case with ölay and other things;—it could not be possible however if all appeared without sequence (simultaneously)
If the world be regarded as ‘consisting of sound’ in the form of ‘product’ (not eternal),—even so, as sound would be unmodifiable, there could be no sequential appearance
If, from sound which is of one form always, diverse forms are produced, then how is it that the world is spoken of as ‘evolved’ in the form of the object? 
In the case of such diverse things as the jar, the pail and the like, it is found that all of them are of the nature of clay, which differentiates them from all that is not-clay; and on the basis of this it is assumed that in all these there subsists the one ‘clay-nature’—no such nature however is perceived in the case of such things as the blue, the yellow and so forth; hence the assumption of any such one nature as is preclusive of all that is not-sound would be absolutely baseless.— 
If it be held that—“Brahman in its essence remains ever undifferentiated; it is only under disturbance due to ignorance that people regard it as diverse”
Even so, what is actually perceived in the form of blue and the; rest by persons tramelled by nescience which form serves as the basis of rejecting and acquiring certain things,—apart from that form, what is there in the form of ‘Brahman’, unperceived, which could be cognised as ‘existing by persons whose mind has risen above (the shackles of nescience)? 
The undifferentiated Brahman cannot be proved by perception, because it never appears in that form;—and as nothing can be produced from what is eternal, there can be no probans in the form of an effect (which could lead to the inference of Brahman); and as the very existence of the thing itself (Brahman) is still unproved, no character of its own could serve as the probans leading to the inference (of the said Brahman); and apart from these two, there can be no probans which could prove the existence (of Brahman)
All consciousness must be consecutive, as it must follow the order of sequence of the objects cognised; if it were not so, its effect in the form of cognition would come about simultaneously.—hence even in the effect in the form of ‘cognition’, there is nothing, apart from the rejecting and acquiring, which could be within the powers of brahman; so that it becomes reduced to the position of the ‘son of the barren woman’
For the same reason even mystics with their ‘chain of pure consciousness’ do not know that form of brahman; as the necessary connection could be possible only after an action of the cognition itself
This doctrine of ‘Brahman’ also is similar to the doctrine of the ‘evolution from primordial matter’; and the objections urged against this latter should be understood to be applicable to the former also
This doctrine of ‘Brahman’ also is similar to the doctrine of the ‘evolution from primordial matter’; and the objections urged against this latter should be understood to be applicable to the former also
Others, however, postulate the ‘puruṣa’ (spirit),—similar in character to ‘god’—as the cause of the world,—their mind being swayed by an ill-conceived doctrine. thus ‘spirit’ has his powers such as do not cease even in regard to the dissolution of all things; he is the cause of all born things, just as the spider is of the cobwebs
Others, however, postulate the ‘puruṣa’ (spirit),—similar in character to ‘god’—as the cause of the world,—their mind being swayed by an ill-conceived doctrine. thus ‘spirit’ has his powers such as do not cease even in regard to the dissolution of all things; he is the cause of all born things, just as the spider is of the cobwebs
The reputation of this also is to be set forth, in the same manner as that of ‘god’: for what purpose does this ‘spirit’ perform such an act (as the creating, etc. of the world)? 
If he does it because he is prompted by another being, then he can not be self-sufficient (independent).—if he does it through compassion, then he should make the world absolutely happy. when he is found to have created people beset with misery, poverty, sorrow and other troubles,—where can his compassion be perceived? 
Further, inasmuch as, prior to creation, the objects of compassion would not be there,—there could not be even that compassion through the presence op which the ordainer is assumed
Nor should he ever bring about the dissolution op those beings who would be always prosperous. if in so doing, he be regarded as dependent upon the ‘unseen force’ (op destiny), then his ‘self-sufficiency’ ceases
Then again, why should he make himself dependent upon that destiny, which is conducive to suffering and pain? in fact, pull of mercy as he is, the right course for him would be to ignore that destiny
If the functioning of the spirit be said to be for purposes of ‘amusement’, then he would not be his own master regarding that amusement, as he would be dependent upon the various implements of that amusement,—just like a child
If he had the power to create them, he would have created, at one and the same time, all the implements conducive to the pleasure to be accomplished by the ‘amusement’.—if he did not have that power in the beginning, then he could not have it for creating them consecutively either. because for an indivisible thing, it is not possible to have power and also to be without power
If it be held that “the functioning at the beginning of creation is due to his nature,—just like the functioning of fire and such things towards burning and such effects, which is due to their very nature”;—then, under the circumstances, all things should come into existence simultaneously; because of the presence of the cause fully competent to produce them
In the case of such things as fire and the like, their powers are dependent upon the efficiency of their own causes, and hence restricted in their operations, and consequently not effective at all times. if it were not so, all effects would come into existence simultaneously,—if in their case also there were no such restriction
In the case of the spider also, the causal capacity to produce the cobwebs is not admitted (by us) to be due to its very nature; what produces them is the saliva emitted by the spider’s eager desire to devour insects
If the functioning (of the spirit) be ‘somehow’ (unintentional),—then what sort of ‘intelligence’ is his?—since even the fisherman does not act without thinking over the effect of his action

Others again postulate the ‘self’ (soul) as the substratum of desire and the rest,—which, by itself, is not of the nature of consciousness, but is eternal and all-pervasive;—it is the doer of good and bad acts and the enjoyer of the fruit of these; it is ‘conscious’, not by itself, but through the presence of consciousness;—the presence of cognition, effort, etc. as also the character of being the ‘doer’ is attributed to it. its being the ‘enjoyer’ (experiencer) consists in the subsistence in it of the feelings of pleasure, pain and the like;—contact with physical body and with special unprecedented cognitions and feelings is called its ‘birth’; and dissociation from these same as taken up before is called its ‘death’; its ‘rebirth’ consists in becoming equipped with a body and mind, under the influence of merit and demerit. it is assumed to be ‘hurt’ by the hurting of its body, eyes and the rest; so that though it is eternal, the said process (of birth and rebirth) has been held to be unobjectionable

My cognitions are apprehended by a gogniser distinct from my body, etc.—because they are cognitions,—like cognitions other than mine
All such things as desire and the rest must subsist in something; because while being entities, they are effects,—like colour.—this something is the spirit (soul). the presence of the qualifying phrase ‘while being entities’ saves the argument from being ‘untrue’ (fallible), in regard to destruction; because though destruction is an effect (has a cause), yet it is not an ‘entity’.” 
All cognitions of colour, etc. should be regarded as having one and also several causes,—because they are recalled by the notion of ‘being cognised by me’;—just like the cognitions of several men regarding the glances of the dancing girl. if it were otherwise, there could be no ‘recalling’, as there would be no basis for it.” 
The term ‘Ātman’ (soul) must be expressive of something distinct from the aggregate of intellect, sense-organs and the rest,—because it is held to be a single term, while being different from the well-known synonyms of those terms;—whatever is definitely known as fulfilling these conditions is always qualified by the said property; as is found in the case of the term ‘cloth’.” 
This living body would be devoid of breathing and other functions,—because it would be soul-less,—like the jar. hence it cannot be soul-less.” 
All subsequent cognitions are apprehended by that same cogniser who apprehended the first cognition immediately on birth,—because they are my cognitions,—like that first forerunner of those cognitions.” 
Earth and the rest, even though existing at a place remote from me, are yet connected with my soul,—because they have a material form, etc.,—just like my own body.” 
Thus the existence, eternality and omnipresence of the soul being definitely proved,—it becomes established that nothing is soul-less.” 
As regards the first argument that has been put forward, it is open to the charge of ‘proving what is already admitted’ (futile); as the apprehensibility of your cognition by the omniscient person and others is already admitted (by us)
Whenever consciousness appears, it appears in its own form, independently of any other ‘illuminator’; so also the ‘cognition of other persons’;—hence your instance is devoid of the probandum
Even if the instance meant be that cognition which is cognised as tinged by the form of the thing concerned,—it would be doubtful in regard to another cognition
If (by the argument set forth under text 178), it is sought to be proved that desire and the rest must subsist somewhere,—and that the ‘cause’ only can be such a substratum,—you seek to prove what is already accepted by us. if however it is the receptacle (or container) that is meant by you to be the ‘substratum’ (of desire, etc.),—then also the assuming of a ‘receptacle’ for what is immobile is absolutely useless
The pit and other things can be the ‘receptacle’ of the jujube fruit and other things, because they serve to obstruct their movement, or because they bring about specific changes
It is not reasonable to regard ‘destruction’, which is formless, as a ‘product’; hence the qualification mentioned in the reasoning of the other party is entirely useless
The ‘recalling’ of such notions as ‘by me (seen, heard)’, etc. must be due to perturbations of ignorance; as such notions of the one-ness of the agent (perceiver) are found to appear also in connection with all momentary things. from this false assumption, it cannot be right to deduce any conclusion regarding the true state of things; specially as even things that are diverse by reason of the diversity of their powers become the basis of an effect conceived of as one
If many things—such as the cognitions of colour, sound and the rest,—were the effects of a single continuous (permanent) cause,—then any order of sequence among such effects would be incongruous; as their efficient cause would be always there
Inasmuch as the appearance of six cognitions out of a single preceding cognition is clearly recognised simultaneously,—what your argument proves is admitted (by us)
That things appearing consecutively, one after the other, cannot have one and the same cause, has just been pointed out. for this reason, herein the (opponent’s) premiss asserting the invariable concomitance is found to be clearly annulled by inference
As for the ‘glance of the dancing girl’, it is not really a single entity; in fact it is made up of several minute particles; and its ‘one-ness’ is only assumed
In the case of synonyms,—such as ‘buddhi’, ‘citta’ and the rest,—we find that though each of them is a single term, yet it does not express a thing different (from that expressed by others);—hence your reason is ‘inconclusive’.—“but a qualification (in the form ‘as apart from recognised synonyms’) has been added.”—our answer to that is that the qualification is not ‘admitted’, as the fact remains that the ‘soul’ is synonymous with ‘consciousness’; as it is consciousness itself, as the substratum of ‘i-consciousness’, that is spoken of as the ‘soul all this has been said by us on the basis of ‘illusory conception’; in reality, there is nothing that is denoted by the term in question (‘soul’)
The reason is found to be false also; when, for instance, names, such as ‘kāraka’ (active agent), and the like, are applied to things like the ‘sky-lotus 
The use of] terms being based entirely on convention,—what is there to which they cannot be applied?—In the case of terms like ‘soul’ also, there is nothing in their very nature which is expressive of anything
The contingency that has been urged would be right if the connection between the functions of breathing, etc. and the soul were well-established; otherwise, it would be absurd. for instance, the absence of the ‘son of the barren woman’ cannot make the living body devoid of breathing, etc. and your urging of the contingency in question is of the same kind
Thus the existence of the ‘soul’ not being proved by any of the proofs (put forward), the instances that have been cited of ‘eternality’ and ‘omnipresence’ become ‘devoid of the probandum’
Others have assumed that the ‘soul’ is proved by perception; because ‘i-consciousness’ is self-cognisable, and the soul forms the object of that consciousness
This is not right; because as a matter of fact, the form of the ‘soul’ does hot become manifest in ‘I-consciousness’; therein is not perceived any manifestation of eternality, omnipresence and such properties (postulated of the soul); what is clearly present therein, on the other hand, is the ‘fair complexion’, etc.; and the ‘soul’ is not held to be of the nature of these latter;—hence the ‘soul’ cannot be an object of ‘I-consciousness’
If the soul were really amenable to perception, then wherefore should this dispute arise regarding its existence and other things? 
The ‘I-consciousness’ always functions in the form of a definite cognition; and between a definite cognition and a mere indefinite conception, there is always the relation of ‘the annuller and the annulled’, 
Thus it follows that desire and all the rest cannot subsist in the ‘soul’;—because they appear successively,—like the ‘seed—sprout—creeper’.—Or, all psychical (subjective) concepts must be regarded as having their forms obsessed by ‘absence of soul’,—because of such reasons as ‘being things’, ‘being existent’ and so forth,—just like the jar and other external objects
If the things in question were connected with the soul, then the things caused by that (soul) would have to be regarded as eternal; and being eternal, they would yet be powerless for effective action. consequently it would not be possible for them to have the properties of ‘existence’ and the rest
That ‘negation of the soul’ which other people seek to prove in regard to the jar and other things,—that same we are going to prove in regard to the living body
Thus the ‘soul’ being something ‘not-proyed’, the entire fabric (of conceptions) that has been adopted in regard to it, becomes baseless like ‘the son of the barren woman’
Others again have declared the ‘soul’ to be of the nature of caitanya, sentience, exclusive and inclusive in character;—this caitanya (sentience) being the same as buddhi (intelligence)
Just as, in the case of the serpent, the ‘coiled’ form disappears, and after that, appears the ‘straightened’ form; but the character of being ‘serpent’ continues through both states;—in the same manner, in the case of the soul, there is no complete disappearance of the character of ‘eternal sentience’; nor is there continuance of its whole character; there is disappearance of such of its states as ‘pleasure’, ‘pain’ and the like,—and these appear again; but through all these ‘sentience’ continues.” 
If there were absolute destruction of the soul, there would be ‘destruction of what is done and the befalling of what is not done’; and if the soul always remained of the same form, then there could be no experiencing of pleasure, pain and the rest.” 
The soul’s characters of ‘doer’ and ‘experiencer’ are not dependent upon the state; hence, as it is the soul itself that remains the same through the various states, it is the doer of the act that always obtains (experiences) the fruit of that act.” 
The spirit (or soul) as described is proved by the presence of recognition; and the doctrine of ‘no-soul’ is disproved by this same (recognition).” 
The notion of ‘I’ involved in the conception ‘I know’ envisages the cogniser; this cogniser may be either the ‘soul’ or the absolutely evanescent ‘cognition’ (idea). If it is the ‘soul’ that is the objective of that notion, then all is square; on the other hand, if the momentary ‘cognition’ (idea) is held to be so, then all becomes inexplicably confounded. For instance, the notion that appears in the form ‘it was I who cognised this thing on a previous occasion, and it is I who am cognising it now’,—of this notion, what ‘cognitive moment’ is assumed to be the objective? would such a ‘moment’ be (a) past, or (b) present, or (c) in the form of a continued series? if it be the first (a), the moment could well be the objective of the notion ‘I cognised it (in the past)’; but it could not be the objective of the notion ‘I am cognising it (now)’, because the cogniser is not cognising the thing at the moment of speaking; it is only when the object is present at the time (of cognition) that it can be spoken of as ‘I am cognising it but (in regard to such a present object) it would not be true to say ‘I cognised it’, because the object did not exist in the past.—From this it follows that both of these (past and present) cannot form the objective of the said notion. Nor did both ‘cognitive moments’ cognise the thing in the past; nor do they both cognise it in the present
c) Nor can the ‘series’ be regarded as the ‘cognised object’, as both are impossible; the ‘series’ could not cognise it in the past; and as it is not an entity, it cannot cognise in the present.—For all these reasons, it is established that that wherein ‘I-consciousness’ subsists,—which must be something distinct from the said cognition,—is the ‘soul’ of the eternal form.” 
The ‘cogniser’ who formed the object of ‘I-consciousness’ in the past must be regarded as continuing to exist to-day,—because he is the object of ‘I-consciousness’,—like the cogniser in the present.—Or, he (the present cogniser) must be regarded as haying been the cogniser of yesterday,—because he is the cogniser;—or because of the same reason (of being the object of ‘I-consciousness’),—like the cogniser of yesterday; and all these fulfill the conditions of the probandum.” 
All (I-notions) of yesterday and of to-day must have the same object,—because they are i-notions belonging to the cogniser connected with one and the same ‘chain’,—like any single cognition.” 
In this connection, the following points are to be considered:—if intelligence is held to be eternal and one, then, cognition also should have to be regarded as of the same character
Cognitions, and the soul also, are held to be eternal and one, on the ground of their being of the nature of ‘intelligence’; if there is diversity, it is due to the object.” 
Though, by its very nature, fire is always of the nature of a burner, it burns only what is presented to it,—and that also only a thing that is capable of being burnt,—not any other thing, nor at any other time.” 
Or, the clean mirror, or the rock-crystal, reflects the image of only what is placed before it in the same manner, souls, though possessed of eternal sentience, apprehend colour and other things only when they are themselves in the body and the things are presented to them by the organs. and it is this sentience that we call ‘intelligence’.” 
It is on account of the evanescent character of the functioning of the presenting organs that the cognition is evanescent; just as, even though fire is always a burner, it burns only when the combustible thing is close to it.” 
Cognition is always recognised as being of the nature of ‘intelligence’; as regards the cognitions of the jar, the elephant and so forth, their diversity is held by people to be due to the diversity among those things.” 
People who follow up the diversity among the objects cognised do not speak of the cognition as ‘that same cognition’; nor is there non-recognition of it as ‘cognition so long as notice is not taken of the diversity among the objects.” 
If such is the case, then, on the occasion when there appear. cognitions imposing the concepts of ‘elephant’ and the rest in reference to spots where these animals do not exist,—to what is the diversity in such cognitions due? 
If the individual objects existing at other times and places be held to supply the basis for such imposed cognitions,—on the ground that in all cognitions the basis of reality is supplied by objects existing at times and places other than those of the appearance of the cognitions themselves,—[then the answer would be as stated in the following text]
But as a matter of fact, the cognitions in question have no such connection with that particular place; why then should they appear in that form at that place? 
Then again, under your view, the external form is not declared to belong to the cognition; nor are the elephant, pole and other things actually existent at the place desired
If cognition remains for ever in the form of the apprehension of all things,—then how is it that the cognition of all things is not present at all times? 
That cognition on which sound has been imposed must be the same that apprehends taste, colour and other things. if this is not admitted by you, then you have, by your own words, admitted that there is difference among cognitions
Even fire is not always a ‘burner’ of all combustible things; otherwise the whole (world) would be instantly reduced to ashes
In fact, it is only when it is in close proximity to the combustible thing that fire can be rightly regarded as the burner; thus it is why there does not happen the contingency of all things being burnt all at once
All such things as the mirror, the rock-crystal and the like are themselves in perpetual flux; and when they become connected with the blue lotus and such objects,—they become causes of bringing about the illusion regarding their reflections.—If that were not so, everyone of those things would be always one and the same,—when in contact with the said objects, as well as when not in contact with them; and as such it should be seen either as always with its reflection or always without its reflection
As a matter of fact, the mirror-surface can never contain the reflection (of anything),—because it is lasting, because it is indivisible, and because several things with material shape cannot subsist together
Persons standing on the two sides of it perceive only the purely white rock-crystal; hence it follows that this also does not become transformed into the reflection
The opponent’s theory would also entail the incongruity of the rock-crystal becoming different with each object placed before it,—if there were a real transformation of it into the reflection
From this it follows that the said perception of the reflection is an illusion,—appearing in connection with things possessed of diverse unthinkable potencies
262a) 
In the case of cognition, there cannot be even illusion; as there is absence of difference
262b) 
The character of being different from non-cognition is one that is common to all cognitions; and the said recognition could proceed on the basis of the imposition of that common character,—even under the view of cognitions being many and diverse
The permanent soul having been absolutely established as devoid of diversity due to the diversity of states,—what people assume to be the states of happiness and unhappiness and the rest,—even when undergoing all these states, my person (soul) does not renounce his character of being sentient, being a substance, being an entity and so forth.” [Ślokavārtika, page 695] 
Even on the appearance of a new state, the preceding state is not entirely destroyed; it becomes merged into the common character, in order to help the appearance of the next state.” [Ślokavārtika, page 596] 
The states, in their own forms, are mutually incompatible; as for the common character, however, it is not incompatible with any state, and it is actually recognised, in its common form, in all states.” Ślokavārtika, page 696 
If the states are not entirely different from the soul, then there should be destruction and origination of the soul also, following upon the destruction and origination of the states
If there be presence of contradictory properties, then there should be absolute difference; just as in the case of your souls which are absolutely different from each other, through the distinctive character belonging to each of them
If your ‘states’ become merged into the soul in their own form, then, on the appearance of happxness, unhappiness also should be felt
As a matter of fact, when there is transference of one form to something, there can be no transference of another form. so that if the states became transferred (merged into the soul) in their own form, then the soul also would be something liable to origination
If the characters of doer and experiencer are not dependent upon the state,—then the said characters cannot belong to the soul,—as they can belong to only one who has that state
For these reasons, we are not denying the fact of the soul being spoken of by the term ‘eternal’; but on account of its form being subject to modification, there mest be destrection of it
The serpent also is liable to become crooked and so forth, becaese it is sebject to perpetual flex; if it had a permanent form, then, like the soul, it could neyer come by another state
As a matter of fact, the ‘notion of I’ comes about without a real basis, through the force of the beginningless seed of the vision of being; and that also only in some places
It is only some (not all) impressions that secure the requisite potency for bringing about the said notion apprehending that particular form; hence it does not appear everywhere
If this were not so,—the objection in question could be urged with equal force against your ‘soul’ also; but all difficulties are removed by the fact that there is diversity in its potencies
If the said notion (of ‘I’) had an eternal thing for its basis, then all ‘I-notions’ would come about all at once, as their efficient cause would be always present.—if it had a non-eternal basis, then all these notions would be equally clearly manifest. hence (it follows that) the other parties needlessly raise questions regarding the existence of the basis of the said I-notion
What the disposition can do is to bring about the recognition of the cogniser; it cannot bring about the cognition of a thing as what it is not; because it cannot be the cause of illusion (wrong cognition).—Thus the ‘I-notion’ cannot be regarded as an illusion; as there is nothing to annul it (and hence prove it to be wrong)”;—[Ślokavārtika, page 720]—if this is urged [then the answer is as given in the following text]
280-281a) What has been urged is hot right; as the reasoning adduced above is clearly found to be subversive of the said idea
281b) 
How is it that, entirely from dispositions,—such diverse illusions come about as those that devotees have in regard to god and other beings as being the cause of things and so forth? 
Thus then, the baselessness of ‘I-consciousness’ having been established, there can be no cogniser who could be apprehended by the said ‘notion of I’. Hence among all valid forms of cognition, there is not one which is found able to supply a fit example; and the reasons also that have been adduced in due course are found to be ‘unproven’ regarding their substratum
Others hold caitanya ‘sentience’ to be distinct from the form of buddhi, intellect (cognition). They postulate ‘sentience’ as the ‘spirit’s’ own form; he only enjoys the fruits presented to him by primordial matter; he is not the ‘doer’; the character of ‘doer’ is held to belong to primordial matter alone
As regards this doctrine, if ‘sentience’ is held to be one only, then how is it that, in the cognitions of colour, sound and other objects, what is clearly perceived is a form beset with diversity?. 
If ‘sentience’ is of one form and continues to exist for all time, then, how is it possible for the sentient soul to be the enjoyer of things of many kinds? 
The ‘desire to see’ and the like, which are diverse, do not come into existence as forming the basis of the spirit’s experience; for, if they did so, then the soul itself would be something produced
The ‘desire to see’ and the rest are not anything distinct prom ‘sentience’; and if this latter were liable to ‘appearance and disappearance’, then the same could not be denied of the soul
If good and bad deeds are not done by the soul, then wherefrom does this diversity in his experiences proceed? 
If it be held that—“it is primordial matter that bestows the fruits, in accordance with the desires of the soul; and this relationship between the two stands like that between the lame and the blind persons”,—[then the answer is as given in the following text]
If that is so, then how is it that even when the desire for the desired thing is there, it is not fulfilled? primordial matter cannot stand in need of anything else
If, at the time op his enjoying a thing, there is no modification in the soul,—then he cannot be the enjoyer; nor can primordial matter be of any service to him.—If (on the other hand) there is modification in him, then his eternality disappears; as ‘modification’ consists in becoming changed into something else; and how could any such change be possible if the soul remained in the same condition always? 
The following might be urged—“first of all the cosmic intellect becomes evolved in the form of the object; and when this object has been ‘determined upon’ (defined) by cosmic intellect, the spirit attains it. thus his character of being the ‘enjoyer’ is through the appearance of the reflection; and the spirit never renounces his own nature.” 
Our answer to this is as follows:—If the reflection appears in the same form (as the reflecting substance), then the same liability to ‘appearance and disappearance’ remains.—If, on the other hand, it is different, then the spirit cannot be the enjoyer
If primordial matter operates towards bringing about the diversified creation, in accordance with the (spirit’s) ‘desire to see’ and the rest,—then how can it be insentient? 
Primordial matter knows how to produce the soup and other things, and yet does not know how to eat (enjoy) them,—what can be more incongruous than this? 
If it be argued that—“inasmuch as primordial matter is equipped with cosmic intellect, all this cannot be incompatible with its nature”,—then, on the ground of its being equipped with intellect, it would have to be possessed of sentience also,—like the sentience in spirits. because ‘intellect’, ‘volition’, ‘consciousness’, ‘feeling’, ‘knowing’,—all this is expressive of sentience
Cosmic intellect must be insentient by its nature,—like sound odour, taste and other things,—on account of the two reasons of being produced and being perishable”,—if this be your view—[then the answer is as stated in the following text]
If the reasons adduced are meant to be self-sufficient, then they are not admitted by both (parties); if the reasons are meant to be indirect, then there is nothing to annul the contrary conclusion
There is no harm done to us by the mere application of the term ‘spirit’ to sentience; what we assert is that its eternality is difficult to prove; because the eye and other things serve a fruitful purpose. if sentience were everlasting, then all such things as the eye and the rest would be useless; e.g. there would be no use for the fuel if fire were everlasting
The fact of the eye etc. being for ‘another’s use’ is asserted (by the sāṃkhya), on the ground of their being ‘composite things’, like the bed, seat and such things.—If it is meant by this to prove that they serve the purpose of something else which is capable of having additional properties produced in it,—then what is sought to be proved is already admitted; inasmuch as the said eye etc. are admitted by us to be helpful to cognition. On the other hand, if it is meant to prove that they are helpful to something that is unmodifiable,—then the reasoning is open to the fallacy of the corroborative instance being devoid of the probandum; as the things cited as the instance are also helpful only to what is mobile (perishable).—Lastly, if what is meant to be proved is merely the vague general fact of their being helpful to ‘another’,—even so, the reason would be superfluous; as they are already admitted to be helpful to the mind
This Jainas, like the Mīmāṃsakas, assert that the person (soul) is characterised by ‘sentience’; that, in the form of ‘substance’, it is inclusive, and in the form of ‘successive factors’, it is exclusive
Under this view also, if. the unmodified substance is connected with the successive factors, then there is no difference (change) in it, and, in that case, it could not be liable to modification
When sentience is spoken of as ‘one’, it is with reference to space, time and nature; when it is spoken of as ‘different’, it is with reference to number, characteristic, name and function.—When we speak of the ‘jar’ (singular) and its ‘colour and the rest’ (plural), there is difference of ‘number’ and ‘name’; there is also difference of ‘nature’, inasmuch as ‘inclusiveness’ (comprehensiveness) is the nature of the substance jar, while ‘exclusiveness’ (distributiveness) is the nature of the successive factors in the form of colour and the rest; and there is difference also of ‘function’; inasmuch as the purposes served by the two are different.—Similarly between the ‘sub stance’ and the ‘successive factors’.—Thus substance is not absolutely undifferentiated, as it does become differentiated in the form of the successive factors 
One-ness’ (sameness, identity) consists in non-difference of nature were there if this ‘one-ness’ (between two things), then ‘difference’ (between them) world be hard to prove in any way; as in the case of the forms of the successive factors themselves
316) commentary. 
The ‘one-ness’ thus between ‘substance’ and the ‘successive factors’ being not-figurative (i.e. real), the ‘substance’ also should be distributive (exclusive), like the forms of the ‘successive factors’; or those ‘successive factors’ themselves should be comprehensive in their character, like the ‘substance because the one-ness of these with ‘substance’ is duly established
From all this it follows that there is no such lasting ‘substance’ as the ‘soul’ and the like; because they are not different from the ‘successive factors’,—like the form of the ‘successive factors’ themselves
None of the ‘successive factors’ also can be beset with ‘appearance and disappearance’,—because they are non-different from ‘substance’,—like the permanent form of the ‘substance.’ 
For this reason it should be admitted, either that there is absolute destruction of all, or that all is permanent (eternal); exclusiveness and inclusiveness could not exist in any single thing
As a matter of fact, there is no perception of ‘substance’, which should be perceptible, as something permeating through (and comprehensive of) the ‘successive factors’,—hence it cannot be regarded as existing,—like the ‘sky-lotus’
In fact, things are capable of diverse fruitful actions;—they are causes of the notions of ‘similarity’ and the best;—and they are amenable to conventional verbal expressions connoting such things
In fact, it is only the ‘successive factors’ that are cognised as characterised by ‘appearance and disappearance’; hence pure ‘soullessness’ becomes clearly established
It might be urged that—“what exists is the mixed form of the ‘substance’ and the ‘successive factors’,—because it is held to be dual in form, but impartite,—like Narasiṃha.” 
The assertion that ‘a certain thing is of dual form’ can be based on the existence of several things,—because the term ‘form’ connotes nature
Narasiṃha also cannot be one and also of ‘dual nature’; as he is perceived as such because he is an aggregate of many atoms
Others assert that—“The earth, eire, water etc. are the illusory modifications of eternal consciousness, and this is what constitutes the ‘soul’.” 
There is nothing in this world which is endowed with the character of apprehensibility; and all this is held to be the illusory modification of consciousness.” 
The error in the view of these philosophers is a slight one,—due only to the assertion of eternality (of cognition); as diversity is clearly perceived in the cognitions of colour, sound and other things.—If all these cognitions were one, then, colour, sound, taste and other things would be cognisable all at once; as in an eternal entity there can be no different states
Cognition or consciousness is never apprehended as anything distinct from the cognitions of colour and other things; and inasmuch as these latter undergo variations every moment, what remains there that could be lasting (permanent, eternal)? 
There can be no distinction in cognition as ‘wrong’ and ‘right’—if the ‘soul’ consists of a single (eternal) cognition; how then can there be any ‘bondage’ and ‘liberation’? 
What could the mystic set aside or accomplish by the practice of yoga? What too is there that could be rejected? As wrong cognition also is of the nature of the same (eternal cognition).—The knowledge of truth also cannot be something to be brought about; as, being of the nature of cognition, it is always there.—So that the entire practice of yoga also is entirely fruitless
Some people who regard themselves as ‘Bauddhas’ describe the soul by the name of ‘pudgala’, and declare it to be neither the same as, nor different fromthe skandhas, thought-phases)
The ‘pudgala’ cannot be spoken of as ‘different’ from the thought-phases,—as in that case this doctrine would be the same as those of the ‘tairthika philosophers’;—nor can it be spoken of as the ‘same’ (non-different); as, in that case, it would have to be regarded as ‘more than one’ (many) and so forth;—hence it is best to regard it as ‘incapable of being spoken of’ (as either the one or the other)
These people should be told that (according to what they have said), the pudgala cannot be regarded as existing in reality;—because it is incapable of being spoken of either as the same or as different (from thought-phases);—just like the ‘sky-lotus’ and such non-entities
A thing cannot escape being either ‘same as’ or ‘different from’, another thing; in fact, it is only what is entirely formless that can be regarded as ‘incapable of being so spoken of 
It is only an entity that can be liable to the alternatives of being ‘different’ or ‘non-different’; hence it is only in regard to things that are formless (i.e. non-entities) that it can be correct not to speak of them either as ‘different’ or ‘non-different’ (from one another);—not so in regard to an entity;—because in the case of the denial ‘this is not what that is,—like a different thing’,—it is difference that is clearly spoken of;—similarly when there is denial ‘this is not what that is not’, what is clearly spoken of is non-difference (between the two); thus it is that an entity can never escape from being either different or non-different from another entity
Your words that “the pudgala is not different from the thought-phases’ are a clear assertion of its non-difference; while the words ‘the thought-phase is not the pudgala’ clearly asserts its difference
The presence of contrary properties is spoken of as constituting ‘difference’ among entities; is there no such ‘difference’ between the pudgala and the thought-phases? 
For instance, the pudgala is said to be ‘incapable of being spoken of’ as different or non-different from feeling and the rest, while colour, name and other things are said to be ‘capable of being spoken of’ as different from them
The ‘colour-phase’ and the rest are held to be ‘capable of being spoken of’ as ‘non-eternal’; while the pudgala is not so; so that there is a clear difference between the two
Capacity for effective action is the differentia of the existence (of a thing); and such capacity is restricted to momentary entities only; hence if anything is ‘incapable of being spoken of (as momentary)’, it cannot be an existent entity
Great men have successfully explained all those cases where there is conflict between ‘scripture’ and the real state of things. in fact the diverse teachings of the merciful one are for the purpose of rebutting ‘unbelief’ (nāstikya)
The mention of the ‘bearer of the burden’ and so forth is made with the aggregates, etc. in mind; as regards the particular denial,—that is of use against those who hold those views

Or, all this effort (to refute the various doctrines regarding the origin of the world) is made needlessly; as all such doctrines are really set aside by the well-established doctrine of the ‘perfetual flux’ of things.—Hence it is this ‘perpetual flux’ that is going to be clearly established for the refutation of all that has been referred to above and all such things as the ‘universal’ and the like which are going to be mentioned later on,—a refutation that is applied equally to all those doctrines

Some people hold that there are two classes of things—cheated and uncreated; others have held that the two classes op things are momentary and non-momentary
Among these, all those things that are ‘created’ are in ‘perpetual flux’,—because, as regards their destruction, all of them are entirely independent
When a certain thing does not need any other cause for the bringing about op a certain condition, that condition should be regarded as attaching to it permanently,—because, out op its own causes, that thing appears in that condition;—just as the causal conditions are independently, by themselves, capable of producing their effect;—and all the things that are produced are independent op all else in the matter op their destruction
Even though independent, if the destruction were to come at another place and time,—then, on account op its being dependent upon those, the thing could not be regarded as ‘independent’
All produced things are always and everywhere independent in regard to their destruction; as in this matter, all causes of destruction are entirely inefficacious
For instance, the ‘destructive cause’ cannot be rightly regarded as the bringer about op a ‘destruction’ which is not-different prom the thing itself; as the positive thing is produced from its own cause
When a certain thing that comes out of its cause is without parts,—the ‘destruction’ that would be imposed upon it by other causes must be of the same nature
If the destruction that is brought about is something different from the thing, then there is nothing produced in the thing itself by those other causes (of the said destruction); so that the effects, like the apprehension of the thing and other phenomena, should continue as before. and as the thing continues to remain in the same condition, it is not possible that there should be any ‘concealment’ etc. of it
It is not true to assert that “the thing is destroyed by another thing named ‘destruction’”,—because the arguments based upon the alternatives of its being ‘different’ or ‘non-different’ and so forth are applicable, by implication, to such an assertion also
If it be held that—“the ‘destruction’ (‘nāśa’) brought about is of the nature of the ‘negation of entity otherwise called ‘disruption’ (pradhvaṃsa’),—there can be no reasonable cause for that also.—If negation were an effect, then it would be an entity, like the sprout and other effects; because while there is possibility of its being regarded as something ‘not-produced’, it is found to come about through the potency of a cause
The view that ‘negation’ is brought by an ‘affirmation’ has been sought to be supported by haying recourse to ‘preclusion’ (as the form of the negation so brought about);—but the argument based upon the alternatives possible regarding difference or non-difference, all become applicable to this view
If it be held that “what is meant by ‘destruction’ is the negation of effective action, and this does not bring about a positive entity”,—even so, it becomes established that what brings about the destruction cannot be its ‘cause—because it is devoid of the character of ‘cause’
This destruction of the thing is not present at the time that the thing is in existence; nor is it present before (the thing has come into existence); nor very long after (the thing has come into existence), in fact, it comes immediately after (the thing has come into existence); thus, inasmuch as it comes into existence only at a particular time, it must have a cause. If it were independent (of all causes), then this occasional character would be impossible, as shown before 
As it comes immediately after the thing, the destruction must have a cause; also because, not having been in existence, it comes into existence,—just like the following moment.” 
Then again, if destruction had no cause, it would be either a non-entity, like ‘the son of the barren women’ and other non-entities, or an eternal entity, like ākāśa; as no other alternative is possible.—If destruction were a non-entity, then all things would be eternal, as there would be no destruction (of anything); and the idea of the destructibility (fleeting character) of all properties would be baseless.—If destruction were eternal (existing at all times), then it would be possible for the thing to exist along with its own destruction; as there could be no incompatibility in this case; and the assertion of the ‘destruction’ of what has not been produced would not be in keeping with reason.” 
What sort of ‘destruction’ is it (the causelessness of) which the other people object to? (a) Is it the ‘momentary existence’ of things, as explained by us? Or the ‘cessation of the form of the entity’, called ‘disruption’ (dhvaṃsa, annihilation)?—If it is the former, then there is no quarrel
That thing which, having a momentary existence, is called ‘destruction’,—this destruction we also admit as having a muse; it is only the other kind of destruction which we regard as without cause, on the ground of there being nothing else (which could be its cause)
The character of ‘coming immediately after the thing’ does not subsist in the destruction as described; because the destruction in the form of the mobile (momentary) thing appears along with the thing itself
Thus then, the destruction being there, things cannot be eternal; and the notion that ‘things are destructible’ cannot be baseless
As regards ‘annihilation’, as it can have no essence (character), it cannot ‘come into existence immediately after the thing’;—and as regards the presence of the character of ‘coming into existence after having not existed before’, this is precisely like the ‘sky-lotus’ and other things
When it is said that ‘there is annihilation of the thing’, what is meant is that ‘the thing is not there’, and it is not meant to convey the affirmation (predication) of any thing
The mere naming of a person as ‘donkey’ does not lead to the attribution of the whole character of the ass to that person
If the category named ‘annihilation’ were affirmed in reference to a thing, there being nothing actually produced in the thing,—how is it that the thing ceases (to exist)? 
Thus it is that the existence of any ‘destruction of things’ of the nature of ‘annihilation’ is not admitted; because the ‘destruction of a thing’ consists in the dissociation of a particular form, and not in the negation of its existence
When it is asserted that ‘destruction is of the nature of cessation’, it does not mean the affirmation of its positive character; it only denies the continuity of the particular form of the thing beyond one moment. thus no lasting form is affirmed in regard to the ‘annihilation’, and there is no room for the alternative that it is eternal 
The ākāśa and other things which have been held to be ‘uncreated’ are really non-existent, in the form of ‘entities’; as they are devoid of all potentiality; hence there can be no room for attributing to them any such alternative characters as that of ‘momentariness’ or ‘non-momentariness’; whereby they could be regarded even as an ‘entity’—be it either momentary or otherwise
That thing is said to be ‘momentary’ whose form persists for a moment; while that thing is said to be ‘non-momentary’ which is endowed with a lasting (permanent) form
That form of the thing which does not persist after its production is what is called ‘kṣaṇa’, ‘moment’; and that which has this form is held to be ‘kṣaṇika’, ‘momentary 
Even when there is no difference between two things, there is nothing to prevent the notion of ‘this belonging to that’; as every expressive word is applied in accordance with an arbitrary whim
What is meant to be spoken of (by the term ‘kṣaṇika’, ‘momentary’) is the thing that does not continue to exist after its coming into existence; and that term may be used either with the affix or without the affix (to which Uddyotaka has taken objection). 
If ākāśa, time and such things are existent, then, being so, they cannot escape from being momentary,—just like the created things
For instance, whatever things are existent are all in a state of perpetual flux,—just as all created things have just been shown to be;—these things, ākāśa, time, god, and the rest are held by you to be existent;—these could never have an existence if they were devoid op momentariness;—because permanent things cannot have any fruitful activity, either successively or simultaneously,—therefore they are held to be non-existent
Effects are delayed on account of the non-proximity of the cause. if the efficient cause were there, to what would that delay be due? 
Even of the eternal thing, there are certain auxiliaries,—on account of whose help, the former brings about the large number of its effects, in succession”
This is all very well; but when those other things become its ‘auxiliaries’, is it because they are the cause of the causal efficiency (of the permanent thing)? Or because they also serve the same purpose?—If they are the cause of the causal efficiency (of the permanent thing),—then this thing itself would be produced by them; and yet this is incapable of being produced, as it is always there (being permanent). Or, if the very form of the permanent thing were held to be produced (by the auxiliaries), then its eternality (permanence) disappears. If the ‘peculiarity’ (produced in the permanent thing) be regarded as something distinct from the thing itself, then,—how can this (thing) be regarded as the ‘cause’? 
The effects would in that case be produced only when the said ‘condition’ is there,—and they would not be produced when the ‘condition’ is not there and thus it would be this ‘condition’ that would have to be regarded as their cause
It might be argued that—“On account of its (the condition’s) relation to the thing, the causal character does belong to that (thing) also”.—What ‘relation’ can be held to subsist between these two?—It cannot be identity; as the two are recognised as distinct. nor can the relation be held to consist in the fact that it is produced from it; as in that case, there should be simultaneity; and then the appearance of the effects also would be simultaneous
If it be held that there is need for a further auxiliary,—then there would be an infinite regress. from this it follows that, on account of the absence of relation, the effect cannot be produced even once
If the relation between the two (the permanent thing and the conditions) were held to be that of ‘inherence’ (subsistence), then also the following has got to be considered:—Is the ‘inherent’ thing so regarded because it is helpful? Or not so? If the former alternative is accepted, then it comes to be the same as the relation of ‘being produced from it’, and this has just been rejected
In case the ‘inherent’ be not something helpful to that wherein it inheres, then all things would be equally inherent, as there could be nothing to differentiate one from the other
Each of the two alternatives—that the two are different and non-different—having thus been severally rejected, the idea that the condition is both (different and non-different) also becomes discarded
In course of the examination of the ‘pudgala’, etc. it has been explained that both alternatives cannot be accepted. hence the ‘condition’ cannot be both ‘different’ and ‘non-different’; nor can it be neither ‘different’ nor ‘non-different 
Even though the permanent thing may not actually need the auxiliary agencies, yet, apart from these latter, it cannot produce its effect, like the final cause; its own nature is such that it becomes an efficient cause only when in close proximity to the auxiliaries; hence it is that even though the permanent thing is always present, its effect does not come about always.” 
This may be so; but if the character of the permanent thing in its complete form (along with its auxiliaries) be held to be the same as that of it in its incomplete form (without the auxiliaries), then the auxiliaries also should be permanent (eternal)
Because they must exist while that thing exists whose character is connected with them.—If, on the other hand, the incomplete form be held to be different (from the complete form), then the unity of the thing becomes lost.—Thus the successive appearance of effects is not possible, even when the cause is dependent (upon auxiliaries)
412-413) As for simultaneity, that is not favoured (by the other party at all); as the effects are actually found to appear in succession
If the thing possessed of the causal potency disappears, after having brought about all its effects simultaneously,—then its momentariness becomes established
If, on the other hand, the form of the efficient cause continues (after having brought about the effects), then it should produce the effect over again; because, how could any efficiency be attributed to what is not effective in bringing about due effects? Thus all things would be non-existent and momentary,—like the ‘sky-lotus’,—on account of their being devoid of all efficiency; because—it is efficiency (for effective action) that constitutes the characteristic of (existing) ‘things’
If, then, capacity (for fruitful action) be not admitted to be the characteristic feature of the ‘entity’,—then, under the circumstances, it behoves the other party to point out some other characteristic feature of ‘entities’
If the characteristic feature of ‘entities’ be held to consist in being related to existence (being),—that cannot be right; because no such relation as that of ‘inherence’ and the like is known to subsist between them. how too could they be the characteristic feature of one another? 
All operations bearing upon the consideration of things are to be carried on by one who has an undisturbed intellect and seeks to accomplish a useful purpose,—not by one who is demented. hence it would be right to determine the existence of only such a thing as would be of use to some people, at some place, at some time and in some way. it is in reference to such a thing that we are proving the momentariness; and it is only with reference to such things that the universal premiss has been asserted
That which is devoid of all capacity, and is like ‘the son of the barren woman’, never becomes a cause (basis) even for the mind of the omniscient person. and as in such a thing, intelligent men do not perceive an effect or character and so forth, they do not seek to establish its existence; as any such attempt would be absolutely baseless. there can be no useful purpose served by proving the momentariness of such a thing. so that any objection taken to this is also absolutely futile
Such things as the sky-lotus are found to be capable of fruitful activity, in so far as they serve as the cause of their own cognition; and yet these are not existent.” 
The character in question as attributed to the ‘sky-lotus’ is entirely baseless; its idea is there only as the result of one’s eagerness for wrangling
If the said idea had a non-entity for its cause, then it would be produced constantly; as the non-entity cannot need anything else, being always devoid of distinctions
Even if things are momentary,—how can there re any effective action? The initial auxiliaries could not be productive of peculiarities in one another; because if they have come into existence, they must be there already in their complete form; if they have not come into existence, as the entities would not be there, as this absence would be without differentiation, wherefore could not the effect itself be produced therefrom (for the bringing about of which the auxiliaries are posited)? Specially as they could not be differentiated from anything else, being equally open to question. Thus too there would be an infinite regress of auxiliaries for you.—Then again, as they could not have an effective action either successively or simultaneously, it is useless to regard them as ‘momentary’; specially when no peculiarity can be brought about by any auxiliaries, the entire series is rightly held to be wholly undifferentiated (uniform). If then the destruction were without cause, it should come about at the very beginning; and if there be no possibility of it at the beginning, how could it come at the end also?—If again, no cause is admitted except the cause of the entities themselves,—then why should there be any incongruity in their destruction coming about in certain cases only (not always)?” 
Our answer to the above is as follows:—There can be no mutual help in the case of things appearing at the ‘initial stage’; they become auxiliaries only by virtue of having the same effective action. even when there is no help rendered to one another, these are not entirely undifferentiated; because when they are themselves produced out of their own constituent cause, they become productive of their own several distinct ‘series’
Thenceforward the particular entities that come into existence are brought about by that; on account of the fact that those that help towards them are of that nature
Every moment, entities go on coming into existence, with definite undefinable potentialities, and no objection can be taken to them,—just as to the fire’s capacity to burn
It is ‘destruction’ in the shape of the ‘breaking up of the series’ which is without cause; and this does not come about even at the end;—what is denied is its coming into existence in that form. As for the coming into existence of such dissimilar things (series) as the potsherd and the like,—this certainly has a cause; but this also is not produced at the beginning, because at that time its cause is not there
There are two kinds of ‘momentary things’—some are causes of decadence,—e.g. fire is the cause of the decadence (diminution) of cold; and others are not so.—People, not perceiving the truth, think that there is antagonism of various kinds among things, even when the relation of cause and effect is there, as a matter of fact however there is no real ‘antagonism’ among things, in the shape of the relation of the destroyer and destroyed. It is in this sense that the expression ‘notion of antagonism’ has been used
As a matter of fact, there is always the recognition of a thing in the form ‘this is that same’, when the sense-organ concerned is rightly functioning; and this recognition is quite firm and undeniable.—This therefore is an irrepressible fact of perception, which annuls all the reasons that have been adduced for proving the ‘perpetual flux’ of things.” 
In fact, recognition can never be of the nature of direct sense-perception; because the form of the thing itself is inexpressible, and the recognition is expressed in words.—Recognition must be wrong, and sense-perception is entirely different from it. That recognition is wrong is clear from the fact that it appears in the form of the notion of ‘non-difference’ where, in reality, there is difference
If the recognition did apprehend the form of the thing as previously cognised, then it would have appeared at that same time, as its object would be the same,—like the previous cognition
As a matter of fact, however it is not so; then the recognition has not been regarded as apprehending the same object;—because it is produced at its own time,—like the cognition of another thing; and inasmuch as it apprehends as non-different what is really different, it must be mistaken,—like the notion of the illusory ball
It cannot be right to regard recognition as valid,—because it operates towards an object whose purpose has been already accomplished,—like remembrance and such other cognitions;—and hence it is devoid of the character of the valid means (of cognition)
As a matter of fact, the existence of the thing at the present time (of recognition) has not been included under the previous cognition; this is a peculiar feature in recognition, which is not present in remembrance. Remembrance is in the form of ‘that’ and appertains only to that which has been already cognised before; recognition however is in the form ‘this is that same’, which is something totally different (from the previous cognition).” 
Inasmuch as there is no doubt or mistake in regard to what is cognised (by recognition),—recognition acquires the character of the ‘means of right cognition’ after having set aside both.” 
A thing, though cognised by other means of cognition, could be accepted as otherwise, if so apprehended by sense-perception; when however a thing is already taken up by sense-perception, there can be no appearance of any other means of cognition (to the contrary).” 
When a thing has been duly apprehended through the firmly established highest means of cognition,—how could one ever have a cognition to the contrary, on the strength of the other weaker means of cognition?” 
If existence at the present time is held by you to be distinct from the previous existence, then difference between them becomes proved by yourself
If the present existence is not-different (from the previous existence),—then how is it that it is ‘not included in the previous cognition’? In fact, if it were not included therein, then it would come to this that the thing itself was not apprehended at all
If what has been cognised through inference and the other means of cognition were annulled by sense-perception, then inference and the rest could not be regarded as means of right cognition,—because they are annulled,—like cognitions through defective vision
The character of ‘being in accordance with the real state of things’ being equally present in all forms of valid cognition,—why should there be a prejudice at all?—In case the said character be not present in inference and the rest, then these latter would not be valid means of right cognition at all
The all-comprehensive invariable concomitance (premiss) that has been asserted in all the reasonings (propounded by the buddhist) becomes annulled by the following inference; or else, the proposition (asserting the doctrine in question) itself becomes rejected.” 
The subsequent cognition of the sun and other things must appertain to the same sun and other things that exist at the time of the cognition that appears in connection with the sun and moon, etc.,—because while it is not a cognition of anything related to the earth and other things, it is spoken of as the cognition of those things (sun, etc,),—just like the previous cognition of the sun at that time.” 
All those things that are the substrata of colour, etc.,—and the substrata of these things,—as also the cognitions that appear in regard to these,—all these are not, like the sky-lotus, liable to destruction immediately on coming into existence,—because they are cognisable and expressible.” 
Our proclamation is that the cognitions under dispute which appear in succession,—all appertain to one and the same thing,—because the fact of their being based upon one thing is never annulled, and they are all spoken of by the same terms;—just like the cognitions of several men appearing at the present single moment.” 
In the first reasoning, the corroborative instance is devoid of the probandum, as it is all included under the probans; and all objects of cognition are not always synchronous with their cognition
When terms like ‘sun’ and the rest, whose use depends upon the speaker’s whim, are applied to the lamp and such things,—the cognition of the sun that appears proves the falsity of the reason in question
Things like the ‘universal’ have no character at all (being non-existent),—hence the ‘momentariness’ of such things cannot be postulated by anyone; so that any reasons adduced for the proving of the absence of ‘momentariness’ in the said things is entirely futile
As regards the character of ‘being expressed by the same term’—this is present in the cognitions of things like the lamp also. Hence this reason becomes ‘inconclusive’
If it be held that “in the case of the cognitions of the lamp, the ‘co-extensiveness’ is subsequently annulled”,—then how is it that you do not perceive the clear annulment of the same in your proposed conclusion also? 
The cognitions under dispute cannot pertain to one and the same thing, because they appear in succession,—like the cognitions pertaining to lightning, lamp and such things.—In all cognitions pertaining to one and the same thing, the presence of succession is incompatible. and when the effect is the same, even the dependence of other things would be incongruous
All these reasons are free from doubt and denial;—as no proofs have been adduced in annulment of these
All these reasons are free from doubt and denial;—as no proofs have been adduced in annulment of these
If all things are obsessed by non-permanence, in the form of ‘momentariness’, then how can there be any relation between action and its result (reaction), or between the cause and its effect and so forth?” 
If all things are obsessed by non-permanence, in the form of ‘momentariness’, then how can there be any relation between action and its result (reaction), or between the cause and its effect and so forth?” 
In the case of active people, that ‘moment’ (momentary thing) which is believed to be the doer of the act, does not continue to exist at the time of the appearance of the result of that act;—and the act was not done by that ‘moment’ which is spoken of as the experiencer of the result at the time of its appearance; as it did not exist at that time.—Thus, inasmuch as no single entity is admitted as being the doer of the act and the experiencer of its results,—the position thus clearly is that the act is lost for the man who did it and its results befall one who did not do it,—which is extremely anomalous.” 
As a matter of fact, under the doctrine of ‘no-soul’, the doer of an act would know, beforehand, that, ‘as i am going to perish immediately, there would be no result from this act, or it would come to some one other than myself’; and knowing this, the intelligent man would not undertake the performance of any act, good or bad, for the purpose of securing its result; as for the result, it would be still further removed.” 
Neither the future nor the past entity can be capable of producing the effect; as for the present one, that also does not continue to exist till that time.” 
An entity that has itself not secured its existence can never re the cause of something else; nor can the destroyed entity (be a cause); nor can the presence (of the present entity) be capable of producing the effect.—Further, if the destruction of the previous ‘moment’ be held to be absolute, then there could be no production of any subsequent ‘moment’, as its cause would not be there.” 
Even if the destruction and production were simultaneous, there would not be mutual dependence; so that there could not be the relation of ‘cause and effect’, as there would be no help rendered by it.” 
The odour and other qualities that appear after the destruction of the colour of the jar are not held to be the effect of this latter; in the same way the subsequent colours also (could not be regarded as the effect of the previous colour).” 
Thus that alone can be regarded as the cause of an effect whose action is found to be there before the production of that effect; and not mere immediate sequence.” 
The upshot briefly is this:—If the effect were produced from a cause that has perished, then such an effect would be without cause,—as what has perished can have no character (or potentiality).—If the effect be held to be produced from a cause that has not perished,—then, as the cause in that case would continue to exist during several moments,—wherefore could the ‘momentary character’ of things not become discarded (on that account)?” 
If the jar and such things existed only for one moment, then they could not be perceived by the eye; as things that have been destroyed are never cognised,—as is found in the case op things long past.—The relation op ‘cause and effect’ cannot be apprehended by means op ‘perception and non-apprehension’, because the nature of things is not apprehended at all”
What permanent doer (agent) is there who would correlate the cognitions appearing in succession? If any such were seen, then alone what is desired could be admitted; and if any such is not seen, then this latter cannot be understood.” 
Things are in ‘perpetual flux then recognition also is impossible; because what has been seen by one person cannot be ‘recognised’ by others.” 
In the case of the hairs and other things, where there is difference, recognition may be due to similarity, because the perceiver is one and the same. when however there is difference of both, there would be no basis for recognition. if there is no single entity who could have the comprehensive notion, then how is it that, on seeing colour, there appears a longing for the taste and other qualities (of the thing seen)?”
What is bound up with chains of attachment, etc. in the prison-house of the world is one ‘moment’, while the ‘moment’ that is liberated is another, who has not been in bondage;—this is incomprehensible.” 
For the bound (imprisoned) person, liberation can never be possible; because (ex hypothesi), he is absolutely destroyed. Hence all the effort put forth by persons seeking for liberation is futile.” 
The person securing liberation has always been found to be one who has been bound up in chains, etc.; any such assertion therefore as that ‘the unbound person becomes liberated’ is contrary to a well-perceived fact.” 
Bondage’ and ‘liberation’ must belong to the same person,—because they are of that nature,—like bondage and liberation in the ordinary world.—Thus everything becomes thoroughly well-established.” 
In this same manner it may be shown that, if all things are in ‘perpetual flux’, remembrance and such other phenomena would be impossible,—as there would be no single substratum (under that theory).” 
We proceed to answer the above criticisms as follows:—Things being without ‘soul’, in reference to these also, the relation of cause and effect being there, all the said notions become established without any difficulty
Just as the potency of the seed is restricted to the sprout even in the absence of a permanent ‘soul’,—so would it also be in the case of psychical concepts
Either indirectly or directly, it is only a certain thing,—and in only certain gases—that has the potentiality in regard to another thing; thus alone are such relations as that between actions and their results possible
The notion of the ‘doer’ and the rest is in reference to the unity of the ‘chain’; and that too is held to be only a figment of the imagination; it is not a fart of the real state of things
In the absence of continuity, the relation of ‘cause and effect’ would be of the particular hind just pointed out,—this alone is possible among things appearing under different ‘chains’.—In the case of the seed, sprout and such things, the relation of cause and effect is found to be definitely certain, and yet there is not the slightest trace of continuity
If the elements of earth and the rest in the seed—sprout—creeper and so forth are not different,—then there can be no difference among them; as, in that case, all of them would be of the same nature. hence it must be admitted that there is no continuity in this case. For these reasons, for the purpose of establishing the existence of ‘action and re-action’, the superior philosophers should put forth an effort to prove the relation of ‘cause and effect’;—and for the purpose of establishing the non-existence of ‘action and reaction’, the other philosophers should put forth an effort to disprove the relation of ‘cause and effect’
Our explanation is as follows:—The effect gomes into existence at the second moment;—the cause had come into existence at the first moment; and during that moment it is not destroyed. but being momentary, it does not exist at the moment at which the effect is there; even if it were there, it would be useless, as the effect will have already come into existence
What has already come into existence cannot be produced by it over again; because what is meant by a thing ‘coming into existence’ is that there should comb about something that did not exist before. If it were not so, then there would be no resting at all
Thus we conclude that it is at the second moment that the effect comes into existence out of an efficient cause which came into existence at the first moment and has not yet been destroyed.—If it had been held that the effect comes into existence at the third moment, then it would come out of the destroyed cause; as the cause of the development will have been destroyed, like the effect itself,—as is going to be explained later on.—There would be simultaneity only if the effect had come at the first moment. but this cannot be right,—being just like the doctrine of the effects coming into existence along with the cause
What did not exist could have no potency;—if the potency were there, the effect would surely be produced; hence simultaneity between cause and effect is clearly incongruous
As a matter of fact, when the cause produces its effect, it does hot do so by holding the effect in the manner of the pair of tongs,—by reason of which there would be simultaneity between the two, nor does the effect come into existence, by firmly embracing its cause, in the manner of the lover embracing the beloved,—by reason of which the two could be regarded as coming into existence at one and the same time
Though the thing is really inactive, yet on account of the restriction imposed by the nature of its cause which came into existence at the first moment, there appears, immediately afterwards, something coming into contact with the second moment; it is under these circumstances that the former is said to produce the latter;—such assertion being in accordance with a convention which is purely arbitrary, based upon the whim of the speaker
What would be the good of any activity at any time other than that of its own birth? Mere existence is the only operation, as it is when this is there that the effect appears
It is the necessary condition of ‘immediate sequence’ that is called ‘need’; and in the appearance of the effect, the only operation of the cause in all cases is its ‘existence’
As a matter of fact, the operation also is assumed to be the cause only on the basis of the fact that the effect appears when the operation is there; it is far better, then, that the thing itself to which that operation belongs should be regarded as the cause
As a matter of fact, it is on the existence of the seed itself that the sprout is seen to appear; on the other hand, nothing is seen as coming into existence on the existence of an ‘operation’
If you assume the ‘causal character’ of the operation when its potency (towards the effect) has not been perceived,—then why do you not assume the same of something else also? Or, what distinguishing feature do you find in the ‘operation’ which is not found in that other thing? 
Just as the ‘operation’, without any other (operation), is held to be the cause of the effect,—in the same way, why cannot others, like it, be causes? 
is missing in the printed text; the commentary upon it however is available, as follows]:— 
Though it has been regarded as perceptible, yet we do not perceive it; how then can we accept the connection op that as the basis (op the causal character)? 
In the case of cognition, its coming into existence itself has been described as constituting its character of ‘means of right cognition’; why then should not the causal character in the case of all things be held to be the same? 
Just as cognition is momentary, so are all things that are born, as they have been proved to be. Hence the whole universe must be devoid of ‘operation’
As regards odour and other qualities (appearing in the jar), the fact of their being causes of each other, as forming factors of the same ‘chain’, is actually admitted (by us); and this idea is not annulled by the alleged anomaly of their being such causes
Even when one thing appears in immediate sequence to another,—it is only in some oases (not always) that the latter is the cause of the former, where the sequence is invariable; this is what is accepted, in view of such being the real state of things;—the same is the case under the view that things are permanent
If a thing that is active towards the producing of an effect is not to be regarded as the cause of this latter, [what then?]”—Then let that be accepted as the ‘cause’ of a thing whose presence is always essential for the appearance of this latter
As a matter of fact, the existence and non-existence (of things) are always known through perception and non-apprehension (respectively),—if the view held is that the things are apprehended by cognitions with forms.—If, on the other hand, you hold that the thing is apprehended by a cognition which is formless,—then the same is found to be the case under the doctrine of things being momentary. Because whenever cognition is produced by its antecedent causes, it is always in the form of an apprehension having the same colour, etc. that happen to appear at the time
If cognition has a form, then consciousness would be of variegated form. if, on the other hand, it is not marked by any form, there can be no basis in the form of proximity (for specifying the cognition).” 
You also have to supply some explanation in answer to the above; and whatever answer you put forward would also be our answer to it
There would be ‘waste of what is done’, only if the cause did not produce an effect no such view however is held by us, whereby there could be no ‘causal character’.—The ‘befalling of what is not done’ also would be there if an effect were produced without a cause; this also is not held by us; as the production of the effect is always dependent upon the potency of a particular cause
What is urged against us, by setting forth the alternative of things being different every moment, is the fact of everything undergoing destruction at every moment and so forth. But by urging all this the other party have not put forward anything that is disagreeable to us
The assumptions based upon the difference among moments do not arise in persons the powers of whose vision have been damaged,—because of their idea of the unity of the ‘chain’. In fact, persons who have fully realised the truth understand the limitations of the causes appearing in a ‘perpetual flux’, and undertake the performance of good deeds accordingly
The peculiar character of ‘cause and effect’ is restricted to some minds only; that is how remembrance, etc. come about without obstruction
Ignorance and the rest, in the form of ‘cause and effect’, are held to constitute ‘bondage’, and the cessation of these, as consisting in the purity of the mind, is held to constitute ‘liberation’
Even in the ordinary world, these two—‘bondage’ and ‘liberation’—are not admitted as appearing in the same substratum; as everything is held to be momentary
As the coming in of any peculiarity is entirely impossible, all notions of the ‘doer and the experienced,’, ‘being in bondage’ and so forth,—in regard to the soul—must be incompatible; or else the soul is something evanescent
As the coming in of any peculiarity is entirely impossible, all notions of the ‘doer and the experienced,’, ‘being in bondage’ and so forth,—in regard to the soul—must be incompatible; or else the soul is something evanescent
The followers of Akṣapāda (Gautama, naiyāyikas) and of Kaṇāda (vaiśeṣikas) have asserted, solely on the strength of verbal authority, that—“the theory of the universal and such things being formless, set forth previously—cannot be right; because the six categories of ‘sub stance’ and the rest do really exist”.—Hence the refutation of these, substance and the rest, is briefly set forth here
The followers of Akṣapāda (Gautama, naiyāyikas) and of Kaṇāda (vaiśeṣikas) have asserted, solely on the strength of verbal authority, that—“the theory of the universal and such things being formless, set forth previously—cannot be right; because the six categories of ‘sub stance’ and the rest do really exist”.—Hence the refutation of these, substance and the rest, is briefly set forth here
Substance has been held to be of nine kinds—divided under the different heads of ‘earth’ and the rest; of these, the four beginning with the ‘earth’ are of two kinds—eternal and non-eternal
The ‘atoms’ that have been held to be of the nature of ‘earth’ and the rest are eternal; while those made up of the atom and the rest are evanescent
Among these, the non-existence of the eternal (permanent) atoms has already been proved, by establishing the fact of all things being in a state of ‘perpetual flux’
If atoms were permanent, then all gross substances would be produced at once; as they are equally independent of conjunction and other conditions
If the producer of atoms is not held to be endowed with the property of existence, on the ground that it does not form the objective of any means of cognising existent things,—[then the answer is as explained in the following text]
The reason adduced cannot be right; because it is inadmissible; as the cause of atoms is actually perceived in the shape of the weaver and the like; inasmuch as the cloth and other things are all constituted of atoms
It may be that the existence of a thing cannot be known in the absence of a means of the right cognition of the existing thing. But the mere absence of the means of right cognition cannot bring about certainty regarding its being actually nonexistent
The composite substance made up of atoms,—as distinct from qualities and components,—is never apprehended; hence, there being no evidence for it, it cannot be admitted
As a matter of fact, the rock-crystal is actually perceived when in contact with another thing, even though its quality is not perceived;—similarly the line of cranes and such things are also seen;—when the man is covered by a long cloak, even though his complexion, etc. are not perceived, there is perception of him as a ‘man’;—in the case of the red cloth, there is perception of it as ‘cloth’.” 
A) Colour and other qualities are entirely different from the lotus and other things,—because they are distinguished by these (latter)—just as the horse is distinguished by caitra (the rider)
B) Or, the earth and other substances are entirely different from colour, odour and other qualities because they are differently spoken of by means of words in the singular and plural numbers (respectively),—just as the ‘moon’ (singular) and the ‘stars’ (plural) are different.” 
Similarly, the yarns and the cloth must be regarded as different,—because they have different makers and different potencies,—just as the pillar and the jar are regarded as different because of the presence of contradictory properties.” 
If there were no gross substances, then the perception of the tree and such things would not be possible; because the atoms are beyond the reach of the senses; nor would the term ‘atom’ (small) be possible; because it is the extremely subtle thing that is so spoken of in relation to a gross substance; hence in the absence of the gross substance, in relation to what would its ‘subtlety’ be?” 
In the case op the rock-crystal (cited above), the rock-crystal is perceived as red in colour; and yet, in reality, it cannot be red;—as that would demolish your own theory
Apart prom the colour, nothing else is perceived op the nature op something different; and it cannot be right,—even for you—that things should be apprehended by the cognition op something different; as that would lead to an absurdity
It might be possible too in that case, that it is the white colour (of the rock-crystal) itself that is actually cognised; but such a cognition would be clearly wrong,—like the cognition of the conch being yellow
The cognition that appears in the case of the man covered by the cloak is inferential, and does not appertain to the man at all; because what is really cognised in this case is the cloak having the shape due to the man
As a matter of fact, such things as the red dye and the saffron produce a new colour in the cloth, on the destruction of the previous colour; because the cloth itself is momentary (and its previous colour has perished along with it)
What happens is that out of one colour (red) another white colour is produced through the intervention of water and such other things;—just like the black colour of metals
If the colour had remained in the same condition, then there could be no suppression of it; as the previous unsuppressed colour would continue to exist
The diverse ways of verbal expression wherein the genitive and different numbers are used proceed entirely from the speaker’s whim; hence it is not right to determine the real state of things on the basis of such expressions
Further, the other party do not regard the ‘existence’ of the six categories as anything different; nor is any single ‘group’ of them admitted
If it be said that—“the existence of the six categories is held to be the property subsisting in what is an object made known by a means of right cognition”,—then, in that case, this would have to be distinct from the six that you postulate
The six that have been postulated are things with properties, and the properties are certainly admitted by us to be distinct from them.”—If this is said (by the other party), then (we ask)—what is the relation that is held to subsist between the categories and the properties? This relation cannot be that of ‘conjunction’, as this is restricted to substances alone (under the nyāya-view); nor is the other relation, that of ‘inherence’, possible; and no other relation is accepted by the other party
If no relation is possible, then how could the property belong to the categories?—If it were held to belong to them merely on the ground of its being produced by them, then there would be others also like it
Further, as there would be ‘existence’ of the existence also, the incompatible (genitive) ending would be incompatible with it; and if there were existence of that existence also, and so forth, there would be no end to it
Thus in all these ‘existences’, the character of ‘being with property’ would be due to the presence therein of another property; and in the case of substance and the rest also, the character of ‘being with property’ has been accepted on the same basis
If it is the difference of the cloth from the very first yarns that is sought to be proved,—then there is the irresistible defect of ‘futility’. those other yarns also that appear later on, in another state (form), capable of a particular kind of useful action,—are not entirely different in character from those first yarns
The intention being to indicate their use in the accomplishment of a single purpose,—if each yarn were spoken of separately, then there would be the defects of (a) prolixity, (b) incapacity, and (c) futility with a view to avoid these, thinking that there would be simplicity of usage if all the yarns were mentioned by a single name, people making use of words have brought forth the single term and applied it to the yarns,—but these (yarns) do not serve to prove the cloth, which is synchronous with those yarns, as having a different maker and different potencies and different size
As a matter of fact, those atoms that have come into existence as mutually helpful,—are not beyond the senses; as they are within reach of the senses
The ‘blue’ and other shapes have been postulated in regard to the atoms themselves; and the visual and other cognitions also serve to manifest only those blue and other shapes
Though they are not perceived in the sequential form,—yet their perceptibility cannot be denied,—it being similar to that of drinks and other things
As a matter of fact, in the matter of the perception of all things,—which exist only in the form of mutual exclusion (negation),—there is the same uncertainty in regard to all their characters and forms
Even though, the thing being impartite, its character is apprehensible only by indeterminate perception, yet there is definite (certain) cognition of its differentiation (from other things); and it is this definite cognition that is understood to be the cause (of certainty)
Just as in the case of the lamp it is only a series of similar flames which brings about the illusion (of its being one); so [in the case of the mountain also], there is an illusion of unity, even though what are really cognised are several subtle entities appearing in close juxtaposition
If the perceptibility of atoms is not admitted because of their being not-differentiated, then how is it seen in the case of the lamp and such things? or, is the composite held to be of that kind? 
All, that can be urged is—“on the definite cognition of these (atoms), how is it that it is not realised that what is perceived as blue is the form of the atoms?”—But that also cannot be the cause; because the cognition in question cannot be without an object; and yet it cannot have for its object a single gross object, as there is incompatibility between grossness and one-ness
If the gross object were op the nature of one only, then on even part op it being covered by the little leg op a plea, all of it would become covered, without any distinction;—and on one part op it being reddened, all of it would become coloured red.—Or, on the contrary, the presence op incompatible properties would indicate multiplicity
Inasmuch as the object is of one uniform character, to what would the use of the term ‘sarva’ (‘all’) be due? Because that term denotes more than one individual thing, while the composite is not of the nature of many individuals.” 
It is only such things as are well known in the world,—such as cloth, body, mountain and so forth,—that have been mentioned by you as ‘composites’;—and as a matter of fact, all men make use of such expressions as ‘the cloth is red—all of it—whole of it—in its totality—completely’,—entirely on the basis of their whim.—Thus the use of verbal expressions being dependent upon the whim of the speaker, we also make use of the expression ‘all of the object would be reddened’; because there can be no check upon speakers
If the name be said to be figurative (indirect), then there should be difference in number. there is also no difference in the cognition, which is admitted by both (though directly and indirectly)
Inasmuch as conjunction is not all-embracing in its character, the colouring cannot belong to all the cloth; nor is the whole found to be covered.” 
When the substance has no parts, what form would be there that would not be embraced (by the conjunction)? If such an (unembraced) form of the substance remained there, then diversity becomes established.—Existence in several places is not possible for any single object. hence it becomes established that things like the cloth are different in form from the atoms (composing them)
It is only people who have not understood the real nature of things that conceive of ‘one mass’; and it is on the basis of this assumption that the term ‘atom’ is used
Or, the name ‘atom’, as applied to what has been described, may be taken as baseless, dependent upon mere convention; just as the name ‘lord’ is applied to one who has no property at all
A) such things as the yarns and the hand and other limbs cannot be permeated by any single ‘composite’,—because they are more than one,—like such well-known things as straw, hut and jar.—or (B)—the substance in question cannot subsist in several components,—because it is one,—like the atom.—And (C) impossibility of subsistence would be the proof annulling the other party’s proposition
If the composite subsisted in the components] it could subsist in one component, either exactly in the form in which it subsists in another component, or in some other form. No third way is possible.—It is not possible for it to subsist in one exactly in the form in which it subsists in another; because it is already embraced within its fold by the latter. If it were not so, then it would not be subsisting in that either
Just as the baby does not occupy the lap of a second nurse,—so a substance embraced in one could not subsist in another (component)
If the composite essentially related to one component subsisted in some other component occupying a place other than that of the said component,—then it would mean that the two components occupy the same place and are essentially one and the same, because they are not differentiated if, on the other hand, the composite subsisted in the other component in another form,—then as occupying two places, the composite could not be one; specially as difference in form (and character) must constitute difference in the thing itself
If it be held that the subsistence of the composite in the components is of the nature of ‘inherence’—then the same considerations as above follow that idea also with equal force
Or again, if it (the composite) subsists (in the component) in its entirety,—then it becomes liable to being regarded as many; as for its subsistence in part, that is not what is held (by the other party); and the composite would (in that case) not be one; and it would not subsist anywhere at all
Whenever a reason is adduced,—either directly or in the form of a reductio ad absurdum,—it becomes truly applicable only when it is itself apprehended;—not otherwise.—As a matter of fact, subsistence either in whole or in part has never been perceived (by you, buddhists),—on the basis of the impossibility of which in the substance, the substance could be held to be non-existent, or something else—if, on the other hand, such subsistence has been perceived by you anywhere, then it cannot be denied in the case of the substance and such things.—If the said subsistence has not been perceived, then the question does not arise regarding the distinction; all that could be asserted would be that ‘the subsistence is not there’, and this would not be right; as it is something directly perceived; as is clear in such notions as ‘this subsists here’.—If it be held that ‘the fact of this being direct perception is not admitted’, then some annulling reasoning should be put forward. Otherwise, even such cognitions as those of colour and such things might cease to be of the nature of ‘perception’.” 
That ‘the subsistence is not there’ has already been established above, in a general way. As for the notion that ‘it subsists herein’, there is no such cognition at all; as this exact form does not appear in any cognition
What is meant by (the question containing) the terms ‘in entirety’ and ‘in part’ is—does the substance subsist as an impartite whole,—in the way in which the bilva-fruit lies in a dish? Or does it subsist in some other way—as a certain person, caitra, does when lying down on several seats? 
Sounds must subsist in something,—because of their perishability and such other characters; like the jar, the lamp-flame and such things;—and this something must be ākāśa”
The notion of priority, posteriority and so forth must have for its basis something other than mobile substances like the sun,—like the notion of the jar and such things,—because it is entirely different in character from the notion of wrinkles, grey hairs, emaciation and so forth;—and it is this basis, cause, which is held to be ‘time’.” 
Similarly space is inferred from such notions as ‘fore’ and ‘aft’.”a) “The mind has been held to be inferred from the successive appearance of cognitions; which requires a cause different from the eye and other sense-organs. as a matter of fact, the cognitions of colour and such things appear successively,—like the chariot and such things.”b-626) 
Inasmuch as sound is already accepted as having its cause in the ‘great elements’ that have been acknowledged (or not-acknowledged),—it is already admitted that sounds subsist in those elements. So that the first reason put forward (for the existence of ākāśa) cannot prove (what it is meant to prove)
The subsistence of sounds in ākāśa,—which is one, all-pervading and eternal,—cannot be proved (by the reason adduced),—because it is devoid of ‘positive concomitance’;—and also because there would be absence of succession and so forth; as also universal contact
The notions of ‘priority and posteriority’ (and of ‘fore and aft’) are based upon a conception arising out of particular conventions; they are not due to ‘time’, nor to ‘space’. Inasmuch as these are impartite, one, ‘priority’, ‘posteriority’ and the like are not possible in them. If the notions be said to be based upon the things related to them, then they themselves become useless
Mind’ as distinct from the ‘eye’, etc. is admitted by its also; that idea being regarded as ‘mind’ which appears immediately after the six (cognitions).—If however the mind is regarded as permanent, then there comes the anomaly of cognitions being simultaneous; thus the reason put forward by you becomes destructive of what is desired
I think that the sūtra (nyāya-sūtra 1.1.36) has been composed for the purpose of proving and disproving the mind as postulated by the Buddha, and the other philosopher (respectively),—and hence it has been repeated with an additional ‘a’ (‘not’)
I think that the sūtra (nyāya-sūtra 1.1.36) has been composed for the purpose of proving and disproving the mind as postulated by the Buddha, and the other philosopher (respectively),—and hence it has been repeated with an additional ‘a’ (‘not’)
By the rejection of ‘substance’, ‘quality ‘action’ and the rest, which are held to be subsistent in substance, all become discarded
By the rejection of ‘substance’, ‘quality ‘action’ and the rest, which are held to be subsistent in substance, all become discarded
The ‘relative’ (wherein the relation could subsist) having been discarded, whose ‘subsistence’ would it be? and where? still a detailed denial of each (category) is going to be set forth
If in a large substance, the blue colour is held to be one only,—then how is it that there is no manifestation and perception of it when it is seen in light coming through an aperture? 
The blue colour is hot held to exist in well-defined parts; hence what is manifested then by that (light) must, on that account, vary with each atom
Number’, which is held to be perceptible, does not appear in cognition as anything distinct from such names as ‘the elephant’, etc. which connote ‘negation op the contrary’ hence it must be nonexistent
As in cognition, so in things like the jar also, the notion of ‘one’ and the rest is one that follows only from an imaginary convention set up by a mere whim.—there can be no differentiating number in these (cognitions), because they are not ‘substance—nor can the notion be said to be ‘figurative’, as it is not found to be fallible
The notion of one in regard to cognitions is assumed on the basis of the one-ness subsisting in that same substance, on account of their subsisting in the same thing”,—if this is asserted [then the answer is as in the following text]
The number ‘one’ may subsist in the one cognition; but on what basis does the notion of ‘two’ proceed, in reference to cognitions? Or even in regard to the ‘six categories’ and the rest?—The notion too of its ‘subsisting in the same thing’ can only be figurative, and hence fallible,—like the notion of ‘fire’ in regard to the boy
The notion of number is established on the basis of its being different from the notion of the ‘elephant’ and other things; the said notion (of number) must arise from things other than those,—just like the notion of the ‘blue cloth’ and the like.” commentary. 
What is desired to be proved could be proved as being due to such causes as an imaginary convention arising from mere whim and so forth. The existence of ‘number’ in cognition and other things also may be due to the same cause
If the accomplishment of the number be explained as dependent upon cognitions,—then, why cannot the notion be accepted as due to mere convention? 
Dimension’ has been classed as ‘large ‘long’ and the like;—why cannot it be regarded as due to diversity of forms in the thing itself? 
A line of mansions is conceived of as ‘large’; and yet no ‘dimension’ commensurate with the form of the line is assumed. If it be said that it is spoken of as such on the basis of the quality subsisting in the same object (mansion),—then the answer is that neither ‘largeness’ nor ‘length’ is ever meant to belong to mansions
The ‘palace’ is held by you to be a ‘conglomeration’, which is a quality; which, as such, cannot have dimension (which is another quality); nor can there be another ‘line’ of it. Nor can recourse be had to figurative expression
The notion of ‘being apart’, which is assumed as being due to the quality of ‘separateness’,—why has it not been held to rest in the various things of divergent characters? 
Just as cognition, pleasure and the rest, being different from one another, are spoken of as ‘separate’, and hence become the basis of that notion (of separateness), independently of anything else,—so would other things also
Conjunction and disjunction as restricted to substances have been postulated by others as causes of the notions of ‘being joined’ and the like; these are entirely useless
If there were no conjunction, then the soil, the seed, the water and the earth and such things should be always producing their effects; as there would be no ground for differentiation.—As a matter of fact however, the soil, the seed, the water and such things are always found to require something else in the producing of their effects;—like the stick, the wheel and water, etc. (in the making of jar). That thing which they require is conjunction; and as it has a particular characteristic, it is regarded as distinct (from other things). when one is told to ‘bring two conjoined things’, he brings only those two things in which he perceives the conjunction, avoiding everything else.” 
If conjunction and disjunction were not there, then to what would such distinct notions be due as—‘this thing is attached to it’—‘this is detached from it’?” 
It sometimes happens that even when one thing is really detached from another, it is perceived as attached to it,—and when the thing is really close to another, it is perceived as detached from it;—there are these two misconceptions. and a misconception has always some primary factor as its counterpart. this primary factor has to be pointed out in the two misconceptions cited. if such a primary factor is asserted, conjunction and disjunction become established.” 
Then again, on what basis is the notion of ‘the man with earrings’ produced? It could not proceed from the mere presence of the man and the ear-ring; for in that case, the said notion would be there always.—Further, it is only something that has been perceived to be present in one place that is denied in another place. If conjunction has not been perceived, then how does it come to be denied in such expressions as ‘caitra is without ear-rings’? Hence it follows that there is some such real thing in the shape of conjunction, whose affirmation and denial proceed with due distinction.” 
The answer to the above is as follows:—The water and the rest do not remain the same, as all things are momentary.—Even when existent, they stand in need of that condition in which there is nothing intervening between them
If the water, etc. needed the conjunction only, then they would appear immediately on their coming together (conjunction),—or not appear at all
When a man sees two things having come close together by themselves, he brings those things in that condition (when told to do so)
When a thing is produced in the detached form, it becomes the basis for the notion op being ‘detached’; on the other hand, when it is produced in the attached form, it becomes the basis of the notion of being ‘attached’;—just as in the case of the house, the vindhya mountain and the himalaya mountain
A misconception does not appear always in accordance with a primary conception; for instance, the notion of ‘two moons’ appears independently of its similarity to any other (primary) notion, through some internal derangement, while the mind is turned elsewhere.—Or, the requisite ‘primary’ in the case in question may be that same thing which has been produced in the attached form and the like (but is misconceived as being detached or otherwise)
The notion of ‘the man with the ear-ring’ arises only with reference to caitra (the man) and the ear-ring, in whom a particular condition has come about; and it only appears as if the cognition were of ‘conjunction’ (between the two)
670) commentary. 
It is the one peculiar condition seen in one place which is denied in another place.—as regards the notion ‘caitra is without the ear-ring’, it is not conjunction that is denied; for the simple reason that this conjunction has never been seen
The notion of things being ‘conjunct’ cannot be due to the conjunction postulated by the other party,a) because it is the notion op ‘being conjunct’,—like the notion op ‘being conjunct’ in connection with the mansion and such things;—or (b) because it appears only when there is more than one thing,—like the cognitions op several differentiated yarns.—The same two arguments may be urged mutatis mutandis, against disjunction also.—And the reason annulling (both these conceptions op conjunction and disjunction) consists in the pact that it cannot be right for one thing to subsist in more things than one
The name (and idea) of ‘priority’ and ‘posteriority’ have been assumed as the basis of the notions of ‘fore’ and ‘aft’,—as these notions cannot be determined in reference to space and time.—But just as the blue and other colours, which come into existence in succession (one after the other), come to be spoken of ‘fore’ and ‘aft’, without reference to distinctions due to any other conditions,—so would the said notions be in regard to other things also
If it be held that—“number, conjunction and the rest cannot be non-different from substance, because they serve to characterise and differentiate this latter,—like the stick”,—then [our answer is that] there is proving of what is admitted by us, if what is meant is that they have an ‘illusory existence’; because what is ‘imaginary’ cannot be defined either as ‘this’ or ‘not this 
If the fact of the ‘group’ and such things being undefinable is denied (by the opponent) on the ground that they have distinctive features,—just like colour, sound, taste and other things,—[then our answer is as given in the next text]
In reality, the ‘group’ is absolutely feature-less; hence, like the ‘sky-lotus’, it can have no specific properties; they are all figments of imagination.—Even when stated in this form, the reasoning adduced would be ‘fallible’, in view of things like the ‘sky-lotus in fact, ‘non-difference’ as well as ‘difference’ rests always in an object
Thus then, if what is meant to be asserted is that number and the rest are other than (different from) substance,—then the reason becomes open to the fallacy of ‘having no substratum’,—because number and the rest are not admitted at all
If it is substance itself, as diversified through ‘group’, etc., that is spoken of as such,—then what the argument would prove would be the difference of substance from itself—thus involving self-contradiction
Momentum has been described as being of three kinds—named ‘vega’, velocity,—‘bhāvanā’, impression,—and ‘sthitasthāpaka’, ‘elasticity’.—all this however is not compatible because things being momentary, there can be no action in them, of the continuity of which the momentum named ‘velocity’ could be the cause
The momentum called ‘impression’ is of the nature of an impress on the mind. it cannot be a quality of the soul; because this has been rejected
There can be no such quality as ‘elasticity’, because things are in a ‘perpetual flux’, and hence nothing can be lasting (sthita); if there were any such thing, it should continue to exist in that same form
The momentary existence of a thing consists merely in its being produced from its cause; and the ‘continuity in the chain’ also (of every succeeding thing) is due to being produced from each preceding thing
What is not-momentary] does not appear in any other form;—of what then could the momentum be the ‘establisher’?—Nor has this momentum been found to have causal character; the cause then may consist of this momentum or something else. Further, the momentum in question has been held to be a quality that re-establishes what has been already produced,—such for example, as the cloth.—What therefore has been called a ‘quality’ and ‘momentum’ is not possible
Mind, mind’s contact and the soul having been previously discarded,—there can be no ‘unseen force’ of the kinds postulated by the other party
Mind, mind’s contact and the soul having been previously discarded,—there can be no ‘unseen force’ of the kinds postulated by the other party
In things that are in a ‘perpetual flux’, any action, in the shape of ‘throwing up’ and the like, is impossible; because it ceases at the very place where it is born, and hence it cannot get at any other place
In things that are in a ‘perpetual flux’, any action, in the shape of ‘throwing up’ and the like, is impossible; because it ceases at the very place where it is born, and hence it cannot get at any other place
The other party also have asserted that the time of action is subsequent to the time of the birth of the object,—even in such things as the lamp-flame, which are admitted (by him also) to be fleeting in their character
At the first moment) there is contact with the cause, (2) then the appearance of the generic character,—then (3) some commotion in the parts of the object,—then (4) the disruption of the parts,—then (5) the destruction of the contact,—then (6) the destruction of the object;—in this way, even in the case of the lamp-flame and such things, what has been held is that they last for six moments only
It is only when there is separation from the posterior spot, and contact with the frontal spot, that the object may be assumed to be ‘going’ (‘in motion’), or to be the substratum of any other action. when the mobile person does not last even for a moment,—even though such a person be extremely small, there is no possibility of passing over to another spot removed by the minutest point
In case the object is something lasting, ‘going’ and the rest are all impossible; because such an object should remain the same under all conditions, 
If the action of going and the rest constituted the very essence of the ‘moving entity’,—then, this latter could not stay immobile for even a single moment; because even when the going, etc. are not there, they should certainly be there,—inasmuch as the object has not renounced its previous form, and is exactly as it was at the time of the appearance of the going, etc
If, on the other hand, the objects were, by their nature, of the nature of the ‘immobile entity’,—then absence of going should be there always, and there would be no movement of any kind even for a moment. because, even when going might be there, the object would still be of the nature of the ‘immobile entity’,—because it will not have renounced its previous nature,—just as at the time when it was not moving
If the object were mobile at one time and immobile at another then, inasmuch as two mutually different characters would be there, it would be two different objects
It is clearly seen that the two are entirely different; because of the presence of contradictory properties:—like two things of which one is moving and another not moving
The action that is regarded as visible is nothing different from the object. even such existence of it as would be compatible with reason, is never actually perceived
Thus ‘going’ and the rest are impossible either in permanent or impermanent things; because it is not possible for them either to be separated from their former place, or to get at another place
The notion of ‘going’ is an illusion,—as in the lamp-flame,—due to the appearance of different but similar things being found consecutively in diverse places
The notion of ‘going’ is an illusion,—as in the lamp-flame,—due to the appearance of different but similar things being found consecutively in diverse places
Substance’ and other categories having been rejected, the ‘universals’ also have become rejected; as they have all been assumed to subsist in the three categories
Substance’ and other categories having been rejected, the ‘universals’ also have become rejected; as they have all been assumed to subsist in the three categories
The ‘universal’ is postulated by the other party in the following manner: “it is of two kinds—‘being’ is a ‘universal’ which is ‘universal’ only,—as it pervades over all things; ‘substance’ and the rest, while being ‘universals are also spoken of as ‘particulars’; because in regard to their own substrata, they become the cause of their comprehensive notion, and also serve to differentiate their substrata from all things belonging to other ‘universals’—and in this way they also become the cause of the exclusive notion of those substrata.” 
There are some ‘particulars’ which serve as the basis of ‘exclusion’ only; these have been described as ‘ultimate individualities subsisting in eternal substances 
Inasmuch as it is on the strength of these that mystics have the notions,—in connection with the atom and other eternal substances,—that ‘this is different from that’,—these are regarded as subsisting in each of these sub stances.” 
Such ‘universals’ (communities, genuses) as ‘being’, ‘cow’ and the like are vouched for by direct perception; as the notion of ‘being’ and the rest are found to appear only when the sense-organs are functioning.” 
The existence of these is cognised by means of inference also: a distinctive notion must be due to a different cause.” 
a) “In regard to the cow and the elephant, the peculiarities of name—‘cow’ and ‘elephant’,—and ideas—must be due to causes other than convention, shape, body, etc.,—because while appertaining to the cow and the elephant, they are different from the names and ideas of these latter;—just like the names and ideas ‘with calf’ and ‘with the goad’ (respectively) as applied to the same cow and elephant. The qualifying clause has been added for the purpose of excluding the ‘hare’s horns’ and such other non-entities. The name and idea of the other things are the corroborative instance per dissimilarity. (b) “The idea pervading over all cows proceeds from something different from the body of the cow,—because it appears as a differentiator,—like the idea of the ‘blue’ and the like. (c) “The ‘universal’ cow is something different from the ‘individual’ cow,—because it forms the object of a different idea;—like the idea of the colour and other qualities of the same cow,—also because it (the universal) is spoken of as belonging to that (the individual),—just as the horse is spoken of as belonging to caitra.” 
All this has no essence in it; it is an elaboration of a mere theory; there is no evidence at all in support of it. as a matter of fact, the notions of ‘being’, etc. Are not found to proceed from the functioning of the sense-organs; they arise from a body of conventions
In the case of the dhātrī, harītakī, etc., it is pound that there is present in them, either singly or collectively, the potency to remove various diseases; and yet there is no ‘universal’ (community) in them which has that potency; because the cure op the diseases is found to be quick and delayed.—Nor can any diverse peculiar properties be produced in the ‘universal’, through the diversities op the soil, etc. because it remains always in one and the same form; the said diverse properties, however, are present in the dhātrī, etc.—Thus though, as a rule, things are entirely different, yet some of them having well-defined potencies are conceived of as similar, and hence these things become the basis of the conception of similarity, etc.,—not other things
All that the expression ‘being’ (existence) is meant to convey is only the idea of capacity for action; it is in this sense that the convention is established, in regard to the things in question, or to any other thing, according to the whim (of people).—Persons using the term ‘go’ (‘ox’ or ‘cow’) establish the convention in regard to the term as applicable to things serving such diverse purposes as carrying, yielding milk and so forth.—Thus it is that all these notions of ‘being’ and the rest are found to proceed from the conception of these conventions, and not immediately after the functioning of the sense-organs
At first, every cognition appears in a form free from verbal expression; then comes in the body of conventions; hence the notions in question partake of the nature of remembrance,—for that reason also
It is because the process is as described that when a man has his mind turned somewhere else, there appears only the vague apprehension of the mere thing apart from all specific peculiarities
As regards the first reason adduced,—it is superfluous; as the fact of the notions being brought about by the body of conventions is already admitted (by us); and that same relative (body of conventions) is what is positively and negatively concomitant
If the said ‘body of convention’ is included in the ‘subject’ (of the inference propounded by the opponent), then the corroborative instance cited becomes ‘devoid of the probandum’; as the external things mentioned,—the calf and the goad, etc.—are not the direct causes of the notions; because the name and such other qualifications have no bearing upon the ‘specific peculiarity’ of things; as the ‘specific peculiarity’ of things is something beyond the reach of verbal expression
In fact, all these notions proceed on the basis of things like the goad, which consist in mere ‘idea’ and are illusory, on -which ‘externality’ is imposed
The negation of action, quality and name’ is also described (by you) as the cause of the notion of ‘non-existence’; hence the qualification serves no useful purpose.—The said description (of the cause of the notion of non-existence) also is not right; because if it is a cause, then it must be a positive entity, as possessing a definite potency. Lastly, the notion of ‘non-existence’ would be applicable to ‘being’ and such ‘universals’ also
The fact of the notions in question being different from the notions of the body, shape, etc. is not admitted (or proved); hence the reason put forward is also open to the charge of being ‘un-proven’, 
The comprehensive notion (op all cows, for instance) manifests within itself the verbal expression and the constituent individuals; while the ‘universal’ is described as devoid of all tinge of colour, shape and verbal expression
If the ‘universal’ also were in the form of ‘blue’, then, what would be its difference from ‘quality’?—As a matter of fact, however, no all-comprehensive ‘blue’ is ever perceived. even though it may be manifesting itself, it is never perceived in a differentiated form. under the circumstances, how could the idea and name apply to the individual, on the basis of the said comprehensive notion?—Further, the other party holds the notion of the ‘universal’ to be definite and certain; consequently, its non-perception cannot be right, as that would imply that it is in cognisable
Even though it may be taken as established that the notions in question have a different cause, the existence of the ‘universal’ as comprehensive, and free from impermanence, does not become established; because the notions in question appear in succession
On what basis does the term ‘category’ (‘padārtha’) rest when applied to the six (vaiśeṣika categories)? as also the notion ‘it exists’ which is found to be present in ‘being’, etc.? 
If in regard to the categories mentioned, the notion that ‘it exists’ is due to something else,—then, in regard to this ‘something’ also the notion that£ it exists’ is present; and so on and on, there would be an infinite regress,—and the character of ‘having the property’ would cease. in view of these, the reason would become ‘fallible’ (untrue).—then again the all-embracing concomitance of the reason has not yet been established
The argument in proof of the ‘universal’ that has been urged after the one just disposed of, also becomes rejected by this; because the fallacy of ‘futility’ and the rest are equally applicable to that also
Without any all-embracing basis, there isa) a particular cognition in regard to the ‘cook’; (b) similarly there is the notion of ‘negation’ in regard to negation itself; as also (c) in regard to persons and things created by imagination, and (d) in regard to dead and unborn persons.—In view of all these cognitions, the reason becomes open to the fallacy of ‘fallibility’
In fact, there is no single basis for the notions of ‘cook’ and the rest.—If it be said that “the act (of cooking) is the basis”,—then, the answer is that the act varies with each individual person; and you have postulated the ‘universal’ as embracing all individuals only, on the ground that unless there is an all-embracing entity, there can be no comprehensive notion of things which are different.—If, even without such all-embracing character, the act be regarded as the basis (of the comprehensive notion) then why should not the individuals themselves be regarded as causes of it?—Further (if the act were the basis, then) the notion of ‘cook’ could not appear in regard to the man after he has desisted from the act (of cooking); surely even the other party do not regard the act as present there at all times,—like the ‘universal’,—if it be held that “the notion and name of the cook, etc. is based on past and future action”,—then such an act cannot be the cause at all, for the simple reason that it is not present at the time
If the idea be said to be due to the presence of the act related to the ‘universal’ action,—and this permanent basis is always indicated by it even when the particular act has ceased,—[then, the answer is as given in the following text]
When the particular act has ceased, the permanent ‘universal’, even though indicated, cannot really exist; for the simple reason that its receptacle has ceased to exist
In the case of such ‘universals’ as the ‘stick’, the ‘armlet’ and the like, even though they have been indicated and perceived once (in one person),—the idea of the ‘man with the stick’ (or ‘the man with the armlet’) does not continue on the removal of the stick or armlet.—If the ‘universal’ cook were something entirely different (from the individual persons), then (as a permanent entity) it should be present in the new-born child also, who also could be conceived of as a ‘cook—if it be held that, like the idea of ‘being’ (existence), it does not subsist in a certain substratum (the child just born f.i.),—then, later on, also it could not subsist in it; as the conditions would be the same.—It may be that at the initial stage (when the child is just born) there is no inherence between the two (the universal and the particular) because of the defective character of their relationship. But if so, then, how could there be that inherence, even afterwards, when the defect would still be there? 
If the particular object be not permanent, it might acquire additional characters; but even so, the defective nature of the ‘universal’ would never cease
The name ‘cook’ is meant to be applied to that which is the principal cause of the act of cooking; and this ‘principality’ is present in another cook also.” 
What is it that is called ‘principal character’?—It cannot be a potency; because this does not subsist (in other individuals).—For the same reason it cannot be said to consist in the nature of the substance, quality or action, etc
Thus the notion that appears in regard to the ‘cook’ is dependent only upon the diversity of convention, and apprehends only the form that precludes all unlike things.—From all this it follows that all names and notions proceed diversely in accordance with convention, without there being any all-embracing entity
Thus the notion of negation with regard to negation is not incompatible; nor is the comprehensive name (incompatible); because they proceed from convention, which does not involve the assumption of any other entity
Such motions (of negation) as ‘the previous negation of the jar’, ‘the destruction of the jar’ and the like, apprehend negations with positive entities as their adjuncts; and the comprehensive character of the said notion of ‘negation’ is due to the comprehensive character of those adjuncts”,—if this is urged, then (our answer is that) this cannot be so; (a) because there is disparity and (b) because it cannot rest upon that
a) The comprehensive notion of the ‘jar’ may be rightly regarded as being due to that; not so the comprehensive notion of ‘negation’; the notion of ‘presence’ (affirmation) is entirely different from the notion of ‘absence’ (negation). (b) The notion of the ‘cow’ or the’ horse’ is not held to be due to the ‘universal’ being. If it did, then only one ‘universal’ would have to be postulated as accomplishing everything (as being the basis of all notions)
In all cases the notion is not in exact accordance with its basis,—inasmuch as the notions of ‘army’, ‘forest’ and the like have number, etc. for their basis”;—if such be the view, then, why should not the said notion in regard to these diverse things also be held to be based upon the diversity of the body of conventions set up by one’s own whim? 
When there is cognition of diversity, then there arises the desire to set up a convention;—then the convention is set up;—then comes the hearing of the name in accordance with that convention;—then the ‘body’ or ‘form’ of the convention;—then the notion (in accordance with that convention). that this is the cause (basis) of the said notions is thus known definitely through affirmative and negative premisses in regard to other causes, there would be an infinite regress 
The assumption of something else (as the cause of the comprehensive notion) is based upon the idea that the correlative of a thing should be of the same nature as that thing. but, even so, when the notions are diverse, it is far better to accept what has been just suggested (by us); as in this case, the restriction is due to the capacity of things; and it is far better to assume that which has been found to be true in regard to things whose capacity is well known,—through affirmative and negative premisses
As a matter of fact, there can be no affirmative concomitance (of the notions) with the universals: as their notion is not always present; as for negative concomitance, that is not possible in the case of what are eternal 
The view that “the universal ‘quality’ is the basis of the notion of ‘not-substance’ and the like” is not reasonable; for the same reason there can be no ‘inherence in the same object’ in the case of the notion of the ‘universal’, 
As for ‘inherence in several things’, this is present in number, etc. also, just as in the ‘universals’; hence the notion of ‘universal’ must be there in regard to number, etc. also
Universals called ‘jar’ and the rest subsist only in the jar; they cannot subsist in negations; how then does the comprehensive notion (of negation) arise in regard to these latter?—The (comprehensive) notion and name cannot be applied to one thing on the basis of what subsists in something else; for instance, the notion and name ‘cancer’ cannot be based upon the universal ‘elephant’. as a matter of fact, even ‘subsistence in one and the same thing’ is not present here. Notions of taste, colour, and heaviness might arise from their ‘subsistence in one and the same thing’; in the case in question (of negation) however, even this subsistence is not there; for the simple reason that negation does not subsist in anything at all
If it be argued that—“in this case there is the relation of qualification—and—qualified”,—then the answer is that such a relation is assumed only when some other relation is already there; for instance, the relation of qualification and qualified is assumed on the basis of the close proximity (contact) between the two factors concerned; in the absence of such contact, the relation in question cannot be possible, as there would be no basis for it
As regards such expressions as ‘the prior negation of the jar’, it is a creation of mere fancy; just like the description of ‘bravery’ in regard to an imaginary person. in cases where the relation of qualification and qualified is based upon a real entity, there is bound to be some other relation (regarded as its basis)
The objection urged by us was in regard to such notions as ‘this negation’, ‘that negation as regards the ‘universal’ subsisting in the adjunct, that subsists only in its own substratum
Nor is it held that the single all-embracing universal ‘being’ subsists in them all. because notions of ‘negation’ do not appear apart from the six categories
In the case of things created by imagination, there can be no universal subsisting in them; because there is no possibility of the existence of the individuals (that would make up the universals). Hence the ‘fallibility’ of the opponent’s reasons remains as before.—Similarly with regard to past and future things,—if there is a cognition of an eternal universal, then no such pure ‘universal’ (without the constituent individuals) can ever be apprehended. Or, if such a pure universal by itself were apprehended, then it could not be the ‘universal’ of any particulars. Such a universal could not be manifestable by particulars; just as the himālaya is not manifestable by the vindhya.—Nor can the universal be tied down to the particulars through its birth being dependent upon these,—nor lastly can the universal be dependent upon the particulars for its cognition, because it is eternal and because it is apprehended purely by itself.—There is also no possibility of its being dependent upon any such thing as the contact of its own substratum with the sense-organ concerned. Consequently this universal could either be apprehended at all times, or not apprehended at any time at all.—As regards its capacity to bring about its own cognition by itself, it may or may not have this capacity; whichsoever way it is, it would always remain so. Its natural form,—with or without the said capacity,—would be unshakeable, because it is itself permanent. Who then, could ever shake what is unshakeable? 
The universal ‘cow’ is something distinct from the individual cow, because it forms the object of a different idea,—like colour, touch and the like;—also because it is spoken of as belonging to that, just as the horse is spoken of as belonging to caitra”,—this argument may be shown to be ‘fallible’ (untrue) in view of the notion of the ‘cook’ and so forth.—In this same manner, other wrong arguments also are to be discredited
It is averred that the ‘universal subsists in several things’. What is this ‘subsistence’ meant to be?—Is it staying? Or being manifested? As for ‘staying’, which stands for not deviating from its own form,—this belongs to the universal by its very nature;—any receptacle of it gould not produce this in it, by virtue of which that substratum could be regarded as ‘that which makes it stay as for preventing its movement (which is another form of ‘subsistence’), it cannot belong to the universal, as it does to the jujube fruit (contained in the cup); because the universal is, by its nature, immobile; hence it cannot have a receptacle.—If it be held that ‘staying’ is inherence,—that cannot be accepted; as it is the exact nature of this ‘inherence’ that is being examined. In the form of the relation of the sustainer and sustained which subsists among things never found apart from each other, such ‘inherence’ is admitted by us also
In the case of water and such things, there may be a ‘receptacle’ which prevents their downward movement; in the case of üniversals however, which are immobile, what would be the use of receptacles?—In the case of what is capable of bringing about its own cognition, what would be the use of any causes of manifestation?—And also in the case of what is incapable of bringing about its own cognition, what would be the use of any causes of manifestation? If what was incapable yesterday were made capable (to-day), then the thing would be impermanent,—just like the jar manifested by the lamp
The various universals, ‘jar’ and the rest, could subsist either in their own respective receptacles or in all places,—like the ‘highest universal’ (summum genus)
When the thing comes into existence in another place, it is not understood how the universal is perceived there, or how it gains subsistence therein
The universals cannot be said to have come into existence' along with the new jar,—because they are eternal; nor can they be said to have been there already, because (ex hypothesi) they are not all-pervading; nor can they be said to have come from elsewhere, because they are immobile
When the contact of its substratum with the sense-organ and such other conditions would be present and bring about the cognition of the universal,—that universal would become perceived everywhere; because there can be no division in its form
a) If the universal (in the new individual) re not-different from that which has been already perceived,—then there should re perception of that universal also;—or (b) like it, the other also should not be perceived;—or (c) there should be difference
The notions of ‘tree’ and such things cannot be based upon the ‘universals’ postulated by the other party;—because things appear in succession, and because they are comprehensive,—like the notions of the ‘cook’ and such things.—the fact that what is eternal cannot be productive (of effects) also serves to annul the opponent’s proposition.—All the objections that were urged against ‘conjunction’ also serve to annul the opponent’s conclusion
Thus has been rejected the ‘universal’ as an entirely distinct entity. as regards the ‘universal’ postulated by the followers of Jaimini, that is going to be rejected under the chapter on ‘syādvāda’ (chapter XX)
Thus has been rejected the ‘universal’ as an entirely distinct entity. as regards the ‘universal’ postulated by the followers of Jaimini, that is going to be rejected under the chapter on ‘syādvāda’ (chapter XX)
Then again, the ‘ultimate individualities’ that have been postulated as existing in ultimate entities, have been already proved to be impossible, by the rejection of the ‘eternal substance’; they are mere ‘moments 
Then again, the ‘ultimate individualities’ that have been postulated as existing in ultimate entities, have been already proved to be impossible, by the rejection of the ‘eternal substance’; they are mere ‘moments 
Among atoms, ākāśa, space and such things (in which the ultimate individualities are held to subsist),—if their forms are distinct from each other,—then the apprehension of distinction among them need not be due to anything else in the shape of this ultimate individuality.—If, on the other hand, they have their forms mixed up with each other, then, even though there may be difference, the apprehension of absolute distinction could not but be wrong.—How too is the distinction among ‘ultimate individualities’ apprehended? If by themselves,—then why is not the same held to be the case with atoms and other things also? 
Just as the unclean character belongs to the dog’s flesh by itself, and to other things by contact with it,—so in the case in question also—and just as between the jar and the lamp, the lamp, by itself, is always the illuminator of the jar, because it is of the nature of light,—so also in the case in question.” 
As a matter of fact, this ‘unclean character’ is something purely illusory, not real; how then could it be there either ‘by itself’ or ‘through something else’?—Or, even if the unclean character be something real, it may be that other things become ‘unclean’ through contact with the dog’s flesh; nothing like this is possible in the case of eternal substances, because there can be no ‘becoming’ (being born) for them.—Through the influence of the lamp, momentary objects,—like the jar, the ornament and so forth,—become the cause of the production of cognitions; but the apprehension of distinction cannot come about through the influence of the ‘ultimate individualities’ in question,—because it comes about in succession,—like pleasure and the rest
As a matter of fact, this ‘unclean character’ is something purely illusory, not real; how then could it be there either ‘by itself’ or ‘through something else’?—Or, even if the unclean character be something real, it may be that other things become ‘unclean’ through contact with the dog’s flesh; nothing like this is possible in the case of eternal substances, because there can be no ‘becoming’ (being born) for them.—Through the influence of the lamp, momentary objects,—like the jar, the ornament and so forth,—become the cause of the production of cognitions; but the apprehension of distinction cannot come about through the influence of the ‘ultimate individualities’ in question,—because it comes about in succession,—like pleasure and the rest
Inherence (subsistence) is apprehended on the basis of the notion of ‘this subsists in that’,—such as is found in the expressions ‘the cloth consists of (subsists in) these yarns’, ‘the mat consists of (subsists in) the reeds’.” 
Inherence (subsistence) is apprehended on the basis of the notion of ‘this subsists in that’,—such as is found in the expressions ‘the cloth consists of (subsists in) these yarns’, ‘the mat consists of (subsists in) the reeds’.” 
If there were no such thing (as inherence), what would be the basis of the said notion? no particular notion is found to appear without a particular cause.—inasmuch as the same notion of ‘subsisting herein’ is equally present in all cases, inherence does not vary, like conjunction. in fact it is perceived in all things as one and the same, just like ‘existence’.—inasmuch as its cause is never apprehended, it is eternal,—like ‘existence by no means of valid cognition is its cause apprehended.” 
As a matter of fact, the idea of ‘subsisting in this’ exists for our opponents only; and it is due entirely to their infatuation with their own doctrine; it is never met with in common experience
If the ‘container’ and the ‘contained’ were perceived as distinct from one another, then alone would there be any such notion as ‘this subsists in that’,—as is found in the case of the fruits and the pit (where the fruits lie);—the cloth and the yarns however are never perceived as distinct from one another,—by virtue of which there could appear any such notions as ‘this subsists in those’
In the case of this notion imagined by mere whim,—as in the case of merely assumed things,—it cannot be eight to question the other party regarding its basis
The notion that does appear in ordinary experience is in the form ‘the branches in the tree’, ‘the stones in the hill’; and this notion proceeds from the fact that the two (the branch and the stones) are perceived to be in close contact with the other portions of the two ‘immovables’ (tree and hill). The notion that ‘those two (tree and mountain) subsist in these (branches and the stones)’ however that is put forward (by the opponent) is one that is beyond all ordinary experience.—What such notions as ‘this colour or that action in this jar’ apprehend is identity; the general terms ‘colour’ (‘action’), ‘jar’ connote these things generally, in all states and conditions; hence for the purpose of mentioning their particular forms, they are spoken of in the manner expressed in the said notions ‘and it is on the basis of those particular forms that the notion appears in that form,—not on the basis of ‘inherence’ because the distinction among all these is not perceived
If there were one and the same inherence in all things, then the notion of ‘cloth’ should appear in the potsherd also; it would also follow that the universal ‘cow’ subsists in the elephant also; so that the elephant also should have the form of the cow, just like the variegated cow.—The notion that ‘the cloth subsists in the yarns’ is based upon inherence; this same inherence, being present in the potsherds also, why is it that there is no such notion as that ‘the cloth subsists in the potsherds’?—If it be urged that this is so for the simple reason that the cloth does not subsist in the potsherds,—then the answer is that in the yarns also, it subsists only by inherence; is this inherence then not present in the potsherds? In fact the inherence of the cloth in the yarns must be the same as the inherence of the cloth [read ‘paṭasya’ acc. to comm.] in the potsherds; and hence there could be no restriction in the notion at all
Similarly, the inherence of the universal ‘elephant’ in the elephant should be one and the same as the inherence of the various universals ‘cow’ and the rest in their respective substrata
Even though inherence is one, the restriction of container and contained is always there; by virtue of which the universal ‘substance’ is present in substances only, and the universal ‘action’ is present in actions only.” 
From the perception of the fact that the notion of ‘subsisting in this’, which arises out of ‘inherence’, is present in all cases, it is concluded that ‘inherence’ is one only; at the same time, from the perception of the fact that such bases as the universals ‘substance’ and the rest are absent in certain cases, it is concluded that the notions of these universals ‘substance’ and the rest are restricted in their scope.” 
Even though ‘conjunction’ is one only, yet the- relation of container and contained is restricted to the pit and the curd (placed therein); similarly there would be restriction in the case in question also. so that, even though inherence is one only, yet as there would be diversity in the character of being the manifester and manifested, there would be no incongruity in it at all.” 
If inherence is one only, then any restriction regarding the container and contained is impossible. the universal ‘substance’ is held to subsist in substance only;—how could that be due to inherence? this same inherence of the substance is present in quality, etc. also; as these latter are related to the universals ‘quality’, etc.;—and inherence is the same in both
If it were not so, then this (inherence) would be different in the various universals like ‘quality’, etc.,—just as conjunction varies with each conjunct factor
It is not possible that there should be absence of notions based upon the universal ‘substance’,—when the basis is there. for the same reason there cannot be restriction of it
The expressions of ‘being contained’ and ‘subsisting’ and the like also are based upon the same ‘inherence’; hence these also cannot be the basis of restriction
The difference in the capacity to manifest and to be manifested also is based upon inherence itself; it cannot be due to anything else; because there can be no ‘producing’ of things that are eternal
By the mere presence of the lamp, the lamp does not become capable of producing any notions; so also the universals like ‘jar’ (cannot become capable of producing notions)
That the conjunction in the case of the curd and the pit is one only has been already rejected by us before; any restriction on that basis is not possible; as that would lead to absurdities
By the eternality of inherence all things become eternal; because all these are ever present, by inherence in their own substratum
Things become destroyed either through the disruption of their components, or through the destruction of these,—just like action,—on account of conjunction and such other causes”;—if this is urged, then, that cannot be so; because the inherence of these components also in their substratum is held to be eternal. if these came to destruction, then inherence also would become destructible.” 
When the relative has ceased to exist, it is impossible for the relation to exist. when the conjunct object has been destroyed, the conjunction can no longer be there. and just as the conjuncts are there while the conjunction is there,—so also the inherents should exist while the inherence is there
Even on the destruction of one relative, the inherence continues to exist, because the other relative is still there.—nor would the same be the case with conjunction; because there is difference.” 
If it is as explained, then when certain inherent objects like the jar have ceased to exist,—what is it that continues to exist? (a) Is it that inherence which has been assumed to constitute the existence of those objects, which inherence continues to exist in the other relatives? Or (b) is it something else, as in the case of conjunction, plurality and so forth?a) It cannot be the former; if the inherence of that kind continues to exist, then the said objects—jar, etc.—also should be there. If they were not there, then the inherence that constitutes their existence could not remain there; or it might be there in mere name.—From all this it follows that even before, as after, the objects could not be subsisting in their substratum, through any such thing as ‘inherence’. Thus this ‘subsistence’ of theirs cannot be real
b) If, on the other hand, the ‘inherence’ that continues to exist, while the other relative is there, is something different,—as in the case of conjunction, disjunction, plurality and so forth,—then, in that case, there would be plurality of inherence also, just as there is of conjunction, etc.—Thus, if ‘inherence’ is postulated to exist, then there would be this and many other incongruities
b) If, on the other hand, the ‘inherence’ that continues to exist, while the other relative is there, is something different,—as in the case of conjunction, disjunction, plurality and so forth,—then, in that case, there would be plurality of inherence also, just as there is of conjunction, etc.—Thus, if ‘inherence’ is postulated to exist, then there would be this and many other incongruities
If adjuncts do not exist in reality, then on what basis would there be such cognitions and verbal expressions as ‘the man with the stick’, ‘the white’, ‘move’, ‘exists’, ‘cow’, ‘here’ and so forth?—They cannot be held to be baseless. nor can they apply promiscuously to all things.” 
If adjuncts do not exist in reality, then on what basis would there be such cognitions and verbal expressions as ‘the man with the stick’, ‘the white’, ‘move’, ‘exists’, ‘cow’, ‘here’ and so forth?—They cannot be held to be baseless. nor can they apply promiscuously to all things.” 
The answer to the above is as follows:—as a matter of fact, there is no real basis for these expressions and notions; the only basis for them consists in the seed located in the purely subjective consciousness
Whatever is said to be the object of a verbal expression is never really cognised; such is the very essence of entities
Specific individuality’, ‘universal ‘relation to universal’, ‘something endowed with the universal ‘form of the cognition of the object’,—none of these really find a place in the ‘import of words 
Of these, ‘specific individuality’ cannot be denoted by words; because it can have no connection with the time of convention and usage
Things of the nature of individuals cannot become inter-related among themselves,—because there are differences (among them) of place, time, action, potency, manifestation and the rest.—For this reason, the thing conceived by convention is never met with in actual usage; and that in regard to which no convention has been apprehended can never be comprehended through words,—like any other thing
Even in the Himālaya and such things which do not differ with time and place,—there are atoms which are diverse and momentary, as proved above
As a matter of fact, there can be no assumption of convention in regard either to the born or to the unborn thing. there can be no real convention relating to the unborn,—as there can be none relating to the horse’s horn;—nor one in regard to the born thing; because convention is made only on the recalling to mind of things apprehended beforehand;—how could this be done in regard to what has passed away long ago? 
As for the other thing of the same kind which appears through the potency of the thing apprehended at first, the body of convention is not possible in regard to that also. As for similarity, that also is only imaginary
The idea of ‘heat’ that follows on the utterance of the name (‘hot’) is not so clear and distinct as the perception of the (hot) thing brought about by the sense-organ
It is not right that there should be any connection between the specific individuality and the word; nor does the thing appear in the cognition brought about by the word; just as taste does not appear in the cognition of colour
In this same manner the individual and the configuration also may be rejected; inasmuch as others regard both these also as being of the nature of ‘specific individuality’
Inasmuch as the reputation of substance, etc. and of contact, has been previously set forth,—it cannot be right to regard these as forming the real ‘import’ of words
The universal and the connection having been already rejected in detail,—the other three kinds of ‘import of words’ no longer remain possible
For these reasons the assertion that ‘the individual, the configuration and the universal are denoted by words’ is impossible; because all these are formless
As regards the ‘form of cognition’, it rests in the cognition itself, and does not follow either the object or another cognition; hence that also cannot serve the purpose (of the other party); as that also cannot really be denoted (by words)
These same arguments serve to set aside such ‘import of words’ as has been held to consist in the denotation of the verb ‘to be’ and the like. still we are going to say something regarding these
They say that what is denoted by the verb ‘to be’ constitutes the ‘import’ of all words,—in connection with the cow and such things; it is just as in the case of words like apūrva, (unseen force), devatā (deity) and svarga (heaven)
Some people assert that what is denoted by words is (a) an aggregate free from distributive and collective determination; or (b) an unreal relationship
c) or the real with unreal adjuncts is the ‘import of words’
d) Or ‘import of words’ may consist in the word itself in the state of ‘abhijalpa’ (coalescence)
When the form of the word becomes identified with the object through the conception that ‘this is that’,—that word they regard as in the ‘state of coalescence’
When an object forms the content of the idea, on the basis of an external object,—and it comes to be cognised as ‘an external object’; this (mixture of idea—object) has been regarded by some people as forming the ‘import of words’
In short, all words are productive of intuition, through repeated usage; as is found in the case of making things known to children and animals
What is expressed by the verb ‘to be’ is said to be denoted by words;—is it meant to be the ‘specific individuality’ of things? or the ‘universal’? Or the contact? Or something else which reflects the cognition?—The objections to everyone of these alternatives have been already set forth above. further, as for what is expressed by the verb ‘to be’, which has been held to form the import of words,—there can be no diverse usage based upon that
It (usage) would be based upon the mere ‘being’ of things as qualified by the universal ‘cow’ and the word (‘cow’); and the opinion that has been held is due to the fact that there are such diversities of form as the presence of horns, the particular shape, the particular colour ‘blue’ and so forth.” 
If this be so, then there should be denotation of the thing as equipped with those, as also of the diverse particulars. And in that case, the same objections would be applicable. Apart from these, there is found nothing ‘expressed by the verb to be’
Under the view that what is denoted is the ‘aggregate’, there is clear conception of ‘universals’ and ‘particulars as what are denoted are austerity, caste, conduct and the rest collectively
Any sort of relation among substance and the rest, whose nature has been duly ascertained, as also any real ‘universal’,—has been already discarded
898) Inasmuch as the import of words cannot consist of particulars or universals, there can be no form of the word as coalesced (identified) with its denotation. Then again, this ‘coalescence’ also must reside in the cognition itself, inasmuch as it is different from external relationship. Under the circumstances, what would be the difference between this view and the view that the cognition or idea itself constitutes the import of words?—As regards the view that the form of the idea (or cognition) is what is denoted by words,—that has been already rejected, on the ground that it would be nothing different from the idea and as such could not be pervasive
As regards ‘intuition’, which has been regarded as the ‘import of words’,—if it appertains to the external object, then, inasmuch as the external object has one particular character, how could there be various ‘intuitions’?—If the ‘intuitions’ be held to be objectless, and existing only in the form of faculties,—then how could there be either comprehension or activity regarding external things?—If it be held that these two (cognition and activity) abandon the external form and rest within themselves,—then the import of words becomes unreal, false—as proceeding through illusion.—Nor can intuition be held to be baseless; as in that case, it should appear everywhere.—If the basis of it be held to consist in the ‘mutual exclusion’ among things,—then that is exactly our view
Again, is all this momentary or not? If it is momentary, then there can be no co-ordination. if otherwise, there should be no successive cognition
This same argument serves to set aside the ‘desire to speak’ as (held to be) cognised through words. when, as shown above, there can be no ‘denotation of words’, how could there be any ‘desire to speak’? Or even the word itself? 
How can the word be applied,—merely through similarity,—to what is hot expressed by it? And the view that it is through similarity, as in the case of the names of twins, is also discarded by this same argument
When two persons think of the form figuring in the ‘desire to speak’ and in the ‘inference’ as something external, then the word becomes applied to it”;—if this view be held, then that again is exactly our opinion
Why do you say that the word brings about the ‘exclusion of others’? as a matter of fact mere negation is not apprehended in the idea brought about by the word; on the contrary, in the case of all such words as ‘cow’, ‘gavaya’, ‘elephant’, ‘tree’ and so forth,—the verbal cognition that results is always in the positive form.” 
If the whole purpose of the word ‘cow’ is served by the. ‘exclusion of others’,—then, please find some other word which brings about the notion of ‘cow’ in regard to the cow itself.” 
In fact, cognition is the fruit of words; and no single word can have two fruits. how too could both affirmation and negation be the fruit of any one word?” 
When one hears the word ‘cow’ uttered, he should, first of all have the idea of the non-cow,—as the word ‘cow’ would have been uttered for the purpose of negativing the ‘non-cow’.” 
Those who have admitted the universal ‘negation of the non-cow’ as the import of the word have, by the expression, admitted the universal ‘cow’ as an entity.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 1] 
Inasmuch as all ‘inexistence’ has been held to be of the nature of some other ‘existence’,—please say what that ‘inexistence’ is which is of the nature of the ‘negation of the horse (and otehr non-cows)’?—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 2] 
You do not admit of any individuality in the nature of something uncommon (unique), because it is devoid of conceptual content; so also (you do not admit) the ‘variegated animal’ and the like; as in that case the import would not be universal (common).—Hence the idea of the ‘cow’ must be based upon that form which subsists in common in every single individual (cow); [and in this there can be no dispute between us].”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 3 & 10] 
If the import of words be assumed to be of the nature of mere negation, then it would only be another kind of ‘void’ spoken of by means of the negative word.” 
In that ‘void’ there would be an apprehension of the character of the cognitions themselves of the horse and other things; and in that case it would be useless to posit the ‘Apoha (negation) of others’ as the import of words.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 37] 
In that case, the ‘form of the Cognition which is posited as the ‘Import of Words’, would be the Universal.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 38] 
As a matter of fact, whenever the said cognition appears in connection with the import of words, it is always in the form of a positive entity; hence in such cases, the import could be assumed to consist of the positive entity only,—a cognition not of the nature of ‘Apoha’.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 39] 
even in the absence of the corresponding external object there is intuition expressed by the sentence; similar may be the case with what is expressed by the word also; why should the apoha be postulated at all?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 43] 
In the case of a cognition, no ‘exclusion of another cognition’ is apprehended; in fact, apart from the coming about of its own form, the cognition carries with it no other factor.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 41] 
If Apoha formed the import of words, then all words would be synonymous,—those that denote diverse universals, as well as those that denote particulars.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 42] 
There can be no difference among Apohas, because they are non-entities, and devoid of all such conceptions as ‘related ‘one’ and’ many.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 45] 
If the Apohas are different, then they must be entities, because of that difference,—just like the specific individuality of things. If they are non-entities, then they cannot be many, and hence they cannot escape from being synonymous.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 46] 
There would certainly be difference among Apohas, based upon the difference among the horse and other things.—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 47]a) “In fact, there can be no distinction among Apohas—either by themselves, or through others.”—[ibid.]b) 
When even the substrata to which they are related do not make any difference in the form of the Apohas,—that they would be differentiated by the excluded things, which are exterior to them, would be an assumption that is too far-fetched.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 52] 
In the same manner, its diversity cannot be due to the diversity of its substratum;—diversity in the relative of a thing does not justify the assumption of diversity in the thing also. How much less there is exclusion possible for that which is a non-entity, unrelated, undifferentiated, unspecified, vague and undetermined?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 48-49] 
As a matter of fact, no one can conceive of the cow and other things—any similarity of form among whom is not admitted,—to be the substratum of Apoha.” 
In the absence of a common property, it is not possible to determine the things excluded (by Apoha). For this reason also there can be no Apoha.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 72] 
Of the word and the indicative, no operation is possible without concomitance;—and without these (word and the indicative), there can be no Apoha;—and there can be no concomitance for what is ‘uncommon’ (unique, specific).”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 73] 
While the Apoha itself has not become accomplished,—where could the concomitance be asserted (which is necessary for the proper functioning of all indicatives)? And if the concomitance is not perceived,—there would be no validity in these (word and indicative).”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 74] 
They could not signify anything by mere non-perception; because non-perception being common in all cases, there could be no distinction.—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 75] 
It might be argued that—Even in the absence of similarity of form, there could be assumption of Apoha;—then why is the Apoha of the ‘non-cow’ not assumed in the case of the cow and the horse?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 76] 
Difference from the spotted cow is the same in the black cow and in the horse. so that if no other ‘commonalty’ is admitted, whereto would, the Apoha of the non-cow apply?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 77] 
As a matter of fact, the Apoha of the non-cow has never been previously perceived by the sense-organs;—and the operation of words does not lie anywhere else. On the perception of what then would the word be used?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 78] 
by what has gone before, there can be no inference either, in this case; and for the same reason there can be no conception of any connection of this.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 79] 
How could one apprehend the fact of something not being denoted by the word ‘cow’—‘It could be learnt from the fact that the word cow was not found to be applied to it at the moment of the apprehension of the connection of that word’. [This is what the Bauddha may say.]”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 81] 
In that case, all things, with the sole exception of the single individual cow, would become excluded by the Apoha; and in that case it would not be proved that any commonalty constitutes the import of words.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 82] 
It is only a well-established entity in the shape of the non-cow that could be excluded by the Apoha (denoted by the word ‘cow’);—and the non-cow is of the nature of the negation of the cow;—hence it has to be explained what this cow is which is negatived (in the non-cow).—If this cow is of the nature of the negation of the non-cow, then there is mutual interdependence.—If the cow is admitted as an entity for the sake of the Apoha, then the postulating of the Apoha becomes futile.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 83-84] 
Unless the cow is established, there can be no non-cow; and if there is no non-cow, how can the cow be there? Between two negations, there can be no such relation as that of the container and the contained and the like.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 85] 
As a matter of fact, any thing uncommon (unique, specific) is never cognised as qualified by the Apoha. how too could any relationship be assumed between an entity and a non-entity?—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 86] 
In fact, nothing can serve as a qualification. by its mere existence; it is only when it colours the qualified with its own cognition that it becomes its qualification.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 87] 
The terms ‘horse’ and the rest do not bring about the cognition of the Apoha; and the idea of the qualified that is held in this connection cannot be one in which the qualification is not cognised.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 88] 
The qualification cannot bring about a cognition which is like something totally different; for how can that be said to be the qualification in a cognition which is like something different?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 89] 
If a qualification be regarded as such even in regard to the qualified thing which is totally different, then, everything can serve as the qualification (of everything).”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 90] 
If the qualified thing is cognisable in the form of negation, then it cannot be an entity; consequently for you, there can be no entity that could be denoted by words as qualified by Apoha.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 91] 
Even though the word and the indicative may not operate upon anything devoid of Apoha,—yet the cognition rests upon the entity which is what it apprehends.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 92] 
As a matter of fact, the uncommon thing never figures in the cognition; nor again can it be rightly regarded as cognisable, because it is ‘indeterminate’.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 93] 
The statement that ‘what is not apprehended by the word is yet qualified’ is too bold. for all these reasons the commonalty should be regarded as the object of words and indicatives.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 94] 
When individualities could not be what is ‘excluded by apoha’ because they are not denoted by words,—then the commonalty (universal) alone is what could be ‘excluded’; and because of its ‘exclusion’, it must be an entity.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 95] 
Mere negations cannot be objects of ‘exclusion’,—for, if they were, they would lose their negative character. consequently, it is clear that when there is an ‘exclusion’ (Apoha) of another ‘exclusion’ (Apoha), it can be only of a positive entity in the shape of the commonalty (or universal).”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 96] 
If the negation of a negation is different from it,—then it must be a positive entity. If not, then the cow will be the same as the non-cow for you.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 97] 
Though in the case of other words, a positive entity may be what is ‘excluded’,—yet in the case of the word ‘sat’ (‘being’), nothing apart from ‘negation’ is regarded as ‘excluded’.—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 98] 
In that case, even the non-existent (non-being) would have a positive character; which would be a great calamity.—And when there is no negation, there would be no existence (positive) at all; and (as a consequence) non-existence also would be impossible.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 99] 
Either diversity or the positive character of Apohas cannot be assumed to be due to the diversity of impressions; because impression cannot be held to exist when there is no entity.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 100] 
You cannot base the diversity among words also upon the said conditions. there can be no ‘uncommon’ denotative word, as no such could have been perceived before. Under the circumstances, if a ‘commonalty’ were assumed in the shape of the ‘Apoha (exclusion) of other words’,—as it could only be a non-entity, as shown above, there could be no diversity among words.—Just as among denotative words, so between the ‘denoted’ and ‘denotative’ also there could be no difference. That there can be no ‘difference’ based upon the difference in the ‘excluded things’ has already been explained.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 102, 104, 105] 
There could be no relation of denoted and denotative between the two Apohas, because they are non-entities, under your view; just as the ‘sky-flower’ and the ‘hare’s horn’ are, according to ordinary people.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 108] 
If some one, perceiving the said relation between the nonexistent rain and the non-existent cloud, were to urge ‘inconclusiveness’ against our reason,—then, according to our view, there is an entity in the case cited also; but how could it be under your view?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 109] 
When one does not admit the denotation of the word to be positive (affirmative) in character, there can be no negation also for him; as this is always preceded by that.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 110] 
It is held that what is denoted is Apoha only; under this theory, there can be no possibility of the relation of qualification and qualified or of co-ordination, in the case of such verbal expressions as ‘blue-lotus’, which have a mixed connotation; because the ‘exclusion of the non-blue’ does not involve the ‘exclusion of the non-lotus’,—nor does the latter involve the former, hence the relation of qualification and qualified is not possible (between the blue colour and the lotus).—Nor would the said relation be possible between the words apart from what they denote.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 115-117] 
Co-ordination is not possible, as the Apohas are different.—if it be held to subsist on the basis of what is denoted, then what sort of ‘subsistence’ would there be between the two?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 118] 
As a matter of fact, nothing ‘uncommon’ is ever apprehended; and anything else does not exist for you. where then would be the use of the co-ordination of words, which is not apprehended at all?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 119] 
If it be said that what is denoted is the entity along with the Apoha,—there also, concomitance with the word would be unattainable, as it would be dependent upon something else.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 120] 
There can be no connection between the apoha and gender, number, etc. as the individual is inexpressible, there can be no connection through that either.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 135] 
In the case of verbs, the ‘exclusion of others’ is never cognised; because in their case there is nothing to be denied which could form the object of exclusion.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 139] 
Even when na-na would be uttered, there would be negation of negation only; so that the pacati (action of cooking) would remain there in its own (positive) form.—similarly in the case of verbs there is the idea of being in course of accomplishment, as also that of the past, etc.; and as Apoha is something well-established, these ideas would be baseless (if Apoha were all that is denoted by words).”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 140-141] 
In the case of the whole mass of denotations like injunction and the like,—there is no idea of the ‘exclusion of others how could there be any Apoha even when the negative is coupled with negation?—Particles like ‘cm’ and the rest can have no connection with the negative; hence here also no Apoha is possible.—In the case of what is expressed by a sentence, the ‘exclusion of others’ cannot even be indicated.—In the case of such expressions as ‘ananyāpoha’ (‘non-exclusion of others’), no denotation is apprehended at all (apart from the positive).—Wherefore too could there be anything ‘excluded’ in the case of such words as ‘prameya’ and ‘jñeya’ (which embrace all conceivable things)?”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 140-141] 
Rather than assume the thing to be excluded, it is ear better to assume the entity itself.—As the idea of things being of the form of cognitions has been rejected, what is denoted cannot be anything internal (subjective); nor is it possible for any subjective thing to be ‘excluded’. Thus there can be no Apoha in the case of the words in question.—Lastly, in the case of such words as ‘eva’, nothing is found to be ‘excluded”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 140-141] 
In the case of the word ‘all’ (‘sarva’) what is it that is assumed to be the ‘excluded’? There is no such thing as the non-all, which could be excluded.—If it be urged that ‘one and the rest’ are the non-all, then it comes to be the exclusion of the denotation itself; as the parts would be excluded, and no whole is admitted.—Similarly, in regard to the denotation of the word ‘group’ (‘samūha’), the constituents would be excluded; and nothing apart from this is admitted; hence all such words become deprived of their meaning.—As regards the words ‘two’ and the rest, which also are applied to groups, as the ‘one’ and other constituents would be excluded, they could no longer be so applicable.—Then again, the denotation of the word ‘cow’ is said to be the ‘non-non-cow’;—now is this positive or negative? If it is positive, is it the cow or the non-cow?—If it is the cow, then there is no dispute; as the denotation turns out to be of the positive character. On the other hand, if it is the non-cow that is denoted by the word ‘cow’,—that would exhibit a wonderful insight into the meanings of words indeed!—Nor can it be negative; as, in that case injunction and the rest would not be possible.—Nor does any one ever comprehend a negation from the word ‘cow’.” 
Why is the denotation of the word (‘cow’) held to be the Apoha—in the form ‘the cow is not non-cow’? Who has ever attributed the character of the non-cow to the cow—that it is denied here?—It is held that it is the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ in the cow, which forms the denotation of the word;—is this held to be something different from the cow? Or non-different?—If it is different, does it abide—or not abide—anywhere? If it does abide, then it becomes a quality, and the word cannot be denotative of the substance;—and thus as the word ‘cow’ would denote only a quality, there would be no co-ordination in such expressions as ‘the cow moves’, ‘the cow stands—if it does not abide in any thing, then what would be the sense in which it could be mentioned, for the purpose of exclusion, by the term ‘agoḥ’, ‘of the non-cow’?—If, lastly, the ‘Apoha’, ‘exclusion of others’ is held by you to be non-different (from the cow),—then it comes to be the same as cow; what more would, in that case, be expressed (by the term ‘Apoha’)?” 
Is this Apoha one and the same in connection with all things? or is it several?—If one, then, being related to several cows, it would be the same as the universal—‘cow’—if it is several, then it would be endless,—like so many individual objects. consequently, just like the diverse individuals, this also could not be ‘denoted’
This Apoha, ‘exclusion of other things’—is it itself denoted or not-denoted? Even if it is denoted, is it denoted as something positive? Or only as the ‘negation of other things’?—If it is denoted as something positive, then you should abandon your extremist view, whereby it has been asserted that ‘in every case it is the exclusion of other things that is denoted by words.’—If, on the other hand, the said ‘exclusion’ (Apoha) is denoted in the form of the ‘exclusion of other things’,—then such a view would involve an infinite regress.—If then it be held by you that the said Apoha (exclusion of other things) is not denoted, then your assertion, that ‘the word always brings about the exclusion of other things’, would become annulled.” 
Further, one-ness, eternality and subsistence in every individual,—ore who would attribute these to Apohas which are peatureless, would be making cloth without yarns.—From all this it follows that the element of ‘exclusion of others’ could be present only in the denotation of those words wherein the negative term is present; in all other cases the thing itself is what is denoted.”—[Ślokavārtika-Apoha 163-164] 
All these are wrong views based upon ignorance of what is meant by the ‘apoha, negation, of other things’.—People who are themselves damned damn others also.—As a matter of fact, Apoha is of two kinds due to difference between Paryudāsa (relative negation, contradistinction, exclusion) and (2) niṣedha (absolute negation, denial, prohibition). Paryudāsa again is of two kindsa) due to difference of conception (idea), and (b) due to difference of concept (object)
It has been explained on a previous occasion (text 723) that things like the Harītakī and other things, though distinct from one another, become the basis of unitary conception. on the basis of such things, there appears a reflection in the determinate cognition,—which reflection is definitely apprehended (conceived of) as ‘objects’, even though the objective character is absent in it. [And it is this conception of the reflected image that is called ‘Apoha’]
Because it appears as ‘excluded’ (distinguished) from other ‘appearances’, because it is the basis (cause) of the cognition of a thing as ‘excluded’ from others, because it is cognised through an entity ‘excluded’ (from others),—and (4) because it is apprehended in the form of the ‘specific individuality’ consisting in the ‘exclusion’ of unlike things, by persons confounded by its sameness—the name ‘Apoha, exclusion, of others’ has been given to it, on the said basis
So also, in regard to the ‘specific individuality’ which is the basis of the said ‘exclusion’;—on the ground that there is in it the ‘exclusion’ of others
Negation absolute’ we have in such instances as ‘the cow is not non-cow’; in this the ‘negation of the other’ is very clearly apprehended
It is the first of these Apohas that is expressed by words; because the cognition brought about by words apprehends the external object
When the cognition of the reflection in that form has resulted from the word, there has come about the relation of denoted and denotative, in the shape of cause and effect
The direct form (of Apoha) having been explained as above, absolute negation also is apprehended by implication,—in the form that the nature of this thing is not the nature of the other thing.—When there is connection (of the word) with certain things, there comes about, by implication, the apprehension of ‘excluded’ things also.—Hence this also is figuratively spoken of as the ‘denotation’ of the word,—these two kinds of verbal Apoha are not directly spoken of as such
When the word brings about the exclusion of other things, it is said to ‘denote its own meaning’; and there is no incongruity in this
The word is said to ‘denote’, because it produces a reflection of the conception of the external thing; it does not touch the exclusive factor in the shape of the specific individuality; apart from the said production of the reflection, there is no other denotative function of the word
It is only when the reflection has been cognised that there follows the ‘exclusion of other things’, by implication; because the idea of ‘others’ does not form part of the reflection at all
As in the case of the sentence speaking of ‘not eating at night’, the word in question has two fruits (resultants),—one direct and the other by implication; and it is so because there is no affirmation entirely without negation
Because the word does hot directly bring about both these, the idea of its own denotation, and (2) the exclusion of another thing
The universal ‘cow’ also is held to be an appearance of the same kind; inasmuch it is apprehended as common to all cows—the variegated and the rest
1022) commentary. 
Because it is cognised as a positive ‘entity’, therefore it is called a ‘positive entity’;—this mistaken cognition is produced quickly from its seed
That same ‘form of the cognition’ called the ‘Apoha’, is the ‘denotation of the word’,—also (regarded as) a ‘positive entity in the form of the ‘commonalty’; on account of its being apprehended as such, through mistake
It is not right to regard its character of universal entity, as real; being non-different from the cognition, how could it appertain to another thing? 
Though this form of ‘Apoha’ is not different from the form of the cognition, yet its external character is apprehended only by deluded persons
It is not entirely independent of the object, inasmuch as the notion of that comes in indirectly; and yet in that form, the character of positive entity does not belong to it, as explained before
That Apoha which is in the form of reflection, and which also is called ‘intuition’, is produced by the word also; and we readily regard this as the denotation of words
Owing to the fact of its not bearing any factor apart from the appearance of its own form, its ‘exclusion from another cognition’ becomes duly apprehended
In the case of what does not exist, any difference that may be there cannot be real; so also would be its non-difference; and hence the words would certainly be synonymous
Non-difference’ consists in being of the same form; how can this be there in what are formless? Words become synonyms only when what is denoted by them is one and the same
Just as, even in the absence of form, there is imaginary unity (uniformity),—in the same manner, difference also could be imaginary; whence then could the words be synonymous? 
In reality, words are neither synonymous nor not-synonymous; as it has been explained that what is denoted by them is neither one and the same nor diverse
But whenever more than one thing is seen to be performing one and the same function, the property of ‘oneness’ is imposed on them and the same word is applied to them
In the case of the eye and other things, all tending to bring about the single effect in the shape of the cognition of colour,—if someone were to apply a common name, even without a comprehensive (common) element [in the same manner would it be in other cases also]
Though the action of the jar and other things, in the shape of holding water, etc.,—and also the cognition of those things,—are different (diverse),—yet, as it forms the basis of a single (comprehensive) conception, the cognition is said to be one only; and as this cognition forms the basis, the things also are spoken of as not-diverse (one)
Of these, words like ‘jar’ have been said to be common denotatives, on the single basis of the reflection distinguished (excluded) from unlike things 
Similarly, when performing several fruitful functions, even a single thing is spoken of as if it were many,—by virtue of the multiplicity of the exclusions of things not performing those functions
For instance, colour is spoken of as an ‘obstacle’ and also as ‘visible’;—and sound is spoken of as ‘cognised after effort’, and also as ‘auditory’ or ‘audible 
In some cases, the word is applied, also on the basis of the diversity of other causes; e.g. sound arising from effort, and the honey produced by the large bees
In some cases, the word is applied on the basis of the exclusion of the effect and cause of the thing; as for example, colour is spoken of as ‘inaudible’, or lightning is spoken of as ‘not produced by effort’
Due to the said and other distinctions, ‘exclusions’ are postulated on the basis of differentiated things; and so also are the words as applied to those things. thus words, as denoting distinct things in accordance with convention, are applied with due differentiation; and as such they are not synonymous under our view
Nor is there any incongruity in universals and particulars being denoted by words, as appertaining to larger and smaller number of things,—on the basis of the inference of the relevant convention
The said ‘exclusions’ of things, created by mere assumption, cannot really differ, through difference in the ‘excluded things’, or through that in the substratum
The externality that is attributed to these exclusions is only assumed (imaginary), not real. in reality, difference and non-difference subsist only in real things
What differ among themselves are the conceptual contents apprehending the said exclusions;—and those differences are due to the influence of their root, the thing as differentiated from several things, and convention. Things, consisting of ‘specific individualities’ do not become either unified or diversified in parts; it is only the conceptual content that varies
Even though there is no common property, yet what are excluded and what are contained in the exclusion are apprehended as different, by reason of their appearing as diverse in the subsequent determinate judgment
It would be only a few things which, while being diverse by themselves, would bring about a single determinate judgment; as already explained by us
The ‘specific individuality’ consists of the thing-by-itself, as ‘excluded from what is not itself’;—an assertion of concomitance carefully made in this form would not be incongruous
That wherein subsists the specific individuality (smoke) differentiated from non-smoke,—in that same subsists also the specific individuality (fire) differentiated from non-fire; as in the kitchen; and herein (in the hill) there is the specific individuality differentiated from non-smoke;—hence the specific individuality differentiated from non-fire also must be there
The specific individuality that is differentiated from ‘man’s horns’ and other non-existent things is also differentiated from permanent things,—just as the cognition, the lamp-flame, etc. are;—the specific individuality of sound, etc. is not a non-existent thing.—In this way there can be the assertion of concomitance through differences as indicated
The specific individuality itself, when its distinction is not meant to be emphasised, has been described as constituting the ‘universal’ (or commonalty);—nothing else; as nothing else is acceptable
The difference from the variegated cow being equally present in the black cow and the horse, why is it that the universal ‘cow’, as differentiated from the horse, subsists in that? 
If it be held that ‘that alone has the capacity to manifest it’—then, even though the subsequent determinate judgment is the same, that alone has the capacity to produce it, and not the horse
Thus then, in whatever thing the said determinate judgment is present,—to that the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’ becomes applicable,—even in the absence of the universal ‘cow’
That thing which is ‘different from the non-cow’ is certainly apprehended by the sense-organs; the reflection also which is superimposed upon it is apprehended by its own cognition. it is on noticing this that people use the word; the recognition of its relation also becomes clearly explained on the same basis
When, in regard to anything, there is no such determinate judgment, the fact of its being denoted by the word ‘non-cow’ becomes clearly perceived
The cow and the non-cow are both well-established,—as there are distinct determinate judgments in regard to both; it is only the word that is not well-established; and hence it is applied according to the speaker’s whim.—As a matter of fact, a distinct thing does not need for its apprehension, the apprehension of another thing; hence there is no room here for the charge of ‘mutual interdependence’
As a matter of fact, verbal cognition, not taking cognizance of any external object, apprehends its own mark as something external, on account of strong illusion.—This is all that is done by words; and words do not even, touch the object; nor is any object denoted as qualified by Apoha. 
As for the statement made by the author of the lakṣaṇa—that ‘words express things qualified by the exclusion of other things’, what it means is as follows
Those things that are qualified by the exclusion of other things,—either as their cause or their instruments—are definitely cognised as not mixed up with things of other kinds. The word expresses these things. and, because it brings about the cognition apprehending those things, there is denial of the ‘universal’ and such other commonalities
Those things however which appear in the cognition—these internal (subjective) things the word denotes directly; and the fact of these things being qualified by ‘exclusion’ has just been explained
When it is said that ‘a certain portion of the thing is apprehended by the exclusion of other things’,—it is the said reflection that is meant
It is spoken of as a portion of the object, because it proceeds on the basis of the perception of the object as ‘excluded from other things’, and because it is superimposed upon the object
As before, the instrumental ending may signify either the cause or the instrument. or it may signify that it is ‘in that form’.—If the thing were not differentiated from unlike things, then it could not be so
What is meant by (the cow) being ‘different’ is only the ‘exclusion of the non-cow’; and this exclusion is of the nature of that same difference.—Even when the difference has been asserted, the thing itself does not entirely disappear. Thus even when it has the nature of the qualification, the cognition of the thing does not cease. even when there is non-difference, the qualification is there as a creation of fancy. That character, having been withdrawn therefrom, has been placed there as if different; whereby it becomes its qualification, like the stick and other things
Discriminators of truth declare that what is denoted by the word is mere ‘reflection’. People, not knowing the distinction between what is ‘perceived’ and what is ‘fancied’ regard it to be something ‘external—as that is what is apprehended (by words), individuals are denoted by words.—In reality however there is nothing that is denoted by words,—as has been proved already
Thus, individuals being denoted by words, they are also capable of being ‘excluded’. As regards the universal, there can be no ‘exclusion even if there were ‘exclusion’ of it, it could not have the character of the ‘entity’
Negation is not ‘excluded’ (denied) in the words ‘negation is not negation’; it is however clearly ‘excluded’ (denied) in such expressions as ‘the entity is not of the nature of negation’
When one thing is not of the nature of another, it is called its ‘Apoha’ (exclusion, negation), and the entity is not of the nature of negation. but even though there is ‘Apoha’ of negation, it does not acquire the character of the positive entity
Even though it is urged that ‘things are not produced by primordial matter or god and so forth’,—the character of being produced by primordial matter, god and so forth does not become a positive entity
Thus then there is no such calamity as that of the non-existent becoming a positive entity. In fact, even on the establishment of the negation, the existence remains there (in the entity),—and the non-existence (of the negation) becomes established thereby
The cow, which is ‘the negation of the non-cow’ is held to be a positive entity, and of a character different from that of the non-cow; but by this the non-cow does not become the cow, for me
Even in regard to non-entities, there can be impressions, created only by the mind (cognitions),—just as in the case of things of various kinds created by imagination. This diversity among Apohas, as also their positive character, would be assumed on the basis of the diversity among impressions; just as in the case of creations of imagination
Just as we have explained the fact of ‘the exclusion of other things’ being denoted by words,—exactly in the same manner should be understood the ‘exclusion of other words’ also
Inasmuch as the Apohas are apprehended as ‘things’ they cannot be regarded as non-entities; this is well known and admitted as pertaining to the illusory aspect of things. as regards the real aspect, what the opponent seeks to prove is accepted by us already
In reality, there can be nothing that can be either denoter or denoted,—as all things being in perpetual flux, no concomitance is possible
If it is the illusory relation of denoter and denoted that is denied; on the basis of the real fact of the two exclusions being non-entities,—even so, ‘falsity’ becomes unavoidable; in view of such words and things denoted by them as are the creation of imagination
As a matter of fact, there is ho ‘universal’ (commonalty) in the case of the things in question, which could be denoted; nor is there any universal word denotative of that universal; nor does the denotative character belong to the word, as specific individualities are all in perpetual flux
Hence both of these should be held to consist in the illusory ‘reflection’ etc.—Thus in view of these, the ‘falsity’ remains unshaken
For the man by whom the denotation of words is not admitted to be anything positive, the mind (cognition) reflecting the thing is what is brought about by the word, and this cognition ultimately brings about the idea of the thing. When words express their meanings, there is, by implication, the exclusion of other things; and through the presence of this there is negation also, as preceded by the apprehension of the positive thing.— 
The ‘impossibility of the positive’ has been averred oh the ground that such things as the ‘universal’ and the like cannot form the subject of words and determinate conceptions
From the term ‘blue-lotus’, only one thing is cognised,—and that is the reflection excluded (differentiated) from the ‘non-blue’ and the ‘non-lotus’
We do not hold that what the word denotes is the thing endowed with the ‘exclusion (Apoha) of other things’; because for us, there is no ‘exclusion’ other than the thing excluded from something else. Hence the objection that ‘it is dependent upon something else’ is not applicable to the ‘denotation of words’ as honestly explained,—in the way that it is to the theory of the ‘universal’ (being denoted by words). because there is no difference between the relation of qualification and qualified and ‘co-ordination’. Consequently there is no incongruity in the theory that it is Apoha that is denoted by words
When the word ‘blue’ is uttered alone, the particular ‘reflection’ that appears is one that scintillates through all blue things such as the cuckoo, the lotus, the blue bee and the like.—When the word ‘lotus’ is added to it, then the cuckoo, the collyrium and other blue things become ‘excluded’, and the resultant reflection is one that is further particularised and becomes definitely applied to one blue thing only.—Thus the necessary co-ordination is not rendered impossible. All this explanation is absolutely impossible under the theory of the other party
By the single word, the specific individuality becomes expressed in its entirety; and when that has been denoted, why should there be non-cognition of other things,—for the sake of which another word would be pronounced,—when, in reality, the thing has been denoted in its entirety?—If not, then it becomes more than one
If the universal ‘blue’, or the quality blue, is denoted by the word ‘blue’, then the word ‘lotus’ (pronounced with that word) should denote another universal ‘lotus’;—such being the case, there would be difference between the two words, just as there is between the words ‘bakula’ (a kind of flower) and ‘utpala’ (lotus); so that any co-ordination, etc. between them will be all the more impossible
If it is the substance related to the quality and the universal that is denoted by the word ‘blue’, then the word ‘lotus’ would be useless. as what is related to the said two factors (quality and universal) is exactly what is equipped with the universal ‘lotus’; and as this will have been already expressed by the word ‘blue’, the word ‘lotus’ would be useless
If what belongs to the universal ‘lotus’ is different from what is related to the quality and universal (blue),—then the words ‘blue’ and ‘lotus’ cannot be co-substrate (co-ordinated)
If the word ‘blue’ does not denote the substance related to the quality and the universal (blue) as related to the universal ‘lotus’,—then the substance as related to the universal ‘lotus’ should be something totally different; as a matter of fact, what is related to the universal ‘lotus’ is that same substance that is related to the other two (quality and universal ‘blue’); and that substance has already been expressed, in its entirety—not in part,—by the word ‘blue’,—and has also been apprehended by the verbal cognition brought about by that word;—so that the word ‘lotus’ would be entirely useless
If (it be said that), in regard to a thing devoid of plurality, the assumption of the alternatives of ‘entirety’ and ‘severality’ (‘plurality’) is not possible,—bitch an assertion could only proceed from ignorance of the meaning of the sentence (used by us), what we made clear was that the first word ‘blue’ itself expressed all that had to be expressed, and no part of itself was left (unexpressed). 
In this same way, the tittering of other words also would be fruitless. in fact, the utterance of such words would only mean so many synonyms
For us, no external thing is expressed by the word; nor is any idea of external things held to proceed from words,—by virtue of which, the thing in its entirety having been taken up by these two, any subsequent word would be a mere synonym of that word
What is produced by the word, in due course, is only the reflection; and it is through delusion that this appears as one and as external. The co-ordination and other relations are due to the reflection. In reality, all these words are held to be objectless
As for the connection of gender and number, it is not present in individuals also; in fact, such connection is based entirely upon conventions set up by the whims of people; it is nothing real
There are three words (denoting the same thing)—‘taṭaḥ’ (masculine) ‘taṭam’ (neuter) and ‘taṭī’ (feminine); and yet any one thing cannot have three forms; for if it did, then, all cognitions would have to be variegated in character
If they were dependent upon the speaker’s whim, then the cognitions would not envisage the things at all. under that whim, the cognitions should be of one form, and yet the thing is not of one form
If the application of the genders were based upon the states of continuance, appearance and destruction,—then, all the three genders would become applicable to all things
There are three words used (in connection with non-entities)—‘abhāvaḥ’ (masculine), ‘nirupākhyam’ (neuter) and ‘tucchatā’ (feminine); what sort of connection with the states of continuance, etc. could be assumed in regard to the nonentities (spoken of by these words)? 
Of things,—‘appearance’ is birth; ‘destruction’ is perishing; and ‘continuance’ is the thing in its own form. now in birth there is no perishing; why then is it spoken of as ‘utpattiḥ’ (feminine)? Nor is there existence in its own form; why then is it spoken of as ‘janma’ (neuter)? In destruction also, the other two states are not there; why then is it spoken of as ‘tirobhāvaḥ’ (masculine), ‘nāśaḥ’ (masculine) and ‘tirobhavanam’ (neuter)? As regards continuance also, on what ground is it spoken of as ‘sthitiḥ’ (feminine) and ‘svabhāvaḥ’ (masculine)?—If the form of these is not differentiated, then they should always be in one and the same gender
If the feminine and the rest be held to be so many different universals,—then all such should be regarded as discarded by the rejection of the ‘universal’ itself
Such words are applied to particular universals, as ‘jātiḥ’ (feminine), ‘bhāvaḥ’ (masculine) and ‘sāmānyam’ (neuter). nor is it possible for universals to subsist in other universals themselves
How too can there be such words as ‘abhāvaḥ’ (masculine), ‘nirupākhyam’ (neuter) and ‘tucchatā’ (feminine)?—From all this it follows that the entire scheme of three genders is purely conventional
Number also is purely conventional, and is assumed through the whim of the speaker, even when there is discrimination between difference and non-difference; as is found in the case of words like ‘dārā’ (wife), etc. and ‘vipina’ (forest), etc
If words like ‘dārāḥ’ are used in reference to the individual as well as the universal, it is so applicable on the basis of the number of either individuals or the components.—The word ‘vana’ denotes either individuals as qualified by the number of the universal, or the universal as subsisting in a plurality of individuals.”—[Ślokavārtika-Vanavāda 92-94] 
In this way all words in the singular number become doomed.—If it be argued that “in the case of other words (in the singular number) the speaker’s wish does not lie that way”,—then that wish itself might be the basis in the cases in question also
There can be no number in the universal at all.—Even if the number were there in the universal, how could the individuals be qualified by that number?—“[They could be so qualified] through the connection of what is connected (indirectly), or through direct connection itself”.—[If this be held then the answer would be as in the following text] 
If it be so, then even a single tree could be spoken of as ‘vana’ (forest); several trees also are spoken of as such only through connection, and that is present in the single tree also
That (universal) which subsists in the many individual trees is the same that subsists in the single individual (tree),—the basis thereof being the same in both oases; consequently, the idea of ‘vana’ (forest) should be there in connection with the single tree also
Thus the use of words in the singular and other numbers should be regarded through concomitance and non-concomitance, as depending entirely upon the speaker’s whim,—not upon the real state of things; as it is not always in accordance with this latter
The connection of action, time, etc. has been already rejected before. Hence all these also are purely conventional, and do not really subsist in individuals also
In fact, the Apoha is denoted as apprehended in the form of the individual; and the Apoha therefore is connected with gender, etc. through that individual
The word is used only for the purpose of bringing about the cognition of the thing intended; hence the ‘exclusion of what is not-intended’ becomes apprehended by implication
All things cannot be desired; as, in that case, there would be no restriction regarding any denotations. Hence in the case of words like ‘cooks’ and the like, there is clearly ‘something excluded’
When the verb ‘pacati’ (‘cooks’) is uttered, what is understood is that ‘he is not doing nothing,—nor is he eating or gambling’—where the ‘exclusion of other acts’ is clearly apprehended. Thus, whatever is intended (to be spoken), there is always something ‘excluded’ by the ‘relative negation’,—this something being ‘doing nothing’ and also other acts (than the one meant to be spoken of by the verb used)
Your assertion that “the cooking remains un-negatived in its own form” involves self-contradiction; because the words ‘in its own form’ can only mean that ‘there is negativing of the form of other acts’; otherwise the emphasising would be meaningless
Apoha being featureless, what sort of ‘accomplishment’ could there be of it? Certainly there is no ‘accomplishment’ of the ‘sky-lotus’ etc.—If it be urged that “inasmuch as it is apprehended as a thing, it appears as with features”,—then (we ask) what if it is so?—[It may be said that] “From this it would follow that it has the same properties as entities.” 
Thus then, the notion of ‘being accomplished’, as also the conception of the ‘past’ etc.,—being of the same form as positive entities—comes to be based upon that same
In the case of all such denotations as the injunction and the like,—what is ‘excluded’ (negatived) is ‘non-existence’, etc.,—exactly that which is not meant to be spoken of; but this is done by implication,—not directly by the word
Of similar kind would be the Apoha, when a negative is joined with another negative; just as it is apprehended when there are four negatives. in some cases, when a negative is associated with another negative, what is apprehended from it is something positive; the third negative expresses the negation (absence) of that positive thing; and when for the negativing of that again a fourth negative is used, if that is meant to be spoken of, what is denoted by it is the ‘exclusion of another’
When it is said ‘nāsau na pacati’ (‘it is not that he does not cook’) what is understood is that ‘he cooks’; if a third negative is added, what is understood is either that ‘he is doing nothing’ or that ‘he is doing something other than cooking’;—and when a fourth negative is added, what is understood is something differentiated from this last, that is, ‘he is cooking’. So that here the ‘exclusion of another’ is similar to that in the case of the affirmative sentence
Of particles like ‘ca’ the meaning intended is something like ‘combination’; and thus there would be ‘exclusion’ by that, of things other than that, in the shape of ‘option’ and the like
The exclusion of others’ is clearly understood in the case of the meaning of a sentence. it is only the denotations of certain words construed together that is spoken of as ‘the meaning of the sentence’; what would be ‘excluded’ by these words would clearly be the things different from those denoted by these words; so that the same would be ‘excluded’ by the meaning of the sentence also. Because the meaning of the sentence is nothing apart from the meanings of the words (composing it)
What is regarded by dull-witted persons as open to doubt is what is ‘excluded’ by the word in question; otherwise, the utterance of the word would be useless.—If he does not regard anything as open to doubt, then why does he ask (another person) about it?—If one utters a word that does not bring about embellishment (enlightenment),—how can he be regarded as a sane-minded person? 
When it is asserted that ‘colour is cognisable by visual perception’—this certainly serves to ‘exclude’ (deny) something supposed by some person
The supposition is]—“It is not by the cognition through the eye alone that the blue and other colours are cognisable,—but also by the one eternal cognition, through the ear also.” 
That words like ‘knowable’, ‘cognisable’ serve as the means of producing cognitions (ideas) having been perceived only when they appear in a sentence,—if, at some other time? They are found to be used alone by themselves, the idea that is produced by them, in regard to things that are nebulous, is in accordance with what has been found in the case of their use in a sentence.—In fact, in the case of words like ‘jar’ also, it is the same; so that the words ‘knowable’ and the like are just like the words ‘jar’ and the rest
The statement that, “rather than assume the ‘excluded’ thing it is far better to assume the thing itself”, is self-contradictory; as in every case there is ‘exclusion of some other thing’, that thing alone is assumed which is meant to be spoken of; hence there is implication of that which is meant to be spoken of; but all things are not meant to be spoken of
As for the denial of the idealistic form of things,—such denial is impossible because the fact is self-evident; as actually there are several impositions without any basic reality.—It has to be admitted that there must be something in the idea (or cognition) itself which appertains specifically to each object envisaged by it; and that is precisely its ‘nature’;—and this same ‘nature’ of the idea has been spoken of by us as ‘form ‘reflected image’, ‘appearance’, ‘figuring’, ‘manifestation so that there is only a difference in the name, without any real difference
In the case of the word ‘evam’ (thus), there is ‘naivam’ (not thus) which is clearly ‘excluded’; in the sense of ‘in another manner’
In the case of the word ‘all’ also, as presented in actual usage, there is something ‘excluded’; and what is regarded as meant to be spoken of here also is the ‘exclusion of others 
All things are soulless’, ‘all men are gone’,—in such sentences, what is apprehended is entirety, and what is ‘excluded’ is a certain factor
1186) There are such misconceptions as—‘only external things like, the jar are soulless’, ‘only some men can go’; and it is these that are ‘excluded’
In the case of the word ‘all’, the negation of all parts is not what is meant to be spoken of; hence the incongruity of the ‘exclusion of its own meaning’ that has been urged has been so under ignorance
It is neither positive nor negative; it is neither diverse nor same; it is neither subsistent, nor non-subsistent; it is neither one nor many
In reality, it does not exist in the form in which it is apprehended; hence it cannot be positive. nor is it negative, as it is apprehended as an entity
Diversity’ (difference) and ‘sameness’ (non-difference), etc. are resident in entities; while the ‘denotation of words’ is entirely featureless; hence the said characters have no place here
For us the word does the ‘negativing of other things’ directly; and after the negativing has been done by the word, it becomes apprehended through its own force,—in the form ‘its nature is not the nature of anything else’,—as has been explained in detail (under text 1013); hence what is urged on the present occasion—‘who has attributed the character of the non-cow to the cow, that it has to be negatived?—Is through ignorance of the view of the other party. As a matter of fact, this is not what is held to be ‘negatived’ by the word directly
The ‘denotability’ that you ask about—is ‘denotability’ by which word? Is it ‘denotability’ by the word ‘Apoha’? Or by the wobd ‘jar’ and the best?—As regards the question—whether the Apoha that is denoted is itself of the nature of Apoha (negation, exclusion) or it is something positive,—when we come to think of it, what is cognised is the apoha that figures in the cognition.—Our view is that what is denoted by the word directly is the reflected image,—and as regards ‘the negation of other things’, like the universal etc.,—That is comprehended only indirectly, through implication.—What all such words as ‘jar’, ‘tree’ and the like denote is the said reflected image, as it is the cognition of this that they produce directly; and anything else, they imply only indirectly.—Thus then, there is no incongruity regarding the positive character; nor is there anything undesirable for us.—As regards the alternative of Apoha not being ‘denotable’,—that we do not accept; and hence that is not our view
The ideas of ‘one-ness’, ‘eternality’ and the like are purely imaginary, not real. hence your laughter at us on this point is indicative of a very high grade of learning (on your part)! 
Even in cases where the thing itself is apprehended, the ‘exclusion of other things’ is also apprehended,—as is indicated by the force of the emphasising term (used by you); if it were not, then, the emphasising would be useless
In the case of such terms as ‘son of the barren woman—where there is no external object which would be the ‘contrary’ (excluded),—wherein would the Apoha subsist which is said to be denoted by it?” 
As non-entities have no form, words appertaining to those cannot be even suspected of being denotative of the universal and such things. in fact, it has been fully established that they are only indicators of the reflection
What is expressed by words is only the reflection that appears, as created solely by impressions made by objectless (empty) conceptions
The words in question are directly expressive of that (reflection) alone,—because they are dependent upon convention,—like words expressing imaginary things
These words are not denotative of the ‘specific individuality’ and the rest, that have been assumed by others. Hence these should be understood to be like those just mentioned
That there can be no convention in regard toé specific individuality’ and the rest has been already -proved before. hence the reasons adduced are neither ‘doubtful’ nor ‘concomitant with the contrary of the probandum 
Under the theory of Apoha also, how is convention possible?—How too is it fruitful?—When it cannot be known to both, the speaker and the listener; as the idea of one cannot be known to the other. what too was seen at the time of the making of the convention is not seen at the time of the use of the word.” 
Even though each person is cognisant of what appears to himself, yet there is something in the cognition of external things which is common to both persons
Just as the man whose eye has been attacked by a disorder says to another like himself that ‘there are two moons’,—so also is all verbal usage
The concomitance of the convention has been accepted only on the basis of the notions of men; in fact, all cognitions brought about by words are ultimately false
The concomitance of the convention has been accepted only on the basis of the notions of men; in fact, all cognitions brought about by words are ultimately false
The sense-perception and the inference, which others have put forward, in proof of their concepts,—are not acceptable. they are of the nature described below
The sense-perception and the inference, which others have put forward, in proof of their concepts,—are not acceptable. they are of the nature described below
Sense-perception is free from conceptual content and not erroneous.—‘Conceptual content’ is idea associated with verbal expression; it is not [regarded as] the basis of verbal expression, etc
As a matter of fact, the cognition that is capable of connecting the thing and the word always appears as associated with verbal expression (words),—even when the words-like ‘tree’ and the like—are not actually used
Through the continuance of the impression left by the constant associating of the thing and its name during past lives,—even the new-born infant becomes capable of activity, by reason of the said conceptual content
That which is clearly cognised at the time of reflection and imagination as if interpenetrating them,—cannot be set aside by mere words
The connection between words and things, due to conceptual content, is illusory; hence as it cannot be based upon anything else,—if there were no conceptual content, the said connection, even as it is, would not be possible
Some people have regarded the conceptual content to be that which is capable of being connected with the universal and the rest;—that view cannot be right, as the universal, etc. have all been rejected, and they are never perceived
The universal and the rest being never perceived,—and their connection being never manifested,—how can their association with things be possible,—as between milk and water, etc.? 
Two kinds of conceptual content have been mentioned in the two assertions, in order to set forth the two views that have been held by persons belonging to our own party and by those belonging to other parties,—in order to show which is to be accepted and which to be rejected 
This ‘connection with name, etc.’ remains there after having indicated its own immediate cause; hence the assertion is not irrelevant
Name, universal and all the rest are connected by the said conceptual content; hence what is spoken of (by Diṅnāga’s definition) is the same conceptual content which has been described as ‘the idea associated with verbal expression’
Or, what has been spoken of (in the definition in question) is the same conceptual content that we have ourselves asserted;this interpretation) being based upon the fact that in all cases things are spoken of by their name (this being the meaning of the compound ‘nāmādiyojanā’)
It is through these that the instrumental ending becomes useful; so that the meaning comes to be that the conceptual content becomes connected with the name, through the instrumentality of the universal, etc
Inasmuch as there is the universal expressed by the proper name, the explanation should not be regarded as not applicable to it. It has been mentioned separately only in view of popular usage
Inasmuch as the ‘exclusion (Apoha) of others’ is the only denotation of words, all words should be ‘common’ only. or, inasmuch as they are dependent upon the speaker’s whim, they should all be ‘proper’ only.” 
It is true that what the professor of the science of reasoning has said is in accordance with the popular idea of things; as it is only on these lines that verbal usage actually proceeds
The said ‘universal’ and the rest are nothing different from what is known by these words among people:it was with a view to emphasise this fact, that the statement ‘others etc.’ has been made
Even those who are wedded to the notion that conceptual content consists in ‘connection with the universal and the rest’, have to admit that it is ‘idea associated with words’.—Otherwise, just as the two connected things are non-existent, so their connection also would be non-existent,—all things being conceived severally each by itself; and there would be no need for postulating the ‘conceptual content and the result of this would be that there would be no usage in the world; because usage has been regarded as associated with the universal and the rest,—and association with the universal and the rest is inseparable from association with words. thus alone could the expression ‘spoken of’ used by the teacher be fruitful
Thus ‘conceptual content’ is something that can be easily proved without effort, as there is no dispute regarding it among teachers who take their stand upon all true doctrines
It was in view of all this that the assertion of ‘name, universal and the rest’ was made; and herein the teacher made mention of his own view as also the view of others; without indicating the difference by actually saying that ‘my own view is so and so’, it was for this reason that he subsequently added the statement that ‘others have held, etc.’
Thus in this way is the passage from the nyāyamukha to be explained, by mentioning the ‘cognition it is the ‘idea associated with words’ that has been indicated
Or, the term ‘viśeṣaṇa’ [‘qualifying adjunct’, as occurring in the passage quoted from the Nyāyamukha, on p. 372, bottom] may be taken as standing for ‘differentiation’, ‘exclusion—by virtue of which words bring about the ‘Apoha, exclusion, of others’; [it is called ‘differentiation’] because it does the differentiating (or excluding) of the universal, etc
Conceptual content being held to be as actually understood and described above, it is the denial of the sameness of this with sense-perception that has been asserted; and this is not inconsistent with the fact of its being spoken of by such words as ‘adhyakṣa’ (‘pratyakṣa’) and the like. In sense-perception there is absence of conceptual content, but ‘conceptual content’ is not the same as ‘expressed by words otherwise, colour, odour and the rest would become determinate (as they are ‘expressed by words’).—Thus there is no room for what the dull-witted persons have urged.—If the word ‘sense-perception’ actually denotes sense-perception, then how can its being said to be ‘free from conceptual content’ be held to be improper? 
That sense-perception is ‘free from conceptual content’ is recognised very clearly; since it is found that even when one has his mind attracted by something else, he has the perception of the blue colour and other things through his senses
This same conceptual content does not apprehend the said object; because if it did, it would abandon the expressing of the ‘past’, etc. and there would be the incongruity of its being connected with the name of that object
At the particular time, there is no other conceptual content which is associated with the name of that object; because there is no recognition of any such perceptible conceptual content, and the simultaneous presence of both cannot be desirable
As a matter of fact, what makes the cognition determinate appears along with the cognition itself; hence the cognition brought about by the senses is clearly non-determinate (free from conceptual content)
If it be held that “cognitions appear in succession (never simultaneously), and the idea of simultaneous appearance is due to the quickness of the succession; as in the case of the whirling fire-brand”—[then the answer is as stated in the following text]
What has been asserted is that there is no perceptible conceptual content which is associated with the name of the object before the man’s eyes
That the said idea (of the simultaneity or the other conceptual content and the cognition) [cannot] be wrong has just been made clear. and this same simultaneity between the object and the cognition is also quite clear for that same reason
In the state of things attending upon the watching of the dancing girl, the whole lot sensations is apprehended at one and the same time, even though there are many intervening factors. If this also were regarded as a mistake due to the quick succession in which the sensations appear,—then (the answer is that) there is still quicker succession in the case of cognitions produced by the two words ‘latā’ and ‘tāla’ when pronounced together; why then is there no idea of simultaneity in this case?—Then in a case where the operations of the mind alone are concerned, no succession should be perceived, because all cognitions (mental operations) occur in quick succession and do not stay for any length of time. So that in all these oases (of quick succession), no succession could be perceived. The notion of simultaneous cognition however would be there, just as in the case of perception of sound, etc. (in the case of the dancing girl)
In the case of the whirling fire-brand, the illusion of simultaneity appears in the form of the circle; this notion of the circle is not due to the connecting of the various perceptions of the fire-brand as it is whirled round; because the (continuous) circular form is clearly perceived. In fact, the said connecting of the various perceptions could be done only by remembrance, not by direct perception; as no perception can apprehend what is past and gone.—The object also of the remembrance could not be very clear, as it has already disappeared; for this same reason, the appearance of the circle also could not be very clear (if it were due to the remembrance of the many cognitions)
Or again, when there is no basis for the existence of a thing in a certain form,—that thing in that form is not admitted as real, by the wise. For instance, the white horse is not admitted to be the cow because the dewlap and the other features of the cow are not present in the horse. In the case of sense-perception there is no reason for the presence of the determinate character (the character of being associated with conceptual content), which could bring about the apprehension of the thing along with its properties.—Spotted and other cows are instances to the contrary. If it were not so, it would lead to absurd contingencies.—The reason adduced cannot be said to be ‘unproven’ (or not-admitted); as the universal and other qualifying factors have all been rejected. Nor are the properties cognised as apart from those factors. Nor are there any such properties
The name also, which would be the ‘specific individuality’ of the word, can never be denotative; as the idea of the ‘specific individuality’ being the denotes or the denoted has been already rejected.—It is for this reason that the idea of the denoter and denoted has been regarded as something superimposed (upon things);—while what one apprehends by sense-perception is something which is not superimposed; because this perception is there only when the ‘specific individuality’ is there,—and it is not there when the specific individuality is not there—through the intervention of something else or some such reason
The nature of the blue and other things, being individually specific, is incapable of having any convention in regard to it; the perception of these things, therefore, cannot be associated with words
Name (universal) and the rest may not be the distinguishing properties perceived, in the object (op sense-perception);—even so, the reason put forward does not cease to be inadmissible; because if there is no apprehension of the thing as distinguished from other things, then, there would either be an apprehension of the thing by itself only, or no apprehension at all; as in the case of the jar,—if there is no apprehension of the jar as distinguished from other jars, then there is either apprehension of the jar by itself alone, or no apprehension of the jar at all.” 
If perception is regarded as apprehending the thing as distinguished from other apprehensible things,—then this cognition would be conceptual (determinate), just like the cognition of the tree and other things.” 
There is no particular (or individual) without a touch of the universal. if this is not touched in the apprehension, then the particular, becoming devoid of being, cannot be apprehended.” 
The assertion that the cognition apprehends a qualified thing, and yet it is not conceptual implies great temerity indeed! certainly, no ‘qualification’ is possible except through connection with qualifications.” 
When the cognition is held to apprehend the qualified thing,—it is by reason of its apprehending the thing as differentiated from other homogeneous and heterogeneous things,—and not of the connection of qualifications
What is meant by ‘being qualified’ (distinguished) is ‘difference”—not the connection of qualifications. but the idea also that ‘this is different’ is not cognised as associated with words
It is only after the thing has been apprehended as the ‘negation of all things other than itself’,—that there appears the conceptual cognition in the said form
Other people regard.the universal as not distinguished by qualifications,—which universal they regard as apprehended by non-conceptual perception. what has been urged is applicable to that also
The universal is recognised as ‘distinguished’ from the particular; hence the perception of it would have to be regarded (under the opponent’s contention) as conceptual
A thing is called ‘universal’ when it is apprehended without distinction; hence it is not right to regard the universal as something distinguished from the particular.” 
When these (particulars) are cognised as similar or dissimilar, they indicate the existence in themselves, of the character of the ‘universal’ or the ‘particular’.” 
If the said ‘similarity’ and ‘dissimilarity’ are held to be differentiated, then the fact of the universal being distinguished from the particulars remains as before.—If, on the other hand, they are not held to be differentiated, then, how can the clearly marked division be possible, without crossing each other? there is no other way in which they could be conceived
Of the particular things there is no other characteristic except that of being ‘particular’ (or ‘distinct’); how then can there be any apprehension of them which does not envisage the ‘distinct’ form? Even if their forms are envisaged, they are apprehended only as distinct from other particulars; so that their perception would be ‘conceptual’
The universal is cognised as ‘distinguished’ (distinct) from the featureless thing; hence for you, it should be cognisable by conceptual perception.—If it be urged that “the universal cannot be regarded as distinguished from a non-entity”,—then (we ask) is it of the same nature as the non-entity? if not, then why is it not admitted that it is ‘distinguished’ from it? 
As a matter of fact, in the case of the entity also, being ‘distinguished’ consists in not being that same; and as the universal is not the same as the non-entity, why can you not regard it as being ‘distinguished’ from the non-entity? From all this it follows that whatever cognition appears in regard to the ‘specific individuality’ of things appertains to what is beyond the range of words and is hence non-conceptual
At first there is only a pre-cognition, which is non-conceptual, like the cognition of the infant and the dumb and the like;—it is born purely of the thing (cognised); at that moment, neither the universal nor the particular character is apprehended; all that is apprehended is only a certain individual which is the substratum of both those characters
Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 112-113).—Subsequently, the thing becomes apprehended along with the properties of the ‘class-character’ and the rest; and the cognition also by which it is thus apprehended is regarded as ‘sense-perception’
Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 120).”. 
Again and again, as more and more conceptual contents come in, there follow further apprehensions, in connection with the same; and all this is regarded as ‘sense-perceptionślokavārtika—sense-perception, 125)
When a man returns from bright light into an inner room, things do not manifest themselves to him immediately upon his entrance; but that does not mean that later on he does not perceive those things by his sense-organs.”Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 126)
Just as, in the first instances, he perceives a mere semblance of the thing and subsequently he perceives them in their true form,—so also with the properties of ‘class-character’ and the rest.”Ślokavartika—sense-perception, 127)
If after having pre-cognised the thing, the man closes his eyes and then imposes conceptual contents,—this latter would not be ‘sense-perception’;—because it is not in accordance with the connection (op the sense-organs).”Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 128)
What has been urged is not right. if the cognition in question appertains to the specific individuality of the thing,—then, even on the apprehension of the universal and other properties, it should remain free from verbal expression. because it has been proved before that the specific individuality of things cannot be denoted by words; hence the cognition that rests upon that must be free from conceptual content (and association with words)
If the universal alone were apprehended, then the qualification (property) would be something- absolutely distinct; and this is not what is acceptable to the other party, as asserted (by himself)
If the qualification were absolutely distinct from the qualified, then how could it bring about in the qualified a cognition in keeping with itself?”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 142]
One and the same cognition cannot comprehend both the specific individuality and the universal; because, if such a cognition were ‘conceptual’, there could be no comprehension of the former,—on the other hand, if it were otherwise, there could be no comprehension of the latter
On account of there being no absolute distinction (between the universal and the specific individuality),—if the universal and other properties have become already apprehended by the initial cognition,—then the subsequent cognition would be apprehending only what has been already apprehended,—and it would thus be like remembrance
At the initial stage), there is only a vague idea of several universals, and there is no definite idea of anything; the definite idea comes only later; as this apprehends the thing as differentiated from all impositions (doubts and misconceptions). Just as inference apprehends the object as differentiated from impositions, so also does the (later) definite cognition.” 
As a matter of pact, the validity of inferential cognition does not rest upon its apprehending a thing differentiated from impositions; if that were so, then remembrance also would have to be regarded as valid. What really happens is that after the sense-perception (of a certain thing) there appear certain impositions (doubts and misconceptions), and it is by reason of setting aside these impositions that inferential-cognition has been regarded as valid.—This is not possible for you; because in the case of such cognitions as ‘the white—cow—walking’—after the sense-perception, no imposition is found to appear, which could be negatived (by the subsequent valid cognition)
As a matter of fact, universal and the rest do not exist, either as non-different, or as different, from (individuals),—by virtue of which the conceptual cognition of those could have the character of ‘perception’
a) [They cannot be the same as the individuals] because there is no comprehensiveness. (b) [Nor can they be different from the individuals] because they do not appear as different from the individual
c) [Nor can they be both different and non-different] because difference and non-difference always remain mutually exclusive
As a matter of fact, even the non-conceptual perception has the potency to bring about the conceptual content; hence through that, it becomes a factor in all activity
The non-conceptual cannot bring about the conceptual content,a) because their objects are different,—as in the case of the cognition of colour, etc.,—and also because it is non-conceptual—like the eye, etc.” 
There is no incompatibility between the conceptual content and the said reasons; nor is there difference in their objects; as the object apprehended by the one is the same as that apprehended by the other
In reality, the conceptual content proceeds without any objective basis; it has no object at all, which could differ from anything else
Among the cognitions of colour, sound, etc., mutual causal relation is actually present; hence the instance that has been cited is one in which the probandum is not known to exist
Inasmuch as between the cognition of fire and the cognition of smoke, there is the relation of cause and effect,—the same could be possible in the case in question also; hence the reason cited is found to be inconclusive also
The epithet ‘not-erroneous’ has been added for the purpose of excluding such illusions as those of the ‘keśoṇḍraka’[1] (hair-tuft) and the like; as these are not regarded as ‘valid cognition’ on the ground of their being ‘erroneous’
Some people have held that illusion is purely mental. but that is not so; as it is pound to appear only when the sense-organ is present (and operative) and to cease when this latter (becomes disordered, ceases). If it were purely mental, it should cease like the illusion regarding a serpent, even when the disorder of the sense-organ has not ceased; and yet it continues to be perceived quite clearly
a) as regards the reason that ‘the illusion is there only when the sense-organ is there’,—in its direct sense, it is-inadmissible; and in its indirect sense, it is inconclusive; as it is present in remembrance also
b) as regards the reason ‘illusion is an aberration brought about by the disorder of the sense-organ’,—that is clearly found also in the case of effects produced indirectly,—for example, in the case of the mule and such things
c) as regards the idea’ that ‘all mental illusions cease after reflection’,—this also is not quite true (inconclusive), in view of such ideas as-‘entity’ and ‘universal’. If it be held that these notions do cease on the subsequent notion that ‘these are not found in the specific individuality of things’,—then the answer is that such cessation is possible also in the case of such illusions as that of ‘two moons’.—If it be urged that the existence of these does not cease—then, the same may be said in regard to the notions of the universal, etc, also—as regards the illusions regarding god and such other beings, appearing in persons who are bent upon believing in them, there is no cessation at all, even on listening to millions of reasons; in fact, these dull-witted persons declare that these reasons are no reasons at all.” 
The idea of the illusion being there when the sense-organ is there cannot be said to be ‘inadmissible’, in its direct sense. Because there is no intervention by any unmistaken (right) notion; as no such intervening right notion is ever apprehended.—Even when the man has his mind not turned to other things, he has the continuous perception of ‘two moons’; which shows that the production (of the illusion, by the sense-organ) is not indirect—as regards the ideas of ‘entity’, ‘universal’ and so forth,—where there is the possibility of their being retracted,—cessation is quite possible, if the person so wishes. So also in the case of the idea relating to god
There are others who declare that—“notions like ‘the yellow conch-shell’, even though illusory, are valid,—inasmuch as they are not in con gruent with effective action.” 
This cannot be right the effective action available is not in keeping with the form apprehended. otherwise there would be incongruities; as in the cognition where there is appearance of the hair and such things, there is compatibility, though only with the light (which is not apprehended) and other details; hence the validity of this would be irresistible (under the opponent’s view)
There can re no shape apart from the colour; and with the apparent colour, there is no compatibility (in the case in question)
If, without regard to the form of things, validity were presumed on the ground of mere compatibility with fruitful action,—then how would this not contradict such assertions (of yours) as that ‘the definite cognition of the thing is in the form of the thing’?—as regards the possibility of ‘compatibility’ (in the case of the notion of the ‘yellow conch-shell’), that can only be the result of the impression (of a previous cognition). 
The reasoning that is used in proving the non-conceptual character of the cognitions produced by the mental sense-organ, also serves to prove the non-conceptual character of the sensations of pleasure, etc
They (pleasure, etc.) are non-apprehensive of another thing; how then can they carry their own cognisance with them? In fact, they become cognisable only by the cognition which subsists in the same substratum as themselves”.—If this is urged—[then the answer is as in the following texts]
As a matter of fact, pleasure, etc. are felt immediately after the perception of the external object; why is it that they are always felt at that same time?—It is regarded as cognised by mental perception; but this perception is not there at the time; as cognitions have been described as appearing in succession (not at the same time).—If it be urged that “it is only simultaneous birth of cognitions that is not admitted, not their simultaneous existence”,—then the answer is that there can be no (continued) existence of anything; as all things have been proved to be momentary.—If it be urged that “there is an illusion of simultaneity, due to the quick succession of the cognitions”,—this also has been rejected already.—If the pleasure, etc., were amenable only to remembrance, then the feeling could not be vivid (as it is).—If it be assumed that the said illusion is in the form of ‘agreeable’ and ‘disagreeable’,—then it comes to this that the existence of pleasure and pain rests in themselves (and they are thus self-cognised).—When the mystics cognise, by sense-perception, the pleasure, etc. of other persons,—then, on account of the similarity of experience, they would themselves be unhappy (at the unhappiness of other people). For you, the feeling of pain consists, not in the existence of the pain itself, but in the cognition of which that pain is the object; and that is another ‘chain’.—The same applies to the inference of another person’s pain also, as inference has been described (by others) as objective (with object), and not purely subjective (not touching objects)
Says Śaṅkarasvāmin]—“Pleasure, etc. are apprehended only as ‘pleasure, etc.’; they are not apprehended as ‘cognition’; consequently like the jar, etc., they cannot be cognition”
If difference is to be accepted on the basis of convention, then cognition itself may not be spoken of as ‘cognition’,—and on the basis of that, cognition would become non-cognition
If it be urged that—“being clearly of the nature of light, it could never be as alleged”,—then, you are faced with this contingency—is not all this the same in the case of pleasure and pain also? As regards the mystic’s cognition, we are going to describe it, on the basis of spotless reasons, as arising out of the contemplation of things and being free from conceptual content and error
The cognition of the object is held to be the ‘fruit’ of the means of cognition,—when the ‘means of cognition’ consists in the ‘sameness of form’ (between the cognition and the cognised);—or apprehension of itself is the fruit, and the means, in this case, consists in ‘capability’
Just as, when the cutting weapon strikes at the Khadira-tree, the resultant cut does not appear in the Palāśa-tree,—in the same way nowhere in the world is the (cutting) axe found to be the same as the cut itself”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 75)
The distinction of ‘cause and effect’ does not rest upon the substratum of that distinction; cognition being formless, the said distinction cannot be possible
Thus then, the (commonly known) distinction (between the cognition as means and cognition as fruit) is purely imaginary,—as in the case of the bow. the distinction cannot be held to be based upon the relation of the producer and produced
When the compact fibre of the wood is rent asunder by the cut of the axe, the axe is (popularly) called the ‘cut’ only when it enters into the fibre; and it is in this way that there is sameness (between the axe and the cut)
When once the distinction has been made,—it may be assumed to be otherwise also;—it is only the form of the distinction that is spoken of in the form of the producer and produced, 
The ‘fruit’ consisting in the apprehension of the object, the character of the ‘means of cognition’ must belong to what goes immediately before it. Hence if the cognition be held to be the ‘means then the ‘fruit’ must be something else.—It cannot be right to attribute the character of the ‘fruit’ to the self-recognition (by the cognition), as this is going to be refuted later on. Nor can it be right to assert that the ‘means’ consists in the form of the object (cognised); as in that case there would be a diversity of objectives”—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 78-79], 
self-recognition’ cannot be denied; as that would involve the incongruity of there being no cognition at all.—Nor can the objectives be different; as ‘self-recognition’ aslo is held to be the cognition of the object
As a matter of fact, the means of cognition must bring about an effect other than itself,—because, it is an active agent,—like the hatchet”;—if this is urged [then the answer is as follows]: The argument is futile; as a different ‘fruit’ has been admitted; and in accordance with reasons already explained (under text 1348), there is no ‘different’ fruit at all.—As regards the means of cognition being an ‘active agent’,—that is not admissible by us, if what is meant by it is that it is productive; if what is meant is that it is the regulator, then there can be no objection to it; and in that case the reason becomes ‘inconclusive’, as it indicates no incongruity
If it be argued that—“the cognition cannot have the same form as the object apprehended,—because it belongs to a different category,—like the cognition of colour, taste, etc.”,—[then the answer is as follows]—in due accordance with our doctrine we have clearly explained this and also other things in course of our rejection of the idea of a real object being apprehended
If there were absolute sameness of form, then cognition would become non-cognition; as for partial sameness of form, that would make every cognition apprehensive of everything
But under the doctrine of the reality of the external world,, the possibility of the sameness of form has to be accepted; that is why it has been mentioned.—Under the doctrine, however, of cognition being a mere reflected image,—even if the cognition differs from the cognised object, the sameness of form belongs to the reflection; and the cognition can be only figurative.—Lastly, for one who does not admit the cognition to be the receptacle of the semblance of the object,—there is not even the said method possible for the cognising of the external object
But under the doctrine of the reality of the external world,, the possibility of the sameness of form has to be accepted; that is why it has been mentioned.—Under the doctrine, however, of cognition being a mere reflected image,—even if the cognition differs from the cognised object, the sameness of form belongs to the reflection; and the cognition can be only figurative.—Lastly, for one who does not admit the cognition to be the receptacle of the semblance of the object,—there is not even the said method possible for the cognising of the external object
Inference is held to be of two kinds, as divided into for one’s own benefit, and (2) for the benefit of others. (1) inference ‘for one’s own benefit’ consists in the cognition of the inferred object derived from the three-featured probans; and (2) inference ‘for the benefit of others’ consists in the statement of the three-featured probans. That probans which has only one or two features (out of the necessary three) is regarded as a ‘semblance of the probans’
Inference is held to be of two kinds, as divided into for one’s own benefit, and (2) for the benefit of others. (1) inference ‘for one’s own benefit’ consists in the cognition of the inferred object derived from the three-featured probans; and (2) inference ‘for the benefit of others’ consists in the statement of the three-featured probans. That probans which has only one or two features (out of the necessary three) is regarded as a ‘semblance of the probans’
The character of the valid probans is round in what is ‘impossible otherwise’,—and not when this condition is not fulfilled, even when the ‘three features’ are present. hence the ‘three-featured’ probans are impotent (infruc-tuous).” 
That which is ‘otherwise impossible’ is held to be the probans, while this is only ‘one-featured’; it may or may not be regarded as ‘four-featured’.” 
Just as among people, the man who has three sons is spoken of as ‘having one son’, on account of the one son being a good son,—so it should be understood in the present instance also.” 
As a matter of fact, the relation of invariable concomitance is not present in the ‘three-featured’ reasons; it is really found only in those reasons which have the one characteristic feature of ‘being otherwise impossible 
That alone is the true probans which has the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’; as for corroborative instances, they may be there, or they may not; as they are not the means. if the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’ is not there, what is the use of the ‘three features? And if the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’ is there, what is the use of the ‘three features’?” 
The reasoning in the form—‘he must be bark, because he is the son of so and so,—like other sons of his who are found to be dark’,—contains the ‘three featured’ probans, and yet it cannot lead to any valid definite conclusion.” 
An example of the one-featured probans without corroborative instances, we have in the reasoning—‘positive and negative entities are essentially existent—because they are capable of being apprehended somehow’.” 
the śaśa-lāñcana (hare-marked) is not non-moon.—Because it is spoken of as the moon’;—here we have a ‘two-featured’ probans
2) Another is thus stated ‘i think that this pain of mine has been caused by the falling insect,—because its appearance was felt on the touch of the falling insect’, ‘in bringing about the effect in the shape of the perception of colour, the eye is endowed with a unique potency,—because it is used for that purpose,—or, because colour is found to be actually perceived by its means ‘the soul, the jar and other things are somehow essentially non-existent,—because they are somehow inapprehensible in any way, like the horns of the hare’
5) ‘Even the hare’s horn and such things are somehow existent,—because they are somehow apprehensible,—just like the soul, the jar and such things’
6) ‘It is understood that your father is in this house,—because your father’s voice is heard in the house’
7) In the case of words, lamps and such things,—it is found that they are actually indicative (of things) through the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’, even though they do not reside in the subject (minor term).—hence for us, it is the ‘one-featured’ probans that should be regarded as the indicative (probans),—on the ground of its being the most important; what is the use of assuming such characters as ‘residing in the subject’ and so forth?” 
Is the proposed definition meant to be general? Or, in reference to a particular subject on which knowledge is sought? Or in reference to the instance? 
If it were understood to be general, then, what would be indicated would be the existence of the probans in the object where the probandum is present; and it would not accomplish what is sought to be accomplished
For instance, ‘visibility’ is known to be inseparable (not existing apart) from ‘destruction’, in a general way; and yet it (visibility) cannot prove it (destruction) in sound.—If, then, it be said that its presence in the object is meant,—then, in that case, under your view also, the probans becomes ‘three-featured’ as before
Being otherwise impossible’ includes positive and negative: concomitance; and by its presence in the object its presence in the minor term becomes admitted
A similar abbreviated definition has been indicated by our teacher also: who says that ‘the probans exists in the cognisable object and is pervaded by a part of it’
If the proposed definition of the probans is meant to be one that is found in the minor term only,—then that same means of cognition which has made the probans known would make known the probandum also. If the probandum does not become known, then the probans also cannot become known. Thus the probans would be useless, the probandum having become known by other means.—There would be the incongruity of ‘mutual interdependence’ also, if the definite cognition of the probandum followed from the probans; and between these two, the cognition of one would be dependent upon the cognition of the other
Even if the probans were known as existent in the corroborative instance, that would not bring about the cognition of the probandum in the minor term. because its invariable concomitance will not have been definitely cognised all over
As regards the probans that has been but forward (under 1371), in the, form ‘because it is apprehended somehow’,—the object of this is not open to uncertainty; hence it is useless
That the positive entity is essentially existent is known to all persons; then how is it said that it is known ‘somehow’? 
Even under the doctrine that “all things are one”,—on account of the diversity in the nature of the modifications, what is manifested is always in some definitely clear form. Even those who regard all things as ‘featureless’ (devoid of character), always have recourse to such qualifying terms as ‘truly’ and the like
Otherwise, it cannot be admitted that ‘it is somehow apprehended’.—If it is usage that is sought to be proved,—then something well known should form the corroborative instance
As regards ‘being spoken of as the moon this is present also in things where the probandum is known to be present;—or it is also sometimes present in the man (who is spoken of as the moon), or in camphor, silver and such other things (which are also called ‘moon’)
There would be ‘uniqueness’ only if the probans were meant to prove ‘moon-ness’; as, in the absence of any well-known fact regarding it, it would be based entirely upon the nature of the thing itself
There is no distinction perceived between ‘being brought about by the falling insect’ and ‘having its appearance felt on the touch of the falling insect’
Falling’ must be made a qualification in the probans; otherwise ‘inconclusiveness’ (falsity) would be inevitable
1398) If what is meant to be proved (asserted in the conclusion) is that between the two (the pain and the insect) there is the relation of cause and effect,—which has been forgotten,—then the probans would be ‘three-featured’, as there would be a corroborative instance provided by previous experience
As a matter of fact, the very existence of the eye,—which is the subject—is still uncertain; and the proving of this (existence) cannot be right,—as it would be open to the defects of ‘inadmissibility’ and the rest
But sometimes, even though colour and other things are there, visual perception does not take place; hence it is understood that that (perception) alone cannot be a reason (for the existence of the eye)
The sprout is actually found to exist as having its birth inseparably connected with its cause; and this is always available as the corroborative instance; the instance per dissimilarity is too clear (to be stated)
In proving that the jar and other things are “somehow nonexistent”,—the probans is found as, in a previous case, to be ‘futile’ and also ‘inadmissible’
Here also, there is a clear corroborative instance per dissimilarity; that same form of the things becomes the thing where the probandum is known to be absent,—in the proving of the character of ‘being somehow existent’ in regard to non-entities,—there would be ‘proving of what is already admitted’; also ‘inadmissibility’, and the concomitance of the contrary character in that way
When the presence of the father in the house is sought to be proved by the hearing of the father’s voice,—the probans in this case is clearly ‘three-featured’. As, surely, at some time previously the concomitance of the voice has been perceived; if it has never been so perceived, then the ‘inadmissibility’ of the probans would be irresistible
In that house wherein the father had been found before,—and also in that wherein he had not been found before,—there is the concomitance, positive and negative, clearly perceived,—as regards the word, it does not make known any external object at all; because in this case, the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’ is not present; the word can only be the indicator of the ‘speaker’s wish’ (to speak of a certain thing). If this (speaker’s wish) were meant to be what is expressed by the word, then its difference is quite clear. Because when the ‘speaker’s wish’ is not there, the word cannot be used.—As regards the lamp, it does not make the blue and other things known by becoming the indicative (inferential); all that it does is to make things capable of being cognised; and it is only in this sense that it is called a ‘means of cognition only in case the word were an inferential indicative, would it be necessary to consider if it fulfils the conditions of being present in the subject (minor term.) and so forth. Otherwise, why cannot the same be urged in connection with the eye and other organs (as means of cognition)?—Even through the character of ‘being otherwise impossible’, visibility cannot prove anything, unless it is present in the subject (minor term).—Thus ‘one-featured’ probans are all impotent.—In those that have been cited as ‘one-featured’ probans, the presence of two features becomes clearly indicated; and in those that have been cited as ‘two-featured’, the presence of three features becomes clearly indicated; because every probans must reside in the subject (which therefore is an additional condition that must be fulfilled).—If it be argued that “this feature is implied by the character of being otherwise impossible”,—that cannot be so; because in the case of sound, though visibility may be otherwise desired, it is not present in sound (which is the subject)
In the case of such probans as ‘because he is the son of so and so’, the contrary being open to doubt, the three conditions are not present; because what is cited is not incompatible with the contrary
Even when the child is born of a certain person, there is always a likelihood of diversity in its features, by reason of the peculiarities of such causes as the ‘destiny’ (of the child) and food (of the parents) and so forth.—Further, (a) what is cited as the probans does not constitute the nature (of the probandum); (b) nor is that its effect; (c) nor is it of the nature of ‘the non-perception of the perceptible’;—and apart from these (three) there is nothing that can make the probans ‘infallible’ (true)
The said ‘infallibility’ is seen in other cases also: for instance, (1) the blooming of the lily and the rise in the sea have the rise of the moon for their ‘indicative’. (2) From the presence of sun-light, the presence of shade on the other side is inferred
3) When the half-burnt wood-piece is seen in the dark from a distance, it brings up the idea of smoke
4) From the rise of the kṛttikā (asterism) is inferred the proximity of the rohiṇī (asterism).” 
If there is no statement of the proposition, there can be no statement of the reason (probans); and consequently, there need be no statement of the reaffirmation, for the purpose of intimating the existence (of the probans in the minor term, subject).—Mere presence (of the probans in the subject) having been stated at first, and then, if its invariable concomitance (with the probandum) is subsequently pointed out,—by this all that is intended becomes accomplished; so that the representment would be entirely useless
As a matter of fact, the proving is accomplished by the force of the statement of the three-featured probans; consequently, there can be no suspicion regarding the contrary conclusion; hence the statement of the final conclusion is useless
As a matter of fact, it is only by connected assertions that an idea is expressed; hence for the purpose of bringing about this connection, it is not necessary to state the final conclusion separately
Some people hold that inference is of two kinds as followsa) that based upon perceived particulars and (b) that based upon generalised relationship
a) “That based upon the relationship of perceived particulars is as follows:—it so happens that, in the case of two particular things,—such as the fire produced by burning dried cow-dung, and the smoke proceeding from that fire,—the observer has the cognition of the things,—and then subsequently, on going to another place, the observer happens again and again to recognise in other places the presence of the same fire through the indication of the same smoke seen before; and due validity attaches to such cognition (by reason of its being based upon the previous perceptional cognition), and it becomes recognised as a means of cognition distinct from perception; because it brings about the cognition of a thing (fire) the existence of which had been in doubt. It is this that has been described by Vindhyavāsin as inference based upon the perceived relationship of particulars”.—[Ślokavārtika—inference, 141-143]
1443-1445) “Though the inference based upon generalised relationship could be exemplified on the basis of another fire and another smoke,—yet the inference cited is that of the ‘sun moving’, as this is based absolutely upon generalised relationship”—[Ślokavārtika.—inference, 145]
Inasmuch as it has been proved that ‘perpetual flux’ is all-embracing, there can be no inference of what has gone before,—by itself.—If it be argued that “the sameness is assumed on the basis of the sameness of the chain”—Then (the answer is that) no such sameness can have any real existence; and what is merely assumed cannot be an entity
A cognition devoid of objects is not admitted by you; and if the inference had an assumed object, it would clearly be devoid of an object
If what is meant is that—“even on the destruction of the individual, the universal persists”,—then, that cannot be; because even if the universal existed, that also would certainly be covered by the ‘perpetual flux’.—Further, on what grounds have you asserted the restriction that “these same two particulars whose relationship has been cognised by sense-perception, etc. etc.” (text 1443)?—Then again, having once cognised a thing by means of inference, if the same thing is cognised again by means of inference,—why is not this latter regarded as valid? What is the peculiarity in the previous one (whereby it is regarded as valid, and not the later one)?—If it be urged that—“the later one is not regarded as valid because like remembrance, it apprehends what has been already apprehended”,—then why is not the previous inference also regarded as the same?—If it be argued that—“in the former inference there is this additional peculiarity that it sets aside the doubt that has set in during the interval,”—why is not the same in the latter also? Hence it is this latter itself that sets aside the doubt as to something being present or not present; and hence the generalised perception is really what is independent
Some short-sighted people have asserted that “inference is not a means of right cognition”, though, by these very words, they offer up their own ‘desire to speak’ (intention, idea in the mind, as something to be inferred from those words)
Inference for one’s own sake cannot be right,—because it is brought about by the three-featured indicative, which is subversive of what is desirable,—like wrong cognition.—nor can the presence of the ‘three features’ in the indicative be regarded as the means of inference; as they are present also where there is no inference,—just like the ‘two features’.—Further, the contradiction of inference is possible in every reasoning; so also there is possibility in every case of the inferring of mutually contradictory conclusions; and there is possibility of finding a reason which is concomitant (not-separable) with the contrary of the desired conclusion (deduced from an inference).” 
Condition, place and time being different in regard to different potencies, the cognition of things by means of inference is not attainable.—Even in the case of a thing whose potency is well-known, that potency becomes restricted in regard to particular effective actions, by becoming related to particular things.—Even when a certain conclusion has been deduced with great care, from an inference,—it may be proved to be otherwise by other more intelligent and clever persons well-versed in the art of reasoning”vākyapadīya, p. 16]
Inference for the benefit of another cannot be a means of right cognition, because it is only a reiteration so far as the speaker himself is concerned; as the man putting forward the inference does not himself derive his knowledge of the thing from that inference.—For the other person, to whom the inference is addressed, the cognition so derived comes to be for his own sake; because what difference is there between the cognition derived through the ear and that obtained through the eyes?—so far as the other person is concerned, the statement (of the inference) cannot be regarded as inference for the sake of another; because it falls within the chain of cognitions produced by the ear, and because it is a means of cognition,—like the sense-organ,—nor is there any direct indication of the object inferred hence, like the idea of the relation of invariable concomitance, it cannot be a means of right cognition.—If it be explained that—“it is called for the sake of another, because it leads to the activity of the other person”,—that also cannot be right; because (in this way), the inference for one’s own benefit also might be regarded as ‘for the sake of another’ [as that also might lead to the activity of other persons].” 
When the inference is spoken of as ‘brought about by the three-featured indicative’, what is meant to be indicated is that it is compatible (with the real state of things); and this same (compatibility) is what characterises the valid cognition; why then is it denied? 
When the ‘wrong cognition’, as ‘subversive of what is desirable’, is spoken of as being ‘similar’, the ‘similarity’ meant must be only that of the view of the first party,—and not real similarity; because as regards the real state of things, the cognition in question has been definitely found to be not incompatible; in fact, it is in view of this fact that it is a valid argument against what is ‘desired’ by the disputant.—Thus the reason adduced is found to be ‘contradictory’;—and the corroborative instance also is found to be devoid of the probandum.—In the same way, in the second argument, the probans is ‘inadmissible’
Exponents of the true reasoning have all declared that that reason alone is capable of proving the conclusion whose relationship (with the probandum) is known with certainty,—such relationship being either in the nature of sameness of essence or of being an effect;—and against such a probans, there can be no such defect as that of ‘being contrary to inference’ and so forth. Because no such inference could be possible except through essential sameness or being the cause. Mutually contradictory properties cannot belong to the same thing. Consequently there can be no possibility of any pbobans which might be concomitant with the contrary of the desired conclusion
As a matter of fact, inference proceeds only on the basis of things whose ‘indicative character’ has been properly ascertained by repeated experience; all else is regarded as ‘not inference so that even though the potencies of things vary according to the variations of condition, time and place, yet the cognition of things by means of inference is not unattainable.—And when a certain conclusion has been deduced, with great care from an inference,—it cannot be proved to be otherwise, even by cleverer persons
a) there can be no nature (or character) without a nature (or character); (b) nor can there be effect without a cause. Because (otherwise) there would be the incongruities of (a) ‘deviation from nature’, and (b) ‘causelessness and without these two (relationships) there can be no inference
The statement of the three-featured probans has been described as ‘inference for the benefit of another’, on the ground of its being indicative of what is possible,—with reference to the other person addressed. but this ‘inferential character’ can only be ‘secondary’ (figurative) and conventional. hence the fact of its being ‘indicative of what is possible’ cannot lead to any incongruity.—if inference is not a means of right cognition, then your assertion is useless. Indeed no disputant ever comprehends what you wish to speak of
If it be urged that—“what is ordinarily known as the inferential indicative is accepted by us, but not what has been set up by others”,—then (the answer is that) even the ordinary man understands what is the ‘cause etc. of the effect, etc.’; and in reality, this is all that the masters of the science of reasoning also have declared. So that when the ordinary (popular) idea is accepted, what is it that becomes excluded? 
If this (inference) is not a means of knowledge, then what does the other party understand by it?—Of what sort too would that cognition be which has been brought about by what is not a means of cognition? 
Inference, consisting of a verbal statement, is not a means of knowledge for the speaker; he only conveys the idea to the other party by means of the statement.” A certain means of knowledge is held to be not a means of knowledge only when it does not bring about the cognition of what is not already known; as for instance, the inference that you have put forward, which conveys no idea to the speaker

Inasmuch as there are other means or forms of knowledge, in the shape of verbal cognition and others,—why has the definition of only two such means been provided?” 
Inasmuch as there are other means or forms of knowledge, in the shape of verbal cognition and others,—why has the definition of only two such means been provided?” 
The reply to this is as follows:—in fact, there cannot be any form of cognition except the two (already described); because all the others that have been postulated either do not possess the character of the ‘form of right cognition’, or are included in these two
Other people have declared ‘verbal cognition’ to be “that knowledge of imperceptible things which is derived from words”;—and [they provide the following account of it],—“that cognition is derived from (a) the eternal sentence and from (b) the sentence uttered by a trustworthy person.—This cannot be ‘sense-perception’, because the object apprehended by it is beyond the reach of the senses;—nor can it be ‘inference because it is devoid of the characteristic features of inference;—until the subject (minor term) is definitely known to be possessed of the probandum and also of the probans, it cannot be regarded as a case of ‘inference’ of that subject
In the case in question (i.e. in verbal cognition) that which would be regarded as the subject forms the object cognised itself; and unless this is cognised, there can be no idea of any character (probans) belonging to it.” 
And if the subject has already been cognised, prior to the recognition of the probans in the subject (i.e. the minor premiss)—then what is the use of knowing that the probans subsists in it and so forth, by virtue of which the cognition could be regarded as inference?” 
Nor cast the concomitance of the word with the object inferred (probandum) be ascertained; the concomitance of all things is recognised only by their functioning.” 
It is only when the eire exists whenever there is smoke that its concomitance is clearly perceived. in the case in question however, there is no such certain idea as that ‘the thing spoken of exists wherever the word exists’.” 
It does not exist at the place (where the word is); nor at the time.—If it he urged that the required concomitance would be there in view of the eternality and the all-pervasive character (of the word)”,—then [the answer is that] that would be so with all words; and for that same reason the concomitance being perceived in all cases, there would be no idea of the negative concomitance at all; and it would thus be possible for all words to provide the cognition of all things.” 
Thus the verbal cognition is not-inference—because it is devoid of the three features;—like sense-perception;—as is shown by the absence of an object like that.” 
Inasmuch as the words speaking of the agnihotra and other things bring about unshakeable cognitions,—the character of being eight cognition cannot be denied to them.” 
As regards the ‘eternal sentence’, its possibility and expressiveness (usefulness) are both improbable; hence the first definition of ‘verbal cognition’ is an ‘impossible’ one
The sentence may be ‘capable’ or ‘incapable’; in either case, as the character would be always there, the cognition resulting therefrom would come about (always); or it would not come about at all
Just as hatred, delusion, etc. are known to be sources of error, so are compassion, wisdom, etc. known to be sources of truthfulness. where, then, there is no person as the source, these two also cannot be there. consequently the sentence that does not emanate from a person must be inexpressive (useless)
If it be urged that—“a certain meaning is actually comprehended from words, hence they cannot be inexpressive or useless”,—then (the answer is that) such comprehension can only be derived from explanations provided; and in the matter of explanations, it is found that the expounder is free to explain things as he likes.—It might be argued that—“the word, by its very nature, has the potency to denote well-established things”.—In that case, its meaning would be comprehended also by one who has no knowledge of the convention (bearing upon the word and its denotation). Further, the lamp, which is illuminative by its very nature, does not need a convention (in illumining things). Lastly, as there is another convention also (bearing upon the same word), there could be no comprehension of that other thing from that same word. Even though there be a convention, the lamp cannot manifest odour, taste, etc.—Nor can any such potency (of words) be recognised
Thus, inasmuch as there can be no cognition of the meaning (of the Veda),—how can there be any ‘unshake ability’ in that cognition? it could be possible only on the basis of conventions; and in this, it would not be different from the words of human beings. in fact, persons well-versed in the science of reasoning do not recognise any difference between these two.—It can be ‘unshakeable’ only for the śrotriyas who are ignorant of the ways of reasoning
Because the ‘trustworthy person’ is not admitted, therefore the second definition also of verbal cognition is not proper.—Even if such a person were regarded as possible, that a certain person is such a one cannot be ascertained
If it be urged that—“that person is regarded as trustworthy in regard to imperceptible things, whose assertions are found to be true in most cases”,—then (the answer is that) the mere fact of one’s assertion being not true in some individual case, cannot prove that his assertions are never true; nor can the fact of its being true in one case prove that all his assertions are true
What is the connection between words and external objects, by expressing which latter the words would be ‘true’ (valid)?—The connection between them cannot be of the nature of being the same in essence,—because they are apprehended by different sense-organs, and for other reasons. nor can the connection between them be that of one being produced from the other; because this is not true. Nor is there any other connection possible which could be true
From all verbal statements there follows inference of the ‘desire to speak’ (i.e. intention, on the part of the speaker); this (intention) is definitely known to be the cause (source) of the words, through direct perception and non-apprehension
In the case of the man under an illusion, a verbal statement is found which is quite different from what the man ‘desired to say’; so also in the case of the ‘desire to speak’ in general; hence the verbal statement cannot function (towards bringing about the cognition of any desire to speak)”;—if this is urged,then the answer is that) there is clear distinction between words used by the man under an illusion and those used by one who is not under an illusion. Clever men are quite able to discern this difference through the context and such other circumstances
Difference among words is due to difference among their causes.—If there are people who do not notice this difference, the fault is theirs, not of the indicative.—Otherwise, the fact of mere suspected smoke not having for once brought about the true notion of fire,—might lead to the conclusion that even when cognised with certainty, smoke cannot be a true indicative of fire
In the case of those words also, there is no incongruity in the inference of the simple ‘desire to speak’; because it is always there;—for the purpose of establishing the fact of its being produced by the speaker’s breath and so forth
When the ‘desire to speak’ is the thing to be inferred, the presence of the three features is quite clear;—the man is the minor term, wherein the presence of the desire is the probandum, which is proved by its effect in the shape of the verbal statement (probans). For example (the form of the inference would be)—this man is cognised as having had the desire to speak of the tree,—because he has uttered the word ‘tree’,—just as i had done under previous circumstances
Thus then, in cases where the other party have denied the presence of the three features,—we do not regard the verbal statement to be a means of cognition.—In cases, however, where the presence of the three features is admitted by them, the fact of its being ‘three-featured’ is quite clear.—Where the ‘desire to speak’ is to be proved, it has been shown that the three features are present.—Such being the case, the word is as good a means of inference as the smoke,—because it is equipped with the three features, and because its objective is of that same kind
Thus then, in cases where the other party have denied the presence of the three features,—we do not regard the verbal statement to be a means of cognition.—In cases, however, where the presence of the three features is admitted by them, the fact of its being ‘three-featured’ is quite clear.—Where the ‘desire to speak’ is to be proved, it has been shown that the three features are present.—Such being the case, the word is as good a means of inference as the smoke,—because it is equipped with the three features, and because its objective is of that same kind
What sort of an animal is the gavaya?’—on being thus questioned by people living in the city, the forester makes the statement ‘as the cow so is the gavaya’; it is this that is known as upamāna (analogy).—according to Śabara’s view however, this is not outside the scope of ‘word’ (verbal statement), hence it has been described in another way.—[Ślokavārtika-Upamāna, 1-2.] 
What sort of an animal is the gavaya?’—on being thus questioned by people living in the city, the forester makes the statement ‘as the cow so is the gavaya’; it is this that is known as upamāna (analogy).—according to Śabara’s view however, this is not outside the scope of ‘word’ (verbal statement), hence it has been described in another way.—[Ślokavārtika-Upamāna, 1-2.] 
Having seen the cow, when the man goes to the forest and sees the gavaya, bearing a manifold commonalty (similitude, to the cow) in several parts of the body, but with rounded neck (not with the dewlap);—the first cognition that he has of the gavaya is one that apprehends only its shape; and this cognition is purely perceptional. the cognition that follows is in the more determinate form—“the shape of this animal is similar to the cow’s”; and this also comes about only when the operation of the senses is there; so that this also is regarded to be perceptional.” 
Though the said cognition appears on the remembrance of the cow,—yet, on account of subsisting in the gavaya, there is proximity (of the similarity, to the senses), and hence it would be within reach of the senses.” 
Like the universal, similarity resides in its entirety in each member; because even when the co-relative is not perceived, the similarity is actually perceived.” 
The fact of similarity being an entity cannot be denied; because it actually exists in the form of the presence in a thing of one kind of several parts similar to those in that of another kind.”—[Ślokavārtika-upamāna, 18.] 
Under the said circumstances, the cognition that appears in the form, ‘the cow is similar to this animal’, is what is called analogical cognition.” 
Thus that which is remembered, and which is qualified by the (perceived) similarity, is the object that is apprehended by analogical cognition. or, the object of the said cognition may consist of the similarity itself as subsisting in that (remembered) thing.”—[Ślokavārtika-upamāna, 37.] 
Similarity having been apprehended by sense-perception,—and the cow haying been remembered,—the two together (i.e. the cow qualified by similarity) are not cognisable by any other means of cognition; hence herein lies the functioning of analogy as a means of cognition.” 
For instance, in the case of the well-known inference of fire from smoke] though the place is perceived by sense-perception, and the fire (in the kitchen) is remembered,—yet the cognition of the two together (i.e. the fire and the place in the hill), does not cease to be inferential 
a) Analogical cognition cannot be regarded as sense-perception,—because it is entirely devoid of the functioning of the senses. (b) Nor can it be regarded as inference, because the ‘three-features’ are not there; for instance, there is no probans here (which subsists in the subject); and the similarity of the cow (to the gavaya) has not been previously cognised as subsisting in the subject; and the similarity that is perceived in the gavaya cannot bring about the inference of the cow.” 
The similarity residing in the cow cannot serve as the probans, as it forms a part of the proposition itself. the gavaya also cannot serve as the probans indicative of the cow, as it has no connection with the cow.” 
The cognition in question cannot be regarded as not a form of right cognition; because it makes known what is not already known; for instance, before the perception of the gavaya, its similarity (in the cow) has not been apprehended at all.” 
As there is no object that could be cognised by this means, it cannot be regarded as a means of cognition.—It might be urged that—“there is the connection of the manifold commonalty of component parts, which is what is cognised”.—But commonalty itself haying been rejected, how could there be any manifoldness in regard to it? How too could there be any ‘connection’ with such manifold ‘commonalty’? [says the opponent]—“There is a means of cognition which brings about the cognition of such commonalty, in the form of the inference that—commonalty is an entity and is apprehended by sense-perception, because it is cognisable as something other than negation,—like the unique entity”.—[the answer to this follows in the following text 1545.] 
The reason (premise) here put forward is ‘not admissible’ for those who declare that anything cognisable in the form of ‘commonalty’ (or universal) falls tinder the category of the ‘non-existent and in the case of the former of the two probanda (put forth), the premiss becomes part of the proposition itself
What happens in this case is that there are some parts in the gavaya’s body which bring about cognitions similar to those brought about by the parts of the cow’s body;—hence when the gavaya is seen, there follows the remembrance of the parts of the cow’s body that have been seen before repeatedly. It is for this reason that, there does not arise any idea of the horse and other animals, through that similarity,—but it does arise when the gavaya is seen. otherwise, if there were no such remembrance, what would be the difference (between the case of the cow and that of the horse)? 
Remembrance cannot be a form of valid cognition, because it envisages what is already known. How then could it be regarded as a distinct form of valid cognition? 
Or, similarity may be an entity, residing in the cow, like the commonalty (or universal); even so, it will have been perceived in the cow standing before the person before he sees the co-relative (gavaya); and as such the cognition of the said similarity following upon the seeing of the gavaya cannot escape from being of the nature of remembrance.—[says the other party]—“What has been previously seen in the cow is similarity merely existing there, and it has not been definitely ascertained that it is similarity to the gavaya; while this latter is what is apprehended by analogical cognition, which, thus, is different from remembrance.” 
Even if the similarity had not been previously apprehended under that name, it was apprehended all the same, in its own form, which is called its very self
Mere name does not constitute the ‘essence’ of things; by virtue of which, when it (the name) has not been apprehended, the things could be regarded as ‘not known’, by people who know the true nature of the self
If on the strength of the slight element of valid cognition (found in analogical cognition),—it were to be regarded as an independent form of cognition,—then there could be no limit to the number of such independent forms of cognition; specially as there are other ways in which such slight elements of cognition could be found
When a line of trees and such things are seen, what is actually perceived is only one tree, and yet some idea of the second tree being there, there follows the definite cognition (in regard to the former tree) that ‘this is the first’;—and this will have to be regarded as a distinct form of cognition; as it does not depend upon any element of ‘similarity’ or other conditions (attendant upon the well-known forms of cognition).—If it is denied in this case, on the ground that it apprehends only what has been already apprehended,—then the same might be said in regard to analogical cognitions also
When one sees the gavaya, there appears the notion of its ‘dissimilarity’ to the horse and other animals; why cannot this be a distinct form of cognition?—If it be urged that “it cannot be so regarded because it is included under negation”,—then, the same might be said in regard to the notions of ‘similarity’ which also are included under ‘mutual negation’
Just as distinction from ‘similarity’ is cognised in that case, so also is distinction from ‘all common parts’ cognised in the other case also
It has been proved that the relation has no existence apart from the relatives;—on the previous occasion, at the time of the convention, the name was perceived by auditory perception;—and later on the animal standing before the man is seen with the eye;—apart from these two already thus cognised, any mingling up of the two could not be valid cognition. Because any other cognition could only recapitulate what has been already cognised; as in the case of the notions of ‘fragrant’ and ‘sweet—thus the notion of the connection of the name cannot escape prom being op' the nature of remembrance
Notions of connection with names are produced by endless means, even apart from similarity; as is found in the case of such names as ‘nampa’ (king) and the like
That person is the king who is protected from the rays of the sun by the white umbrella’,—having been told thus, the man, later on, sees such a person,—and through the said advice, comes to have the notion that ‘this is the person bearing the name king’.—Now this would have to be regarded as a distinct form of valid cognition, as it has not been brought about by similarity or any such conditions (as bring about other forms of cognition)
Another party seeks to prove the existence of another form of cognition, on the strength of inference, thus perception is connected with a form of cognition different from inference, because it is a form of cognition, like inference. Similarly inference also.”—This is not right; as the probans cited is not invariably concomitant (with the probandum); and specially because nothing is put forward which would negative the contrary of the desired conclusion.—Further, in this way, you would be running counter to the doctrine of ‘four forms of cognition’. The answer that you would have to that would also serve here

If a certain fact, cognised through the six means of cognition. is found to be otherwise inexplicable, and thence leads to the assumption of some other fact,—this is called ‘arthāpatti’ ‘presumption’”.—[Kumārila: Ślokavārtika-arthāpatti, 1.] 
If a certain fact, cognised through the six means of cognition. is found to be otherwise inexplicable, and thence leads to the assumption of some other fact,—this is called ‘arthāpatti’ ‘presumption’”.—[Kumārila: Ślokavārtika-arthāpatti, 1.] 
For example the assumption of the burning power of fire, based upon the perceived pact of its haying burnt a certain thing; the assumption of the mobility of the sun based upon the inferred fact of its going from place to place.—[Ślokavārtika—presumption, 3]; the potencies of all things are presumed on the basis of the inexplicability of the effects produced by them; [Ślokavārtika—śūnya, 254]; and all such potencies that become cognised are such as have not been known already,—and these are cognised without any idea of the relation (of concomitance).” 
The relation of these potencies has not been previously cognised;—nor is it cognised now; and it is only on the basis of such cognitions that there could be the two premisses.” 
In the case of proving the potency of the ear, etc., whatever probans might be put forward, would all be found to be ‘of unknown substratum’; as the substratum would consist of the potencies themselves, and these are still unknown.” 
He is corpulent and does not eat during the day’—On hearing such words, one concludes that the man eats at night; and this is presumption based upon what is heard.”—[Ślokavārtika-arthāpatti.— presumption, 51] 
As a matter of fact, the idea of the night (and the man eating at night) cannot be derived from the sentence speaking of the day (and the man not eating); because what is expressed by the words of the latter has no connection with eating at night. Nor is there any contradistinction whereby the latter could indicate the eating at night.—Nor can a second (and totally different) meaning be attributed to the words (speaking of the day); because these are already taken up in expressing another idea.—From all this it follows that the idea in question (of eating at night) is derived from a totally different sentence present only in the mind of the person.—Thus then, this sentence (in the mind), though it is not actually verbally expressed, is yet duly cognised,—and it has to be pointed out which one among the means of cognition, perception and the rest, it is which brings about the cognition of the said (unspoken) sentence.—As the sentence is not actually spoken, it could not be perception; nor could it be inference, because the sentence has never been found to be concomitant with the other factor; and if, even when this relation (of concomitance) has never been perceived, the factor concerned were regarded as an inferential indicative,—then the utterance of any one sentence might bring about the cognition of all sentences; because on the point of being unrelated, there would be no distinction between one sentence and another.”—[Ślokavārtika-arthāpatti, 56-61.] 
The cow is likened to the gavaya,—a cognition is produced by this likeness,—the potency in the object whereby it becomes apprehended by that cognition,—is debited on the strength of the said analogical cognition.” 
Inasmuch as the denotation of a word cannot be otherwise defined, we assume the expressive potency of words; and as this potency would not be otherwise possible, we deduce, through another presumption, the eternality of words;—[ślokavārtika-arthāpatti, 6-7];—because what is non-eternal cannot be related to any contention.” 
The absence of caitra from the house having been cognised through negation, the cognition of the presence of caitra outside the house which is marked by his absence, has been cited; this is to be regarded as another kind of presumption, based upon negation.—[Ślokavārtika-arthāpatti, 8-9].—This (presumption) is different from inference, because the minor premiss (probans as residing in the minor term) and the other factors do not form part of it. When the object cognised, is either the man connected with the exterior (of the house), or the exterior connected with the man,—in either case, how could ‘absence in the house’ serve as the probans (residing in that subject)?—[ibid., 10-12].—What is regarded as the probans in this case is the ‘absence of the living man in the house’; and there can be no cognition of this absence without knowing his presence outside the house. [ibid., 19].—As for pure ‘absence in the house’,—apart from the idea of his being alive—such absence is found in the case of dead persons also, and hence cannot be a proof of his presence outside”.—[ibid., 21]
Apart from the potent object, there is no such thing as ‘potency’, which could be cognised by means of presumption; and as for the potent object, it is cognised through perception itself
In the case of such phenomena as burning and the rest, their cause is actually perceived in the form of the fire and the rest, and there is nothing wrong or uncertain in this perception; what then could ‘potency’ be, apart from those causes?—If the ‘potency’ is something different (from the said causes), then as that ‘potency’ would be what brings about the effect, the object (cause) itself would not be an active agent at all (in the bringing about of that effect); if, on the other hand, the object does bring about the effect, then the potency would not be anything different; because the characteristic feature of the ‘object’ is that it should be capable of effective action; and that the object is so capable is learnt from perception itself
There is no means of knowing any other characteristic of potency. even if such another characteristic were known, there would be no use for it; as the effect would be accomplished by the mere presence of the object
What was asserted on the previous occasion was only the fact of the apprehension of sound being dependent on other causes,—on the ground that even when its cause was there, it did not come about, because something else was absent;—as in the case of the sprout and such things
When the sun reaches another place, what happens always is that it is born (again) in a place different from its original place; this is as it is found in the case of the fire-flame; a thing that remains permanent is of a totally different kind; otherwise such reaching of another place would not be possible.—As regards potency, it has already been shown that it is nothing apart from the thing
No certain cognition can result from the assertion that ‘the fat man eats not during the day’,—as the speaker might be asserting this through enmity or delusion and such other causes
If another expressive statement is indicated (in presumption) by the first statement, independently of what is expressed by itself,—then that other statement also would indicate another statement
If, the idea of what is expressed by the sentence is admitted as emanating from the other person, or as brought about by another means of cognition,—then the cognition of what is expressed by the later sentence may be regarded as following from that
What is cognised is the man spoken of as related to eating at night;—on the ground of his being fat while going without food during the day,—like another person
That there is fatness when there is eating is known with certainty through positive and negative concomitance; and hence the cognition of one thing follows from the other which is thus related to it
How can a sentence be cognised, which is devoid of all relationship? otherwise all things would be cognised through a single thing
When there is no relationship—or when, even though existent, the relationship is not definitely known,—if the other sentence were indicated, it would be unreliable (invalid), 
There is no such royal edict as that ‘that alone is valid which is related’. how does validity attach to perception, in which there is no relationship?” 
If something unrelated could be cognised,—then why should not there be cognition of other things also? Because in the matter of being unrelated, no distinction among things can be perceived. In the case of perception also, validity rests upon relationship only. The validity of a cognition consists in its being in conformity (with the real state of things), and this conformity depends upon the perception owing its existence to the thing perceived, 
No such ‘conformity’ with the real state of things concerned can be certain, in a cognition of which the particular object is not the basis, or in one which has no (objective) basis at all. Or else, there would be conformity with all (things)
Any other kind is not possible,—in the shape of both perceptible—and imperceptible, or neither perceptible—nor—imperceptible. Because in any single thing, both action and inaction would be selfcontradictory. That thing is called ‘perceptible’ which produces its cognition directly (immediately); the contrary of this is regarded by the wise, as ‘imperceptible’.—Now verbal cognition, analogical cognition and the rest cannot envisage the former (perceptible) thing; as in that case they would become included under ‘perception’, or be futile, like remembrance.—Even if they envisage imperceptible things, in what way could anything be envisaged by all? If directly (immediately), then the thing would not be ‘imperceptible’, being exactly like the perceptible thing. If the cognitions are dependent upon something else (i.e. indirect, mediate), would the cognition be related to it or not related? Would it envisage distinction or not?—If it arose out of what is not related, then there could be no restriction; and if it envisages distinction, then there could be no invariable concomitance. If, lastly, the cognition envisages an imperceptible thing,—is based upon a related object—and does not envisage distinction from it,—then it is clearly ‘inference’

As a matter of fact, every entity has more than one aspect,—like the gem sapphire; why then should there be any incompatibility among ‘existence’, ‘non-existence’ and the rest?” 
As a matter of fact, every entity has more than one aspect,—like the gem sapphire; why then should there be any incompatibility among ‘existence’, ‘non-existence’ and the rest?” 
If an entity were not-equal to (entirely different from) other entities, then it would not differ from the ‘sky-flower’. On the other hand, if it were entirely devoid of non-equality (difference), then it could not be regarded as anything different from those things 
If the intended entity is entirely not-equal to other things, then it ceases to be an entity; for that which is excluded from ‘entity’, where could there be any other position, except non-existence,—as in the case of the ‘sky-flower’? Thus then, one who wishes the entity to be not-equal to the ‘sky-flower’ must accept the universal ‘entity’ as the character common to all entities “If it were not as asserted, then, to what would this fact be due—that the common notion of ‘entity’ does not appear in connection with the ‘crow’s teeth’, while it always appears as restricted to entities alone?—If it be urged that—the said restriction is due to similarity’,—then our answer is that, that same (similarity) is what we call ‘commonalty’.—This same remark applies also to the view that ‘the said restriction is due to a certain capacity in the nature of things’.—Absolute difference (from other entities) therefore is not possible for any entity; because entities do not differ from each other, on the point of being ‘entities’.” 
If the said entity were entirely devoid of dissimilarity from the other standard entities,—then that entity would not be different from these; there would be complete non-difference,—as from their own selves. what is called ‘dissimilarity’ is only a form different from those; hence the idea that ‘there is no dissimilarity, and yet the thing is different’ would involve a self-contradiction. Consequently, when one has to accept some sort of difference among things, he has to accept ‘dissimilarity’ also, and thence also the ‘particular’ character of things.” 
The entity itself is only one in essence, but is regarded as having several aspects; and these aspects are there in the form of being apprehended by inclusive and exclusive cognitions; the former ones, being inclusive, are spoken of as ‘common’ (universal, general), while the latter, being exclusive, are called ‘particular’
If the ‘general’ and the ‘particular’ were of the nature of each other, commingling and confusion would be inevitable; hence it cannot be possible that every entity has two aspects.—If they are not of the nature of each other, then they are diverse (two distinct things), and hence it does not follow that there are ‘two aspects’ (of a single entity)
Though the entity may be of one nature only, yet it can have different properties; there could be no incongruity in the presence of different states (of the same thing); which is found, for example, in the case of the potencies of the active agencies;—nor can there be any incongruity in what is actually seen; and it is actually seen that even though the general and the particular are aspects of one and the same thing, yet in actual practical life there is difference between them.” 
In fact, if the thing has only one form, it cannot have diverse properties; a diversity that is not a creation of fancy is what is called ‘plurality’
As regards the potencies, their diversity is merely a creation of the speaker’s ‘desire to speak’; here also no diversity can be reasonable in what is essentially one
Things are said to be ‘one’ when it is said ‘this is that’; whereas they are said to be ‘diverse’ when it is said ‘this is not that being that and not being that thus being mutually contradictory, cannot, in any way, be attributed to any one entity
Affirmation and denial are mutually contradictory; and they cannot be made by any sane-minded person, in regard to one and the same thing
When an entity, excluded from several like and unlike things, is differentiated from this and that,—that is called ‘the diversity of properties’. In this way even a single thing may be assumed to have numberless diverse forms; but in reality, no single thing can reasonably have two forms
Such entities as Narasiṃha and others which have been described as having dual characters,—in their case also the dual character is not real. As a matter of fact, Narasiṃha is of the nature of an aggregate of many atoms, and is not endowed with any one uniform form; what is variegated (various) cannot be one,—as is found in the case of the collection of several kinds of gems.—If there were one form, there could not be a dual character and the consequent appearance of several shapes; and even if the smallest part of the body that could be covered by the leg of a fly were hidden, the body could not be said to be not-hidden
By their very nature, the said atoms are the basis of the recognition that envisages the salient features of the man and the lion;—as is clear from the fact of its arising from a particular idea. In this same way are the variegated gems and other cases disposed of.—The variegated character, based upon the presence of several forms, is certainly incompatible with unity
Being an entity’ is said to consist in ‘capacity for effective, action’; if this were all-pervasive, then every thing would be capable of doing every thing. Generally, one thing is held to be productive of another, only by reason of the, presence, in it, of the capacity for that action; if then, that capacity is equally present in another thing, why should not this be productive of the same?—If the ‘blue’ and other objects themselves are held to constitute the all-embracing character of ‘entity’, then the white and yellow things also would do what is done by the blue one; and in that case, the whole universe would become a single ‘entity devoid of a second; and thus it would not be true that a single thing has several aspects.—If the blue, etc. themselves do not constitute ‘entity’,—and this is like the ‘being’ (sattva) posited by ‘Kaṇāda’,—then it cannot be as you hold, that one thing cannot have several aspects; as there would be clear difference—Further, what constitutes ‘difference’ among things is the presence of contrary properties, and no other kind of ‘difference’ is held to lie between ‘blue’ and ‘yellow this same condition is present between the ‘general’ and the ‘particular’; because while the former is ‘inclusive’, the latter is otherwise. Why then should not ‘difference’ be admitted as clearly lying between them? 
As in the case of the variegated colour, one may emphasise any one colour as he chooses,—because the colour is variegated,—in the same way ‘difference’ or ‘non-difference’ of an entity might be emphasised
Ślokavārtika-ākṛti, 57-58).—When a thing of a mixed character is cognised simultaneously, then all distinctions like ‘difference’, ‘sameness’ and so forth, disappearibid., 62-63).” 
When a thing has several forms, one may emphasise any one according to his own whim, either successively or simultaneously; there can be no other way with verbal expressions
It cannot be as explained above. that what is ‘variegated’ cannot be ‘one’ has just been pointed out. ‘variegation’ consists in ‘several forms’, and it can never be concomitant with ‘unity’.—All the real forms that there may be of a certain thing would be so many (different) things; and the thing in question itself remains only one
If a certain thing were excluded from one ‘entity’, it would be devoid of sameness only with that entity; it would not become like the ‘sky-flower’;—as it would still be capable of efficient action
As a matter of fact, the capable (potent) form of one entity does not reside in other entities,—because the effect produced and the form of the apprehension are found to be different and so forth; this has been explained before.—‘that a certain entity is not the same as the other’,—this alone can follow from the exclusion (of differentiation) therefrom;—and not the fact of its being a non-entity devoid of all properties
The conception being there that ‘that also is capable of effective action’,—there would be this idea that ‘it is an entity’ thus there would be subjective similarity consisting in ‘differentiation from what is incapable’. Thus, even though there is absolute difference, there is a subjective similarity; and thus an ‘entity’ being ‘equal’ to other entities, becomes distinguished from the ‘sky-flower’
If the form in which a certain thing is differentiated from other things,—homogeneous and heterogeneous—were the same in which it is similar to the homogeneous things, then it should be recognised as similar to the heterogeneous things also; as the form would be the same in both cases.—And yet it is not so recognised.—Hence it follows that the form in which the thing is not similar to the homogeneous things, and the form in which it is similar to these,—must be different from one another.” 
It is in that same form that it is understood to be similar, because the cause of such understanding is present, in the shape of being the cause of one and the same conception, as differentiating these from other things
It is only certain things that can serve as the basis of one and the same conception,—the restriction being due to the capacity of the form of things, even when there is difference,—as is found in the case of the sense-organs and the amṛtā and the like
How can the eye be productive of the cognition of the blue and other things,—if it is held to have that form alone which is differentiated from the blue and others? in fact, just as the ear is not regarded as productive of the cognition of blue, etc., on account of its being different from the blue, etc. which are productive of the cognition of blue, etc.,—so also the eye should not be regarded as the cause of that cognition.—How could any other thing, which is different from the productive cause, be productive of it?—from all this follows the conclusion that there must be inclusiveness also among things.” 
If it were not as above, then, ‘differentiation’ being the same in both cases, why is not the ear also regarded as productive of the cognition of blue, etc.,—just like the eye, which also is different from the colours?” 
The ‘exclusion’ (differentiation) of the eye, etc. from the cause (of the cognition of blue) is not admitted, without qualification. Because the nature of the eye, etc. is also regarded as the cause; and it is not possible for anything to be ‘excluded’ from its own nature; if there were ‘exclusion’ of a thing from its own nature, the thing would become devoid of all character. When ‘exclusion’ is spoken of, it is exclusion from another cause that is meant; what is meant being that the eye is not of the form of that other cause and this is quite acceptable to us,—it is not that what is productive of the cognition is described precisely as it exists. In fact, all cognitions proceed from their own specific causes. If, on the ground of their being of the same nature, they were regarded as a single productive cause,—then, as the said nature itself is there (as the cause’, what would be the use of other auxiliaries if it be held that—‘on account of defects in other particulars, the one (nature) is not productive (of the cognition)’,—then (the answer is that) those causes are incapable (of bringing about the cognition in question), by reason of difference. If there were no difference, how could they be defective?—Just as, even when there is difference—as among particular things,—everything is not the cause of every other thing,—in the same way, even though there would be no difference in ‘plurality’, yet there would be restriction (of only some causes bringing about some effects). Even when there is difference, it is only a certain thing that would be productive of the particular effect by reason of its nature. In the case of ‘inclusiveness’, how could the one thing be productive and non-productive of the same one thing?—If there is difference in this case also,—the difference may be there; but is that difference from that thing only? There can be no difference apart from the ‘inclusive’ (productive cause); and this is non-productive. In fact, that alone is a real entity which is capable of effective action; and this entity is non-inclusive; and from what is inclusive, the effect is not produced. In fact difference and nondifference can be not-imagin ary (real) only in relation to that form or nature in reference to which the man has recourse to activity. Otherwise the difference is there by its very ‘nature’, and the ‘general’ character also is there being due to ‘exclusion the thing itself is not ‘inclusive’ (comprehensive); as in that case there would be most incongruous activities
In case the ‘variegated character’ of things spoken of refers only to conceptual creation (fancy),—then what would be the difference in the assertions made by ‘vipras’, ‘nirgranthas’ and ‘kāpilas’? 
When the pot is broken up and a dish is made (of the same gold), the man wanting the former becomes sorry, while the man wanting the latter becomes glad, while one wanting only the gold remains neutral. thus the thing has three aspects; and the said three ideas would not be possible if there were no production, continuance and destruction of things.”—[Ślokavārtika-vanavāda, 21-22]
As a matter of fact, there can be no sorrow without destruction, and there can be no happiness without production; and there can be no neutrality without continuance. it is in this way that the universal (commonalty) is eternal.”—[Ślokavārtika-vanavāda, 23]
This is not right; because of the absence of a common substratum; production, continuance and destruction cannot have the same substratum; for if they had, it would involve the presence at the same time of all these mutually contradictory properties. All this would be free from difficulties under the doctrine of ‘perpetual flux’; for why should any man be sorry at the absolute destruction of gold in the form of the pot? Why too should there be any joy at the production of the gold in the new form of the dish? As for continuance, there is none, of anything at all
When the dull-witted man perceives the two things made of gold, he looks upon it as a case of the appearance of similar products and thereby comes to think of it as something lasting.—If the gold itself had a lasting form, then that form, in the shape of the dish, could be perceived in its preceding and succeeding states also; or else, there would be diversity
When the dull-witted man perceives the two things made of gold, he looks upon it as a case of the appearance of similar products and thereby comes to think of it as something lasting.—If the gold itself had a lasting form, then that form, in the shape of the dish, could be perceived in its preceding and succeeding states also; or else, there would be diversity
On the ground of the gold continuing to be the same, when it comes to be regarded as something permanent,—some Buddhists also hold (on the basis of this) that the thing (by itself permanent) passes through diverse states
On the ground of the gold continuing to be the same, when it comes to be regarded as something permanent,—some Buddhists also hold (on the basis of this) that the thing (by itself permanent) passes through diverse states
Just as gold does not abandon its colour, even when there are differences in its state,—similarly under all its states, the entity does not abandon its character of ‘substance’.—If it were not so, then the cognition of past and future things would be objectless.—How again, is it that it has been asserted by Tāyin that cognition rests upon these two?—How again is action, which is past and has no further existence, held to be productive of results? How too could mystics have the distinct cognition of past and future. 
In this connection, there should be no such cogitation as to how this diversity in the states comes about. Because this distinction among the states is conceived on the basis of activity. that which is engaged in activity is called ‘present’; that which has ceased from activity is called ‘past’; and that which has not yet attained activity is called ‘future’.—The ‘activity’ of things serves only to ‘project’ the result, not to produce it. As there can be no such ‘projecting’ in the case of past things, there is no possibility of activity in them.” 
These people will have to admit that this ‘activity’ is either different from, or the same as, the object concerned; as there can be no other way in which it can really exist.—If it is something different from the object, then the past and future states of ‘present’ things would have to be regarded as formless,—because they are ‘causes’ and are ‘embellished’, and so forth,—like the activity. otherwise, the things would be everlasting; as the ‘form’ would be there all the time; and apart from this, there is no other characteristic of the ‘everlasting 
The idea of the eternal thing being a cause has already been rejected before—on the ground of the impossibility of its effects appearing either successively or simultaneously. as for being embellished, this is clearly impossible in an eternal thing.—When ‘activity’ is described as something different from the ‘phases’ and other things (postulated by Buddhists), there is the irresistible contradiction of your own doctrines
If, on the other hand, the ‘activity’ is not different from the entity, then, being inseparable from the entity, it would be there at all times, just like the nature of the entity; and in that case, the division among the states could not be made on the basis of this activity; as there could be no such distinction as that between cessation, and non-attainment, of the said activity
Or (conversely),, because it would be non-different from the activity—the entity, like the activity, would be devoid of the ‘previous’ and ‘later’ conditions, and would have its sole existence in the middle (present)
Activity is not there always,—and the entity is described as being there at all times,—and yet the activity is said to be non-different from the entity;—certainly this is conduct worthy of a divine being!—Even if it be held that the existence of the states (in the activity itself) is dependent upon other activities,—the same question would be equally well raised against that view also
Properties distinct from the entity have also been found to qualify it; for instance, the quality of ‘resistance’”,—if this is urged, this cannot help the matter under discussion; such characters as that of resistance and the like are not present in the entity at all times; they have been regarded as occasional; because the entity itself is produced in that way
It is the entity itself, when it does not indicate ‘difference from other things’, that is spoken of by the words ‘it is of the form’; just as ‘disposition’ is spoken of as ‘of the mind’
If the ‘activity’ is described as ‘neither same nor different’, like the ‘chain’, etc.,—then it becomes purely ‘illusory’; and thus being purely imaginary, like the ‘chain’, it could serve no useful purpose in regard to any effect; as it is only a real entity that is capable of effective action. Thus then, as the presence of the ‘activity’ would not be real, any determining of the states based upon that ‘activity’ could not be real
Firstly, the activity in question consists in ‘the capacity to throw out results’ and is capable of being spoken of; how can it be said to have an imaginary existence, when the capacity op things is an entity?—Secondly, the form that is admitted to be bringing about such effects as burning, cooking and the like,—is this same form held to be in the ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ states?—If it is the same, how can activity, inactivity and cessation of activity belong to the entity that has a single form?—How can these mutually contradictory modes be present in what is only one and undifferentiated?—If it is argued that—“because it abandons one ‘state’ and then takes up another, that entity cannot be undifferentiated, which passes through the states”,—then the question arises—are these ‘states’ different from the entity?—[The other party answers]—“no; as in that case, the entity would not be an active agent. because it is only through the existence of the ‘states’ that the existence of the effects is apprehended.” 
How do these people accept the view that there is non-difference between the entity and the states?—They (the states), not having been in existence, come into existence and then become destroyed;—how then could they be the same as the entity?—In the middle ‘state’, the entity is ‘active’ in its own form,—then, as the same form persists in other two states also, how could ‘activity’ and ‘cessation of activity’ be there in these two states?—If it is ‘active’, in the form of something else, then it ceases to be active again.—if, lastly, it be held that the fire and other things, in the past and future states, are different from the same in the present state,—then it is true that there would be no room for the objection that comingling and confusion would be involved; but even so, as the entity in the middle (present) state becomes capable of fruitful action only when it comes into existence after the time during which it was not in existence, and after having come into existence, it does not continue to exist,—there would be no continuity of existence for the entity
As a matter of fact, that entity alone is real which is capable of action; hence from that which is not so in the two states,—no effect can proceed
Such a past entity would be one that has come into existence, not having been there before, and as such it would clearly be ‘present’,—just like any other ‘present’ entity; also because it would be occasional.—If an entity has no cause, it can be either eternally existent or non-existent, because it would not be dependent upon anything else. That however, which has its existence dependent upon a cause must be called ‘present’.—Then again, other people have postulated that ‘modification’ of form, etc. is different in character from ‘pratīsaṅkhyānirodha’ (dissociation from impurities brought about by transcendental knowledge), and other ‘eternal verities’; and this ‘modification’ or embellishment of form and other things, comes about through birth, existence, etc.; now what is that peculiarity by producing which, birth is said to be ‘productive’ of the thing? Is it something non-different from the ‘unborn’ form? Or different from it? If the peculiarity is non-different from the form, then there can be no ‘production’ of it; as it would, in that case, be there even before the ‘birth just as after it. As for a different peculiarity, there can be no such,—because by reason of this difference, there can be no relation between them. Further, as it would not be existent before, it would involve the notion that the effect was not existent (which is incompatible with the opponent’s doctrines).—Similarly if there were ‘reversal of character’, ‘continuance’ and ‘destruction’ (brought about respectively by the embellishments of ‘decay’, ‘stability’ and ‘non-eternality’),—the objections based upon their being ‘different or non-different’, ‘decay’ and the rest, would be applicable to these also
These, ‘birth’ and the rest, are productive of their effects, in accordance with the limitations of their nature; and this capacity of theirs is there before as well as after; this potent form thus being there at all times, why should they not proceed with the activity in keeping with their nature? At the starting of such activity there can be no limitation on the ‘states 
Further, would the ‘past’ and other entities be momentary, or not?—If the former, then there is the same absence of restriction.—The ‘moment’ that is born becomes the ‘present’,—that which, on being born, becomes destroyed, becomes the ‘past’,—and that which is yet to be born becomes the ‘future’
If, ox the other hand, the said things are not momentary,—then that goes against your doctrine; under your doctrine it has been shown that all modifications are momentary
1833) The view in question is opposed to reason also: if the things are existent, they must be momentary, like present things. the invariable concomitance between these two terms has been already established before
Are these ‘past’ and ‘future’ things capable of effective action? Or not?—If they have that capacity, then they must be regarded as ‘present’, like other ‘present’ things.—If the ‘past’ and the ‘future’ are not regarded as ‘present’, then they must be devoid of all capacities,—just like the ‘sky-lotus’,—the ākāśa and other ‘non-produced’ (eternal) things are open to the same objection; hence these cannot serve to make our reason ‘inconclusive’,—in the case of all entities, their restricted capacity for effective action must be due to some cause; if it were without a cause, everything would be used for everything. In fact, the restricted capacity for effective action must be brought about by a cause; and there is no other characteristic feature of the ‘present’ thing. In the case of the ‘past’ and ‘future’ also, the said capacity is there fully complete, according to your view; wherefore then should not the character of the ‘present’ be attributed to them? 
As a consequence of this, all attempt to attain heaven and final beatitude would be futile; as no fruit is found that could be attained by effort
If, on the other hand, the past and future things are held to be without the capacity for effective action,—then, on that ground alone, they would be non-existent,—like the ‘sky-flower’, 
As regards the reasons that have been adduced, they must reside in things; and until these things are established, the reasons cannot be admitted.—Or else, on account of the ‘present’ character being established, the said reasons are ‘contradictory’,—as going against the nature of the subject
That form which, having come into existence, has ceased to exist, has been described as ‘past’ ‘and that which is to come when the causal factors are complete has been described as ‘future’,—if the ‘existence’ of this were insisted upon, then they must be regarded as ‘present’; this is what has been just proved; as the only characteristic of the ‘present’ is that it should be existent
When form, etc. are attributed to the past and future things, it is through imposing upon them their past and future conditions; and not in reality
When the seer of truth declared that cognition proceeds from two causes,—this teaching was in view of the cognition with an object
In the case of the cognitions of ‘eternal things’, ‘god’ and so forth,—there is no objective background; as words and names are devoid of the forms of those
It is called ‘cognition’ only by virtue of the presence of the nature of ‘consciousness’; and this ‘consciousness’ also consists in the cognition being not-dark which is deduced from its being luminous
What brings about the fruit is the cause of fruition,—not anything ‘past’, in fact, the fruit is held to proceed from the ‘chain’ of cognitions impressed by the entity (when present)
In view of the said impression being attributed to the ‘series of cognitions’, the lord has said that ‘there is karma’, which assertion is figurative; as the principal (of the debt) is said to be ‘not destroyed (lost)’
The matter has been explained in this way by the teacher, for the purpose of removing the notion of the utter annihilation (of past acts). Otherwise, how could he explain the teaching imparted in the aphorism declaring the ‘void’? 
The mystics cognise that form of the ‘present’ thing which, directly or indirectly, has become either an effect, or a cause; subsequently, they follow it up with conceptual cognitions, which are purely common (secular) in character, and which are really without objects (without a real objective back-ground).—Thus it is that, on the basis of the said past and future series of causes and effects, proceed all teachings regarding the past and the future.—As for the tathāgata himself, his teachings proceed without circumlocution; because the series of his cognitions are entirely devoid of the webs of conceptual content

If there is no entity that has continuity of existence, then there can be no ‘other world’, because there is nothing that could belong to the ‘other world’.” 
If there is no entity that has continuity of existence, then there can be no ‘other world’, because there is nothing that could belong to the ‘other world’.” 
The body, the cognition, the sense-organs and the rest being destroyed every moment,—they could not pertain to the other world; and there is nothing else that is admitted (by you, Buddhists). hence consciousness must be regarded as produced from, or manifested by, certain material substances,—just like fermented acids, liquors and such things.” 
The names ‘body’, ‘sense-organ’ and so on are applied to particular combinations of earth and other material substances; there is no other reality than these.” 
There can be no relation of cause and effect between the two minds (consciousnesses) under dispute,—because they subsist in different bodies,—just like the consciousness of the cow and the consciousness of the horse.—Cognitions (consciousness) cannot be the effects of the cognition (consciousness) in question,—because they are consciousness,—like consciousness connected with another ‘series’.” 
The dying consciousness of the man beset with affections cannot bring about the contiguity of another mind (or consciousness),—because it is dying consciousness,—just like the dying consciousness of the person free from the ‘afflictions’ (passions and impurities)”
From this it follows that the right view is that consciousness proceeds from the body itself which is equipped with the five life-breaths—prāṇa, apāna and the rest;—as has been declared by Kambalāśvatara.” 
To assert that consciousness resides in the foetus, etc. is sheer audacity; nothing can re cognised at that stage, as the sense-organs are not there; and consciousness can have no form other than the cognition of things; it is for this same reason that there is no consciousness in the state of swoon. nor can consciousness exist there in the form of a latent potency; because no potencies can exist without a substratum; and as there is no soul that could be that substratum of consciousness, the body is the only substratum possible for it. So that at the end, when the body has ceased to exist, wherein could the consciousness subsist?” 
When the other body has not been seen, how can it be understood that the required substratum is the body that is born subsequently? How too could the consciousness, residing in different bodies, be related to the same ‘chain of cognitions’,—being like the consciousness of the elephant, the horse and other animals?—For these reasons, as the substratum of consciousness, you have either to seek for a beginningless and endless transmigrating personality,—or accept pure materialism.” 
As regards the ‘other world’, there is no such ‘other world’, apart from the ‘chain of causes and effects, in the form of cognition and the rest what is spoken of as ‘the other world’ or ‘this world’, that is only by way of a certain limit placed upon the said ‘chain’ which is beginningless and endless.—We regard it to be thus, in the same way as people addicted to the pleasures of the perceptible only assume the ‘other world’ to consist in some other part of the country.—If what you are denying is the ‘other world’ different from those just mentioned,—then the attempt to prove that denial is futile; as there is no dispute (between us) regarding the non-existence of such ‘other world’.—Objection—“the chain being a non-entity, it cannot have different states; how then can the ‘other world’ consisting of these, be anything real?”—Answer—there is nothing in this; what are denoted by the term ‘chain’ are the members of the chain, spoken of collectively by that term for the sake of brevity;—just like such terms as ‘forest’ and the like
It is because it is conceived as ‘one’ (composite), and is featureless and incapable of being indicated either as the same, or as different (from the component members of the chain),—that the chain has been regarded as a ‘non-entity’:—just like the ‘line of sky-lotuses’.—As it is, why cannot the chain be accepted as being without beginning and without end?—If [it had a beginning and] the first member of the ‘chain’ consisted of the first cognition,—this could be held to be either (1) ‘without cause’,—or (2) as produced by an eternal cause,—or (3) as eternal by itself,—or (4) as produced from any substance,—or (5) as produced by any other cognition
1) The first cognition would appear at the very inception of the foetus, and it could not come about without cause; because otherwise, its existence, which is only occasional, would be quite the reverse (everlasting)
2) Nor could it be brought about by such eternal causes as mind, time, space, god, soul and so forth; because on that very account it should be eternal
3) On account of the absence of the said ‘eternal existence’ it would be sheer audacity to assert that the cognition is one and eternal; as difference is clearly perceived among the cognitions of colour, sound and other things, nor could it be produced from, or manifested by, the material substances—earth, fire, water and air; as, in that case, all cognitions would be simultaneous; as the other party regard these substances as of permanent form; and the idea of a permanent thing requiring the help of auxiliaries has been already rejected
If the other party assert that “these elemental substances are momentary (not eternal)”,—then, in that case, why cannot their own doctrine be regarded as rejected by this? 
The materialist might say]—“Let the doctrine be upset; we accept the view that all things are decidedly momentary, because it is a reasonable view supported by all kinds of reason”.—If your love for reason is so great that you have no regard for your own doctrine,—then you should accept also the more reasonable view that ‘primary elemental substances do not exist at all’
The primary elemental substances cannot exist in the form of composite wholes, nor in the form of atoms; because there can be no conjunction of atoms,—as is going to be explained
Not having any real external form, they figure in cognitions only through the fruition of dispositions; just as during dreams; they do not appear anywhere else
All these four primary elemental substances are assumed on the basis of what appears in cognition,—just like breams and illusions. and they have no real existence
It is not possible that what is something different from the cognation should figure in it; it is only a previous cognition envisaging the substances that could produce another such cognition
If the cognition in some other ‘chain’ be held to be the cause (of the first cognition),—then (the question is)—is that the ‘material cause’ of it, or the ‘contributory cause’?—If it is meant to be the material cause, then the learning and culture of the parents should continue in the child’s ‘chain of cognitions’;—that such is the nature of the material cause and its effect has been ascertained, through positive and negative concomitance, in connection with one’s own ‘chain—if, on the other hand, the cognition of the other ‘chain’ be assumed to be the ‘contributory cause’, of the first cognition, on the basis of its own material cause,—then there would be nothing wrong in it
Thus then the first cognition must be regarded as arising out of its own material cause,—because it is cognition and so forth,—like the cognition of the present moment
As other causes have been rejected, if the cognition were entirely without cause,—then, it could not have any particular character at all
The cognition at the moment of death is capable of bringing about its product,—because it is beset with affections, not having shaken off all attachment,—like the previous cognition
In the form in which the cognition produced a definite cognition in the past,—why cannot it, in the same unalloyed form, be productive of it in future also? 
According to the other view, the idea is that consciousness proceeds from the body itself; how then can the two corroborative instances be admitted to be equipped with the probandum?” The idea of the body being the cause (of cognition) has been already discarded, on the ground of its involving the possibility of all cognitions appearing simultaneously, on account of there being no other (contributory) causes.—As a matter of fact, it is found that cognition in the form of remembrance, affection and so forth (which are cognitions) actually proceeds from pleasurable experiences and pleasant reminiscences of the same [which also are cognitions];—and this cannot be denied.—Then again, it is also seen that deterioration and improvement in one’s later cognitions are brought about by deterioration and improvement in the practice of the learning and arts.—It is also seen that when the functioning of the mind is defective, there is no apprehension of other things.—On account of all these facts, the idea of cognition proceeding from cognition cannot be objected to
1902-1905) The reason—‘because they subsist in different bodies’—cannot be admissible. because how can there be any subsistence of the cognition, which is incorporeal and hence not liable to fall down, in the bodies? 
In the case of water and other things, the receptacle (container) would be there as serving to prevent their falling down. in the case of cognitions however, which are devoid of movement (and hence of falling), what would be the use of receptacles (or containers)? If then, the ‘subsistence’ (of the cognitions in the bodies) be assumed to be of the nature of ‘identification’ (sameness’,—that also cannot be right. because for you, cognition cannot be of the nature of the body
If the cognition is of the same nature as the body,—then why is not the consciousness (cognition) of love, hatred, etc. not perceived by others as clearly as the body is?—In fact, cognition is cognised by the cogniser himself alone, while the body is cognised by himself as well as by others. things that are so cognised are always distinct, e.g. colic pain and the dramatic actor
This reason is not admissible against the doctrine that ‘cognition (consciousness) alone exists’; as (under that view) what is cognised (by the cognition) is the appearance of itself; as in the case of the man with defective vision.—Further, cognition is always found to be destroyed immediately after appearance; if then, the body with the cognition is of the same nature as the cognition,—why is it not regarded as momentary? 
If the said ‘subsistence’ be held to be due either to the cognition being produced in the body as its substratum,—or to its inseparability from the body,—the reason put forward is wrong (inconclusive, doubtful). The body undergoing destruction every moment, the previous consciousness brings about an unbroken continuity of consciousness in such succeeding bodies. If, by reason of their occurring in the same chain, the two bodies be held to be not different from another,—then in the other case also, there could be no difference, on the same ground of occurrence in the same chain
Why has it been held that the consciousness of the person free from the impurities of the affections is non-contiguous? —If this view is held in accordance with the doctrine of others,—that cannot be right; because the authority (and validity) of these doctrines is not accepted (by the materialist)
As regards this matter, there are some wise persons who describe the Jinas (Buddhas) as ‘beings’ whose ‘nirvāṇa’ is not ‘absolute and final’,—and the two paths as aiming at that same path.—For these people the instance cited cannot be admitted to be endowed with the probandum;—even though it has been cited (by the materialist) on the basis of the doctrine of the other disputant
Inasmuch as no argument has been adduced as negativing the contrary,—there is an uncertainty regarding the negative concomitance (of the probans with the probandum); so that, there being a suspicion regarding the presence (of the probans) in the contrary of the pobandum,—the probans remains ‘inconclusive’
There is no audacity in asserting that ‘there is consciousness in the foetus’; even though the sense-organs have not appeared in it, why cannot cognition be there?—In fact the assertion that does involve audacity is that ‘all cognition proceeds from sense-organs and objects’; because the contrary is found to be the case during dreams.—In reality, cognition is apprehended also in a form which is distinct from that of the object, as is found in the case of swoon. from this it is clear that consciousness can be there in the foetus
Consciousness is not present in the foetus merely in the form of a potency; the view held is that consciousnesses are present there in their actual form.—Whence do you derive the idea that there is no consciousness during sleep and swoon and such other conditions?—If it be argued that—“the idea is obtained from the absence of consciousness”,—then, the question is—how has this absence been cognised? In case your idea proceeds thus—“we do not cognise any consciousness at the time”,—then that itself proves the presence of consciousness at the time.—It might be argued that—“if consciousness is present during the said states, then why is there no remembrance of it on awakening, etc.?”—This fact (of non-remembrance) is not effective (in refuting our view); the absence of remembrance is due to the absence of vividness and other conditions (in the consciousness)—as in the case of the consciousness of the newborn infant
If it is so, then how do you postulate the presence of this (consciousness) in these (states)?”a) We conclude this from reasons already explained before.—If the presence of consciousness is not admitted during the states of sleep, swoon and the like,—then there should be death; while if another consciousness is produced, then there would be no death at all.—Thus mental (subjective) consciousness must be regarded as independent, as it is not dependent upon the eye, etc. and it is present on the strength of its own cause, just as during dreams, etc
1928b-1930) 
For instance, conceptual cognitions are not dependent upon sense-organs and objects,—because they come about even in the absence of the functioning of these latter,—as in the case of the ‘sky-lotus’ and such things
That speech is hot there is due to the fact that the development (of the impressions) becomes hampered by powerful impediments,—just as in the state of highly complicated fever
In the case of those high-souled men, where there is not the slightest impediment,—clear speech is actually heard and they do have clear remembrance of them also
As a matter of fact, all these feelings of love, hatred and the rest become strong through habit and repetition,—as has been ascertained by positive and negative concomitance.—These feelings, appearing for the first time (in the child), are entirely devoid of any habit and repetition during the present life; what then is the cause of their appearance,—if there is no other life?—Their appearance cannot be due to the presence of their (external) excitants; because even when these excitants are present, the feelings in question do not appear, if there is disgust; and when this disgust ceases, they are found to be strong, even in connection with past and future things, when the counterfeelings appear in intensified form.—The feelings of love, hatred and the rest are found to proceed in regard to women and other things, when the man attributes to them goodness, devotedness and constancy and so forth; even though these qualities may not be actually there.—For these reasons, these feelings appearing in this life must be regarded as appearing, without the excitants being actually present,—through the force of the habitual appearance of similar feelings in the past,—because they are feelings of love, etc.,—like these same feelings appearing subsequently
When the objects are present, there appear pleasure, etc.; from this pleasure, etc. proceed the ‘afflictions’ of love, hate and the rest,—being the outcome of the fruition of the impressions left by similar past feelings,—in men who are devoid of wisdom and are subject to evil propensities (?)—In accordance with the potency of things. Directly, the objects are not the cause of the feelings; if they were, a single affliction would be the cause of them all,—in regard to the object,—like the cognition of things
The appearance of the feelings cannot be due either to the perception of the doings of others, or to hearing of things from other persons;—because such is not found to be the case always
Boars, bucks and other animals,—who have never seen or heard of the doings,—become perturbed at the touch of females of their own kind
If the apprehension of the object were apprehended by another cognition,—then it would mean that at the time that the object is apprehended, it is not cognised; because its cognition has not yet come about: and if that is so, then when again would it become cognised?—If it be held that—“it would become cognised when its cognition becomes cognised”,—then it would mean that the object which is not cognised at the time of its own apprehension, becomes cognised on the apprehension of something else.—This indeed would be an extremely wise assertion! 
If the said cognition of the apprehension is not cognised, then the preceding one remains uncognised. If of that also, yet another cognition were postulated, then there would be an infinite regress
If it were as suggested], then there would be no room for the cognition of any other object. And yet such cognition is actually found to appear. And if there is cognition of another object, the last of the series of cognitions could not be cognised by any other cognition; so that that would remain uncognised; and if that is not cognised, all the rest of the series must remain uncognised; so that the entire world becomes bund (unconscious).—If then, the first cognition be regarded as self-cognised, then the same may surely be said of the others also;—because they are all cognition; otherwise, they would not be cognition at all,—like the jar and such things
The eye is regarded as ‘illuminative’ of colour, because it brings about the cognition of colour,—not because it is its apprehension; what similarity then can the eye have to cognition? 
When there is cognition of a certain thing, and also that thing of which that alone is the cognition,—this thing is not-different from that cognition; or this does not differ from that. For example, the cognition of the blue, or the second moon;—and this is the cognition of blue, because it apprehends the blue form
The ‘nature of cognition’ not being the ‘nature of the other thing’ [according to the other party];—how could there be apprehension of the blue form, when there is apprehension of the cognition of the blue,—if there is no non-difference between these two? 
All this cognition does not envisage other things; there is cognition of the blue;—like the cognition of the cognition itself
Primarily, the cognition does not apprehend an object at all, as it rests within its own self; also because there is absence of the imprint of the objective form; nor can it be said to do so secondarily (figuratively).—This reasoning is addressed to those who regard cognition as imprinted with the forms of things, itself being like pure rock-crystal
Says the other party]—“the cognition endowed with similarity of form may be the apprehender of the external object”.—That also being impossible, it cannot have the position of the apprehender
As the form would be not-different from the cognition, there could not be a multiplicity (variety) of forms;—consequently, on the basis of that there can be no apprehension.—Or, the cognition, being not-different from the forms, should be many (multiple). if not, then how can these two be regarded as one and the same? 
If the cognition were entirely like the object,—then it would have the character of non-cognition (ignorance), etc. If there is only partial likeness, then every cognition should apprehend every object
How can the cognition envisaging (having the form of) one object apprehend another object? If it did so, everything would be apprehended by every cognition; and there would be no basis for restriction
just as your cognition, which is formless in reality, apprehends forms which are non-objective,—in the same way would it apprehend all things.” 
As a matter of fact, the form of the mind and mental effects is not-common (specific); hence there can be no apprehension of other forms in the real (primary) sense of the term; therefore the name ‘apprehension’ could be applicable to the apprehension of objects only in the secondary (figurative) sense, on the basis of such conditions as ‘being dependent upon the same causal circumstances’, ‘the relation of cause and effect’ and so forth. An entity however which has no form, cannot be ‘dependent upon the same form’, nor could the other condition be fulfilled. Hence of such an entity, there can be no ‘apprehension’, even in the figurative sense.” 
Or, it may be that the cognition is spoken of as ‘apprehending the non-objective form’,—through mistake, because in reality it does not apprehend it at all, for the simple reason that it has no object. If you also speak through illusion of the cognition apprehending such a thing,—then it becomes clearly non-objective
Whether with form or formless, it does not apprehend anything else; hence in regard to the Buddha’s cognition, the questions do not arise
If he had the cognition of the love and hate, etc. in other persons,—this could arise only from similarity to such love, etc.; and this would imply the presence of ‘obscuration’,—under the view of the ‘apprehensionist’
The great sage is like the kalpa-tree, unshaken by the winds of desires; and yet he brings about the welfare of men. Even though he has no cognitions, all men regard the blessed Jina (Buddha) to be omniscient; because by reason of the absence of limitations, he knows all things, without exception,—as is clear from what he does (for the welfare of people)
If the cognition is not of the ‘white’ and other forms,—then, how can it be the apprehension of the object? if it is of the form of ‘white’, etc., then what is the evidence for the external object? 
The fact of the appearance of the blue and other forms being produced by something of the same kind is sought to be proved by its being the form of the cognition which is in conformity with the reality,—like the consciousness.” 
a) if by ‘being in conformity with reality’ it is meant, either that it presents the external object, or that it has the capacity for presenting it,—then this cannot be ‘admissible’ by the man who denies the external object
b) If, on the other hand, ‘being in conformity with reality’ consists in being the cause of a cognition envisaging effective action,—then, this is possible also when the cognition is without an external objective basis
Just as in the case of the external things, water and the rest, the presence of actual capacity is regarded as the regulating factor in ‘conformity’,—this same ‘conformity of cognition’ is found in the case of other cognitions (inferential, etc.) also, so that, in view of what appears in inference, the reason adduced by the opponent is ‘too wide’ (hence ‘inconclusive’).—Certainly the form of fire and other things (inferred) which is quite clear and distinct, is not like that of the inference itself
That which appears in various places must be regarded as different from apprehension which is internal (subjective)—because it is cognisable, etc.,—like the cognition occurring in another chain”,—if this is urged [then, the answer is as in the next text]
2057) In this argument also there is ‘falsity’ (inconclusiveness); as there is no difference, in these respects, between the colour and the cognition; and there is ‘inconclusiveness’ also, in view of the ‘two moons’ and other things perceived by men with diseased eyes
If it is alleged that—“in the cases cited, it is really the external object that is cognised”,—[then the answer is as follows]:—the form that actually figures in the cognition cannot be of the nature of the real object; as it only figures in the cognition and hence becomes cognised; the actual form of the external object itself does not figure there at all. How is it possible that it should not figure there and yet be cognised? It is certainly a contradiction in terms to say that ‘one cognises it’ and ‘one does not cognise it’.—It is for these reasons that it is not difficult to prove that cognitions are self-cognised; because such is found to be the cognition in everything which is of the nature of ‘light’.—From all this it follows that it is not true that “the wrong cognition, while apprehending the object, apprehends it as otherwise than it really exists, and thus envisages itself (?)”
a) That which is the apprehender of colour must be different from what is apprehended,—because the cognition of the one does not appear on the cognition of the other as in the case of the apprehender of taste, etc
b) What is apprehended must be different from the apprehender; because one who thinks of the one does not necessarily think of the other;—as in the case of the apprehender of taste, etc.,c) For the same reason the two must, thus, be concluded to be different from one another, like taste, etc.,d) The two must be different, because they are never cognised as being of the same form,—like the cognition occurring in another ‘chain’
e) the cognition cannot apprehend any portion of itself; because it proceeds from the cognition;—like its own potency
f) There should be denial also of ‘apprehensibility’ (of the cognition by itself);—because the impression is devoid of the duplicate character
g) Caitra’s cognition cannot bring about the apprehension of the apprehensible part of the cognition arising out of his cognition;—because it is cognition;—just as the cognition appearing in another person.”—[Ślokavārtika-śūnyavāda, 172-177] 
Because the two are never cognised separately, as explained before,—therefore all the reasons adduced (by Kumārila); down to the ‘non-cognition of sameness’, should be rejected as ‘inadmissible’
The cognition of the form of the apprehended (object) is spoken of as ‘connected with external space’, and as appearing without the cognition of the apprehender (cognition).” 
As a matter of fact, people have such notions as ‘I do not remember if any object was apprehended by me at the time’, which shows that they remember the appearance of the apprehending cognition, without any idea of the apprehended object. If the two were non-different, there would be remembrance of the apprehended object also, when there is remembrance of the apprehending cognition;—as a matter of fact however, there is idea of the apprehending cognition only. Thus the difference between the two becomes proved by positive and negative concomitance.—thus all these reasons become established as residing in the minor term.”—[Ślokavārtika-śūnyavāda, 83-85]
As a matter of fact, there can be no apprehension of the object for one who has no apprehension of the cognition; hence there can be no apprehension of the apprehended object without the apprehension of the cognition
2074) The yellow colour is also clearly perceived by people with diseased eyes; and yet it is not apprehended as something differentiated from the element of the apprehending cognition. it should be the same in the other case also
The remembrance that has been cited certainly appertains to the apprehended object;—only its special features are not clearly remembered. the remembrance does not pertain to anything as distinct prom everything else; because repeated experience and other conditions cannot be there
If it were not so, then there could be no remembrance in the form ‘some object had been apprehended’; for remembrance is never cognised as a piece of pure rock-crystal.—The two last reasons (cited by Kumārila) also are clearly ‘inconclusive’, in view of such cognitions as that of the ‘yellow conch-shell’.—This is the way to deal with the other reasons also
For these reasons, the cognition under dispute must be without a second,—being devoid of objective and the active agent,—because it is cognition,—like the reflection
In the case of reflection also, the cognition is regarded as having an objective basis; as it is found that on the visual rays being turned back, one’s own face is seen as it is in the reflection.” 
It is not his own face that one sees in the mirror,—because it is seen in front of one’s self, and because what is seen is different in size, position, etc. (from one’s face),—like any other object
Being cognition’ is ‘luminousness’; and that can have no place in the ‘apprehended object’,—because it has no connection with the characters of ‘not envisaging a form’ and the rest;—hence its invariable concomitance has been duly ascertained
2082) The subsistence of the object in the apprehended aspect of the potency of the immediately following cognition is not regarded by us to be real. that is why the idea is supported.—The fact of the cognition being the only entity has been clearly established by clever writers. we also have trodden the same path for the ascertainment of truth

Other people, with intellect obscured by ignorance, have asserted as follows:—“It is not right that all this is mere idea (or cognition); because this is set aside by the revealed word”
Other people, with intellect obscured by ignorance, have asserted as follows:—“It is not right that all this is mere idea (or cognition); because this is set aside by the revealed word”
The said revealed word is authoritative for all, because it is not the work of a human being; because it is only words emanating from human beings that are found to be false.” 
In the case of the assertion of human beings, it is always open to doubt whether or not there are defects (in the speaker); in the case of the revealed word, however, as there is no speaker, we can have no suspicion of there being any defects.” 
a) An author or the Veda is not perceived;—it could only be assumed that such a one existed in the past [but such an assumption can have no basis]
b) When any relationship (of concomitance) of such an author has never been perceived before, any inference that could be made regarding him must be based only upon present ignorance; hence if such author is assumed (by the other party) it cannot be through inference
c) As regards verbal authority (scripture), that also cannot point to an author of the veda; because no other scripture is without an author; and hence any other scripture which is the work of an author, being itself unreliable, could not provide a reliable notion of the author of the veda. As regards the words of manu and others, their reliability rests upon the veda itself. As for any other writer who has no connection with the veda and is hostile towards it,—how can such a one be truthful on this point? Hence for us, there is no scripture compiled even by others which can declare an author of the veda
d) In case someone were visible now who is similar to the author of the veda, then alone, on the basis of that analogy, there might be an analogical cognition of such an author
e) If there were something vouched for by the means of right cognition which would be inexplicable if there were no author of the veda,—then alone, such an author of the veda might be accepted on the basis of presumption; as a matter of fact however, there is nothing in the veda which could not be possible without such an author;—on the contrary, if there were an author, there is much, in the shape of its reliability and so forth, which could not be duly cognised.—Thus then, being not amenable to the said five means of knowledge, the author in question becomes amenable only to the sixth, negation (non-apprehension): consequently, he is one whose existence is impossible,—as it is precluded by negation, which is the only means of cognition (applicable to him).” 
As a matter of fact, the idea of the Veda not being the work of an author is emphasised only for the purpose of showing that there can be no cause for unreliability; and as such an idea (being negative) is a nonentity, it cannot be proved by means of proofs.” 
When the logician asserts the fact of the Veda being the work of an author, the refutation of that fact proves the fact of the Veda not being the work of an author.” When there are two positive views regarding a question—e.g. ‘primordial matter’ and ‘atom’ as the cause of the world,—if one is not proved, the other does not become proved by itself
2098) Even after refuting the fact of primordial matter being the cause of the world, the idea of the atom being the cause of the world has got to be proved by other reasons
When a proof is adduced in support of the affirmative view,—if that is refuted, the negative view (to the contrary) becomes rightly proved by itself. thus it is that, when the other party adduce proofs in support of the two ends of the Veda, the upholders of the Veda have. their purpose accomplished by the refutation of those proofs.” 
As regards the positive fact of the eternality of the Veda, it becomes established for us on the rejection of the ‘two ends’ (of the Veda),—even though we do not adduce proofs in support of the said eternality 
The ‘first end’ of the Veda consists in the idea of its being the work of an author,—and the ‘other end’ consists in its being destroyed; and the negation of these (two ends) means ‘eternality’.” 
The eternality of the Veda consists in the fact that it is not produced in the beginning and does not perish in the end.—If it be urged that ‘even so, this eternality is something cognisable’,—then [the answer is that] eternality is what is meant by the two characters of ‘being not produced’ and ‘being not destroyed’; and both these being of the nature of negation do not require any proof for themselves.” 
One who asserts the falsity of the Vedic words on the basis of inference, has his proposition annulled by the force of the cognition derived from the Veda.” 
The knowledge derived from the Veda is of the same degree as perception, and hence stronger than inference; consequently, it can never be annulled by inference.” “Inasmuch as the Veda has been placed in the same position as perception, it is stronger than, and hence sets aside, inference.” 
There is a degree of simplicity in the validity of verbal cognition—due to the fact of its not needing a corroborative instance, and to the absence of defects,—which is not found in inference. Consequently, whenever there should be any doubt between verbal cognition and inference, it is verbal cognition that should be regarded as stronger, and the matter determined accordingly.”. 
While the Veda is clearly bringing about the cognition of things, the assertion that ‘it is not a means of cognition for me’ should not be made by a truthful person, by reason of sheer malice. It cannot cease to be a means of cognition, on the ground that there is malice against it or because it is not popular; nor can anything become a means of cognition, on the ground that one likes it and it is popular. Even those who are hostile to the Veda do not assert any reason why it should not be a means of right cognition;—by virtue of which they could be regarded as truthful people. When people, who have been intent upon the study, the retention and the exposition of the veda and upon the performance of acts enjoined therein, have not been able to detect any grounds of falsity, how can they be detected by persons who have kept themselves aloof from it? It is only persons who are fully conversant with a thing and who have their purpose centred therein that can detect the good and bad points of that thing. Those evil-minded people on the other hand, who are hostile to Vrahman and have been far removed from the Veda,—how can those people bare-facedly speak of the good and bad points in the Veda?”. 
Then again, the eternality and all-pervasiveness of the word, is established by auditory recognition;—who, then, could ever conceive of the contrary?” 
From all this it follows that the fact of its remaining the same at all times and at all places is proved by perceptional recognition; and this annuls it.” 
If it be urged that—‘in the case of such things as the flame, it is found that though it exists for one moment only, yet there is recognition’,—the answer is that it is not so; what is recognised in these cases is the universal, and that is eternal, for us. In cases where there is notion of difference in regard to any aspect of the thing, on account of certain circumstantial conditions,—there is no recognition, as is clear from the notion of difference.”. 
The notions of the individual cow-word, though diverse in points place, time, etc., must all envisage the same cow-word,—they do not envisage several words,—because they always appear in the form ‘cow’,—like the notion of ‘cow’ that appears at the present moment
2) The notion of the cow-word that appeared yesterday envisaged this same cow-word,—because it envisaged the cow-word,—like the notion appearing to-day
3) This notion envisages that cow-word,—for the same said reason,—like the previous notion
4) Both notions envisage the same cow-word,—like the single notion
5) All notions of the ‘cow’, divergent as regards place, time, etc., are brought about by the same cow-word,—because they are notions of the ‘cow’,—like the single notion
6) The cow-word that was uttered yesterday must exist today also,—because it is envisaged by the cognition of the cow-word,—like the same word uttered today
7) The cow-word that is heard today was heard by me yesterday also; for the aforesaid reason,—like the word uttered yesterday
8) All such words as are expressive must be regarded as lasting a long time,—because they bring about the cognition of the cognisable thing through the apprehension of relationships,—everything that does this has been found to be permanent,—like the ‘universal’ aspect of smoke
9) That which denotes things through the apprehension of relationships cannot be evanescent,—because it must have its relationship continuing till the time of use,—like the light of the lamp and the lightning.—Thus the idea of word-sound being non-eternal is annulled by all these inferences which must be admitted to be perfectly sound. Consequently it becomes established that words are eternal.” 
If the one-ness of the jar, that is urged as an undesirable contingency, is in reference to the ‘universal aspect’,—then the argument is superfluous.—If however, one were to urge the contingency of the individual jars being one, on the strength of the above arguments,—then it can be pointed out that such an idea would be contrary to all forms of right cognition; because the multiplicity of individuals has been definitely established by all means of right cognition, sense-perception and the rest.” 
If the relationship in question were artificial (set up for the occasion), then, as the particular use will have become accomplished and come to an end,—it would be applicable to that one particular case only, and would not be universal in its application. In the cow there is a commingling of several factors—such as the ‘earth’, ‘substance’, ‘being’, ‘tail’ and so forth,—there could be no definite idea of the ‘cow’ except through frequent repeated usage.—From this it follows that the word is not-artificial; and it never perishes,—because it has an eternal relationship with an eternal entity—like the ākāśa and the atom,”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 359-361]
Inasmuch as the word, heard but once, envisages several ‘universals’ in an indefinite form, it cannot definitely point to its own specific denotation, as distinguished from the other ‘universals’until it has been used several times).—As a matter of fact, the word ‘cow’ would get at the specific denotation of the particular ‘universal’ ‘cow’ only after a long time when it has been heard several times, and has thereby excluded the other universals—‘living beings’, ‘the quality of whiteness’, the action of ‘moving’, the universals ‘dewlap’, ‘tail’, and also the individuals, the ‘cow of variegated colour’, the ‘hornless cow’ and the like,—which are diverse by reason of their individual peculiarities.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words] 
And if the word existed for such a long time, who could destroy it after that?—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words].—For another reason again it is not possible for the word to be destroyed: in the case of the jar and other things, it is understood that they would become destroyed either through decay or through some weapon; there is no such cause by which the word could be destroyed.” 
Even though there are differences of place, time and user,—there is no diversity in the letter ‘ga’ and the rest; as the ‘recognition’ in their case is clear and distinct.” 
Even when there is diversity in the pronunciation being fast, etc., the individual letter ‘ga’ is not clearly cognised as an established entity, distinguished from the other individual letter ‘ga’.”—[Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 22]
The individual letter ‘ga’ has no existence apart from the substratum of the universal ‘ga’,—because it can never be apprehended by any cognition other than that of ‘ga’,—just like the universal ‘ga’ postulated by the other party.”—[Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 32] 
The same conclusion could be proved on the ground of its being a letter, like the letter ‘kha’.—As a matter of fact the contrary of this is never perceived; hence the said conclusion cannot be said to be annulled by perception.”—[Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 34] 
The entity in the form of the ‘letter’ is admitted by both parties; it is only right therefore that ‘eternality’ and other characters,—which are attributed to an assumed entity,—should be attributed to what is admitted by both parties. thus it follows that the one idea arises out of the one-ness of the letter. As regards the ideas of peculiar features, that would be due to the diversity in the character of the manifesting agency.”Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 18, 23]
One for whom both are amenable to auditory perception could have the dual notion; for you however, the pitch (of the letter-sound) being beyond the senses, how could the said peculiar features be due to the pitch?—[Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 38]
Some people assert that when a word-sound is cognised by the ear as affected by the degree of the pitch,—then it is that there is apprehension of the peculiar degree of pitch, brought about on account of its being mixed up with the word-sound.”—[Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 39]
Or, there may be no apprehension of these (pitches); it is only the cognition of the word-sound that is brought about through the pitch. as for the degrees of the pitch,—in the shape of intensity, etc.—they are cognised, in accordance with the impressions (made by the sound-pitch).”—[Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 40]
Those who have their minds perverted by the disorders of bile perceive the sweet as bitter, and white as yellow;—those who are running east, or sailing in a boat, mistake the hill and other objects to be moving; those who have applied the fat of the frog to their eyes mistake the piece of bamboo to be a serpent.—In the same manner, through the higher and lower intensities of the individuals, people have the idea of the universal as being the substratum of those intensities.—Just as, in the cases cited, people have the ideas (of bitterness, etc.) without having any perception of their causes (in the shape of the disordered bile, etc.)—So, in the case in question, without cognising the varying degrees of pitch in the manifester, there would be a mistaken idea of these in connection with the manifested.”—[Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 41-44]
The distinction in the letter itself into short, etc. would be contrary to the doctrine of eternality (of words); for, how can the letter, which is ever present, be said to be measured by duration? Consequently, it is the articulation of the letter that should be regarded as measured by duration, for one or two moments; the letter itself cannot be measured by duration.”—[Ślokavārtika-sphoṭa, 50-51 ]
The manifestation of word-sound by articulation is not possible: that manifestation could be due to the embellishment either of the sound itself, or of the sense-organ concerned, or of both. if it were the sound that was embellished, then it would be cognised by all as so embellished; and it being impartite and all-pervading, there could be no embellishment of it in any parts
Nor can there be determination of the embellishment through the diversity of substratum; because sound has no substratum at all,—like ākāśa and soul
If ākāśa is the substratum,—even so, ākāśa itself being without parts, there could be no embellishment in part, because the word-sound is always cognised as a whole
In as much as sound exists as a whole pervading over the entire ākāśa, it could not be cognised as a whole, if it were embellished in part
Under the view that the auditory organ consists of ākāśa, as the organ would be all-pervading, it would be equally in contact with all things; so that even when the sound is produced ear off, it should be heard here.—In this way the auditory organ also would be one only for all living beings; hence at the time that one person hears a sound, all men should hear it
As ākāśa, is without parts, the auditory organ could hot consist of akāśa as conditioned by merit and demerit,—which is essential for the two limitations referred to above
Further, the auditory organ, once embellished, should bring about the cognition of all sounds; when the eye is opened for seeing the jar, it does not fail to apprehend the cloth.—this same contingency may be urged also in connection with the remembrance of the thing (sound); as the embellishment appertains, without distinction, to the same space in ākāśa
The embellishment, when it comes, would come about by the removal of the immobile air-envelope; and it has been pound that when the covering envelope is removed, the apprehension of what has been there follows (as a matter of course)
The word-sound being one, it cannot be regarded as both embellished and not embellished; so that only one condition should be admitted,—no matter whether it be cognised, or not cognised, by all
The objections that have been urged against each of the other two views are applicable to the view that there is embellishment of both. thus it is not possible in any way that there should be any manifester of the sound
The author of the Bhāṣya has expounded the answer to the above,—on the basis of the idea that the embellishment pertains to the auditory organ. The diversity in the hearing by different persons is also due to the diversity of the organ.” 
Just as the lamp is regarded as the manifester of the jar, through the aid that it affords to the eye,—so (in the case of the word-sound) the articulation would be the manifester (of the sound) through the impression that it makes upon the auditory organ.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 42]
There should not be any such question as to the form in which the embellishment is made; as that question can be similarly raised in the case of the production (of the word, in the ear); as in that case also, the capacity (of the things concerned) is beyond sense-perception.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 43]
Why should any question or objection be raised against the capacity of things, which is always inferable from its effects? And the only proof for it lies in the fact that the particular effect appears only when the particular capacity is there”.—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 44]
Thus the conclusion is that it is by means of the imperceptible capacity alone that these (articulations) impart an imperceptible capacity to the sense-organ concerned, and thereby appear as causes of the manifestation (of the word-sound).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 45]
There are some people, according to whom the word-sound is apprehended by the auditory organ, when it is produced but not in actual contact with that organ;—for them, the absence of contact being equally present in the case of distant and near sounds, the apprehension and non-apprehension by people far and near would be equally possible; and there could be no order of sequence, nor the greater and less intensity (of sounds heard).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 119-121]
Thus, from the point of view of the vedic scholar also, let us examine the matter: it is an undoubted fact that (in speaking) the air within the body, on the impact of the man’s effort, issues forth; and in thus issuing forth, it undergoes conjunction and disjunction with the palate and other spots in the mouth; and inasmuch as the air issues forth with some velocity, it goes along as long as the initial momentum lasts it is also certain that, in thus issuing forth, the component particles of the alr come into contact with, and become disjoined from, the still air (through which it passes);—having reached the ākāśa in the auditory organ, this air imparts a certain capacity to that organ and it is only when this is there that there is cognition (hearing) of the sound; from whence it is concluded that there is a certain ‘embellishment’ of the organ, and this is the only imperceptible factor (that is posited). This would be exactly like ‘the capacity to produce’ (which is postulated by the other party).—Similarly peculiar forms would be inferred from particular forms of the cognition.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 121-126]
The interception caused by obstacles like the wall is quite possible in the case of air. the striking against the tympanum (of which we are at times cognisant) is due to the force of the air-current. and inasmuch as the air proceeds in succession and has a waning intensity and velocity, it becomes the cause of the sequence and varying grades of intensity of the embellishment produced by it.”Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 128-130]
We do not necessarily accept the idea of the auditory organ consisting of ākāśa; nor can ākāśa be regarded as being without parts:—because such an idea has been negatived by the Jaina and the Sāṃkhya.—Consequently the auditory organ may be a part of ākāśa, or it may be a distinct entity by itself;—thus there is a separate auditory organ for each person,—which idea is based upon presumption due to the fact that well-known effects cannot be explained except on that basis.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 66-68]
Even if the auditory organ (as consisting of the indivisible ākāśa) were all-pervading and one,—the embellishment due to articulation could affect only the material substratum of that organ; hence that man alone hears the sound the substratum of whose organ is affected by that embellishment.”Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 68-69]
Even if the embellishment affects the organ itself,—as it could affect the organ only through its substratum, that organ of which the ear-drum has not been embellished would not catch the sound.”—[Śokavārtika—eternality of words, 69-70]
There is no embellishment of the auditory organ, if and when the articulation does not reach the locus of the organ; thus the restriction on the embellishment becomes determined on the basis of the diversity in the substratum (or locus) of the organ.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 70-71]
The opponent may argue as follows—‘Having become embellished in one substratum, the auditory organ should bring about the cognition of the word-sound in all bodies,—according to one who holds the view that the auditory organ is one only (for all)’.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
The appearance of the cognition (of sound) is held to take place in the bodies of persons; consequently, by reason of the principal factor (bodies) occupying different places, the embellishment of the auditory organ is inefficient to that extent.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 72-73]
Even though, according to us, the soul is without parts and is conscious of all things everywhere, yet it actually apprehends the thing in the body only; and there can be nothing wrong in this explanation. [Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 73-74.]—On the same grounds does deafness also become limited in scope; it does not form part of the experience of another soul, because it is influenced by merit and demerit (which varies with different souls).—Just as when the village-lord has been removed from the lordship, though continuing to live in the village, does not enjoy the privileges of the lordship,—so the soul of the deaf man deprived of the auditory organ in the body, though continuing to dwell in the body, does not enjoy the experience (of hearing sounds), which other men are hearing.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 76-78]
As a matter of fact, the auditory organ, the sound and its substratum have themselves no parts,—and they do not exist at any one place; even so, our view is not open to objection.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 78-79]
The (vibrating) air-particles, which are the manifesters of the word-sound, have their different parts occupying different points in space; and there are different kinds of them also;—and it is through this that the embellishment becomes regulated.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 79-80]
Just as the air-vibration put forth for the purpose of one does not bring about another,—in the same manner, the air-vibration, capable of bringing about the embellishment for the apprehension of one letter will not bring about another.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 80-81]
One set of contacts with the palate, etc. serves to bring about only one letter-sound, not another; in the same manner the contacts bringing about one articulation do not serve to bring about any other articulation.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 81-82]
For these reasons—in the production and manifestation (of word-sounds), the diversity of capacity is equally present, in the effort and the desire to speak,—such diversity being presumed on the basis of certain effects (facts) which cannot be otherwise explained.”—[Ślokavārtika— eternality of words, 82-83]
Or, the idea that should be entertained is that the auditory organ consists of space,—which idea would be in accordance with the Veda [Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 150];—nowhere in the.veda has it been said that the auditory organ consists in ākāśa, etc.—In connection with dissolutions, it has been declared (in the Veda) that the auditory organ becomes dissolved into space; here we have the description of the organs,—like the eye and the rest,—becoming dissolved into their original constituents.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 150-151]
Just as, in connection with the visual organ, it is asserted ‘may his eye revert to the sun’,—which conveys the idea that the visual organ has its origin in light,—so, in the same manner, the auditory organ consists in space.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 151-152]
Space is one and all-pervading, and extends as far as ākāśa; when it becomes limited within the cavity of the ear, it forms the auditory organ,—in the same way as ākāśa does (for the other party).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 152-153]
The reasons that the vaiśeṣika can adduce in support of the view that the auditory organ is a part of ākāśa, will apply equally well to the idea of its being a part of space; with this difference that the latter idea has the support of the Veda.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
Thus then, the auditory organ consists of a part of the substance space, which is influenced by merit and demerit and which comes to be enclosed within the cavity of the ear, and it is this organ that is embellished (by articulation).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 154-155]
2203) “Even if the embellishment pertained to the object,—it would affect that one object only; and on account of the difference in the capacities of men, the sound could not be heard by all.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
Just as (under the opponent’s view) the word-sound, though produced and appearing equally with regard to all men, is not heard by all, on account of the diversities of direction, place and so forth,—in the same manner, (under our view also) the sound is heard only by one whose auditory organ is embellished by the articulations made near him,—and not by persons at a distance.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
2205-2206) “Inasmuch as the idea of the production of the word-sound has been rejected,—and as no other explanation of the phenomenon (op the hearing of word-sounds) is possible, it is concluded that what is produced by the articulations is the particular embellishment.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
2207) commentary. 
All that the fact of one thing appearing only when the other is there indicates is the presence (in the latter) of a certain potency (or capacity),—just like the potency in the auditory organ; and there the presumption has been allowed to rest.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
As regards the view that there is embellishment of both, the assertion that it is open to both sets of objections is futile. Because when sound is not heard by all, it is due to the deficiency in either one of the two.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
2209) commentary. 
Though the sun is one, yet it is seen (by one and the same man) as diverse in water and other surfaces at the same time; and yet it does not make it many; the same should be understood to be the case with sound also.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 178-179, though the reading there is slightly different]
Sound is heard in only a particular place, because it is dependent (for its cognition) upon the articulation that manifests it; and articulations have not the capacity to pervade the entire space; consequently, the word-sound is not heard continuously all over the world; and because the articulations appear in different places, the hearing is restricted to those places; and as the intervening spaces (between the articulations) are not filled up (by the articulation), there is the cognition of a break (in the continuity of the sound). And, as these articulations appear only in limited places, there arises the notion that sound is not all-pervading. Further, as these articulations have movement and a certain velocity,—from whatever place these articulations proceed, the hearer thinks that the sound that he hears also comes from that same place.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
The opponent says—‘by what cause are the reelected images perceived simultaneously as distinct in each vessel (of water)?’”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 179-180]
Our answer to this is as follows:—what actually happens is that by the light from the sūn scintillating in the water, the light from the eye (striking the water) is turned back in the wake of the reflected solar light, and thus it perceives the sun in its own region,—but there is an illusion of there being several suns of diverse forms, by reason of the diversity of the vessels of water. How then could there be multiplicity of suns?”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
When the eye is slightly pressed by the finger, even a single object is perceived as diverse,—because of the diversity in the functioning of the eye. the same thing happens in the case in question also,—according to us.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
Other people who hold the view that the reflected image is actually produced (as something different from the reflected object) urge the following objection:—‘If the same sun is seen in the several vessels, why is not the same seen as being overhead (over one’s head, like the real sun)? how too could it be seen below, in wells and such other deep water-reservoirs, if the reflected image were not actually produced there? Further, how is it that when a man facing the east looks at the mirror, he perceives himself as facing the west?’”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
When a man is looking at the sun and the water, his eye (rays) proceed in two ways,—one upwards and the other downwards; the perceiver does not perceive that sun which is illumined by the eye-rays proceeding upwards, because it is not in a straight line with the bodily substratum of the visual organ; while what is perceived by the downward bays is the sun shining above presented mediately (indirectly); and because it is the same sun that is so presented, the observer thinks that what is seen is ‘below’. It is thus that it is the sun itself that is seen below, through the intervening medium (of the downward rays).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality op words, 186-188]
Similarly (in the case of the man looking at the mirror), it is through illusion that the man cognises the face as facing the west, though in reality what he actually perceives is the pace as presented by the visual rays proceeding eastward to the rays proceeding westward.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 189-190]
Even granting that the reflected image really exists in the different places,—there can be no plurality of these images, because they are all apprehended by the same cognition.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words]
The idea of diversity due to diversity of place is inferential; while the idea that ‘it is the same’ is perceptional,—and hence annuls the former.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 197-198]
Just as the single person, Devadatta, passing from place to place, one after the other, does not become different,—so the word-sound also does not differ (simply because it is heard in several places).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 198-199]
2227) “And again, the same devadatta, whose one-ness is well known,—when seen again and again,—does not become diverse, on account of the diversity of time; similarly the word-sound does not become diverse on account of the diversity of place.”—[Ślokavārtika, eternality of words, 199-200]
If it be argued that—‘(In the case of Devadatta) the idea of his being one is not incompatible (with the fact of his being seen at several times), because there is succession (in the several cognitions of his presence)’,—then (in the case of word-sound also) please see that there is no incompatibility; also because the sound is all-pervading. in fact, the property that explains a perceptible fact may be accepted as belonging to all things.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 200-201]
When a large pit is dug in the ground, there is a notion of the ākāśa in the pit being ‘large’, and when the pit is small, there is the notion of its being ‘small’; in the same way there are similar notions regarding sound, which also (like ākāśa) is not something produced; consequently, the illusory idea that people have regarding sound (being large, increased or small, decreased) is due to other circumstantial conditions; as a matter of fact, ‘largeness’ and ‘smallness’ are never perceived as residing in sound; and the assumption of the ‘largeness’ and ‘smallness’ (of sound) is due to the greater and less keenness of its perception (hearing). As regards perception, it is actually found to be very keen if the object perceived—the jar—is illumined by a large source of light,—but less keen when it is illumined by a small light.—From all this it follows that such properties as ‘length’, ‘shortness’ and the like really belong to the articulations.” 
As a matter of fact, a word, whose relation shit to its denotation has not been apprehended, can never be expressive. If it were so expressive, then, each and every new word could express its meaning.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 242-243]
The cognition of such relationship of the word (to its meaning) could not be possible if the word were not-eternal; because, if the cognition of that relationship is admitted, it certainly proves the existence of the word at some other time also.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 243-244]
If the relationship has been recognised with one word, any other word cannot be expressive of that meaning (whose relationship has been cognised with another word). for example, when the relationship has been recognised with the word ‘cow’, that does not make the ‘word ‘horse’ expressive (of that meaning)”.—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 244-245]
If it be urged that—‘that other word also (which did not exist at the time of the convention) may be expressive through its own inherent aptitude’,—then, in that case, in the absence of any fixed rule, there could be no certainty as to which is the word that is really expressive.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 245-246]
If the use of words be assumed to be based upon actual expedience as to which word brings about the cognition (of a certain thing),—this may serve the purpose of the hearers of the word; it cannot do so for those who usb the word.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 246-247]
Without knowing with certainty (what word expresses what) how could the user make up his mind at the outset as to which word he should use? If, on the other hand, he does know it, then it must have been known to him from before.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 247-248]
Light is auxiliary to the perception; hence, even when newly lit, it illumines things; [not so the word].—[If it be urged that] in the case of the word the comprehension of the meaning of a certain word is due to its similarity to another well-known word;—then the answer is that so long as the similarity is not recognised, the word cannot be expressive (of that meaning)—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 248-249]
Which particular individual word would it be, through similarity to which another word would be assumed to be expressive? All these words would be equal, in so far as no one among them has its connection (with the meaning) previously known.—If it be held that—‘the word perceived (heard) first of all did actually have a meaning [and the expressiveness of the others would be dependent upon their similarity to that word]’,—then (the answer is)—how could it continue to exist for such a long time? As a matter of fact, a word is not comprehended as having a meaning until it has been heard twice or thrice.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 249-250]
For persons who have not heard other words (like it), the word, at the time, must be meaningless (inexpressive); that the same word would become expressive as soon as the man has heard other words, would be a wonder indeed!”.—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 251-252] 
No connection can be set up without pronouncing the word; and when the word perishes as soon as it is pronounced, it can have no need for any connection. consequently, as the word will have perished and would not have had its connection set up, the first word must be inexpressive (meaningless); how then could the subsequent word also, which has had no connection set up, be recognised as expressive?”—[Śokavārtika—eternality of words, 256-258]
The utterance of the word, the setting up of its connection and its use,—all this process is, by its very nature, successive; how could any one perform all this simultaneously?”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 258-259]
For those persons who live at different times and places, etc.—prior to the hearing of other words—there cannot be even one such word as had its connection set up.—Even if the idea be that the connection is ‘asserted’ (not set up or created),—the refutation of that also would be the same; as no such ‘assertion’ is possible in regard to what has perished, or what is non-existent, or what exists only at the present moment”.—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 260-261]
Which word would it be which the speaker would speak of to the hearer, as being expressive of meaning,—when he is unable to utter the word that has been heard previously?—He cannot speak of the word as expressive. He might speak of it as similar; but, in that case, it would not be possible for the hearer to recognise it as similar to that expressive word; because he has never heard that original expressive word; while the new word that he hears is not expressive. And when the man who is a speaker now becomes the hearer at a later time, the same difficulties would appear.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 261-264]
For all these reasons, the connection between the word and its meaning should be accepted as eternal; it cannot be based upon convention; as that is not possible in any way.” ‘The requisite capacity does not belong to the denoter (word) and the denoted (meaning), by themselves; the idea that people derive prom words is due to convention;—just as in the case of the winking of the eye.’—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 12]
Is this convention made for each individual mortal being? Or for each utterance of the word? or only once at the beginning of the world, by some one person?—Does the connection also (of the word with its denotation) differ with each individual? Or is it one only, for all?—If it is one, it cannot be artificial;—if it is different with each, there should be some idea of this difference.”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparīhāra, 13-14]
As thebe would be difference between the ideas of the speaker and the hearer (in regard to the connection),—the use of the word would become vitiated; as the idea of the connection in the mind of the speaker would be one, while that in the mind of the hearer would be totally different—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 21-22]
For the purpose of setting up the connection for the benefit of the hearer,—which ‘connection’ could the speaker have recourse to?—The connection which he has perceived before,—that he cannot set up for the hearer; while the new one that he might set up has never been actually found to be expressive..... If it be argued that—‘the same arguments apply to the jar and such things also’,—then the answer is that it is not so; because in the case of these what is recognised is the ‘universal’, whose existence has been already established;—even as regards the ‘individual’ (jar), that individual which has been perceived to be efficient cannot be set up; while that individual which may be set up has not been found to be efficient in bringing about its effect.—Even with all this, however, in the case of utterances, the potency or efficiency has been recognised on the basis of the ‘configuration’ (i.e. the ‘universal’).—This ‘universal’ can have no beginning; but your ‘connection’ has beginning.—If, in connection with that (connection) also, you admit of an eternal ‘universal’ (commonalty),—then our view of the matter becomes established. But even so, there cannot be a dual form. as a matter of fact, the ‘connection’ is only a kind of potency; and of this no diversity is perceived; it is always inferred from its effects, and as such, it follows the diversity in the effects.—In fact the potency is always presumed on the basis of the fact of something well-known not being otherwise explicable; and when this purpose (of explaining) has been accomplished by the presumption of one potency, there can be no justification for assuming several—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhakṣepaparihāra, 22-29]
At the time that the connection is asserted, if the word ‘cow’ is uttered, some people, being cognisant of the connection, comprehend the meaning,—while others do not do so, consequently, if, at any time, the connection were non-existent, no one would comprehend its meaning,—it may be argued that—‘if the connection were there, all men would comprehend it’.—But that is not possible; because (even though there) the connection may not be known to certain persons.”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 30-31]
The connection is only an indicator; hence (for its functioning) it stands in need of being cognised itself; it is for this reason that, though present, it does not do the indicating until it is itself cognised.”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 32]
It is often found that though a certain thing exists, it is not known; but it is never found by any person that what is absolutely non-existent is existent; because existence and non, existence being mutually contradictory, cannot belong to the same thing. There is no such contradiction between being known and being not known; because knowledge subsists in the cognisant person; and as personalities vary, there is no incompatibility; hence the absence of knowledge, as residing in one person, does not become excluded (by the presence of knowledge, in another person).—[Ślokavārtika-samhandhākṣepaparihāra, 33-35]
The white object standing beeore persons some of whom are blind and the others are not,—the object is not seen by those who are blind, while it is seen by those who are not; but this does not make the object existent and nonexistent.”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 37]
There is no incompatibility in this case, because there is diversity in the capacity and incapacity of men. in the case in question (of words) also, there is no cause of the perception (of the meaning), other than the connection.”—[Ślokavārtika-—sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 38]
Thus then, the ‘knowledge of usage’ stands on the same footing as the sense-organs; so that those who have the said knowledge apprehend the meaning, while others, not having the said knowledge, do not apprehend it,—just as the blind man (being devoid of the visual organ, does not apprehend colour).”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 39]
As a matter of fact, for all persons ignorant (of the connection), the connection becomes known through long-continued tradition,—and there has been no beginning of the connection.” 
Convention in regard to each utterance cannot be made by usage.—At the time of the beginning of the creation, there could not be any such action; and no such time is admitted by us.”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 42].—The view held by us is that the world was never otherwise than what it is now.—As for the ‘universal dissolution’, it cannot be known that there can be any such in reality. In fact ‘dissolution’ may be a name for the night only, when there is cessation of all activity; the lay in that case would be ‘creation because all sorts of activity proceed at that time. Or ‘dissolution’ may be there in the form of the destruction of particular countries or destruction of particular families.—There is no evidence for any such dissolution as consists in the destruction of all things.” 
As a matter of fact there can be no eternal creator and destroyer, in the shape of god or any such being, who, not having lost his memory, could set up the connection.” 
Says the opponent]—‘[Even though the letters may be eternal] the arrangement (order) of the letters cannot be eternal;—consequently what is expressive cannot be eternal. because what is regarded as expressive is the word; and the idea of the word is dependent upon the said order (of letters)’.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 278]
The opponent continues]—‘as, according to you, the letters are all-pervading, any particular arrangement cannot be inherent in themselves; because the arrangement is the product of articulation which is not-eternal,—It must, on that account, be non-eternal.—further, the said arrangement must be dependent upon the whim of the speaker, as it owes its appearance to his desire to speak. thus the eternality of the letters would be useless for you—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 279-280]
Words, without some order, have never been, known to be expressive; hence it is the order (or arrangement) which should be regarded as the word. for those people alone, according to whom the word is something different from the letters, and devoid of any order of sequence (or arrangement), can the assumption of the eternality of words have any use—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 282-283]
The contingency of the order or arrangement being regarded as the word does not arise for us. because the order or arrangement as subsisting in anything else has never been found to be illuminative (expressive).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 284]
As a matter of fact, the order or arrangement is only a property of the letters; it is not regarded to be a distinct entity by itself. the idea, in fact, is that what are expressive are the letters as cognised in the said order—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of letters, 286-287]
As a matter of fact, the order of sequence is not a product; because it is always accepted as an already established entity; the speaker does not adopt any order independently by his own choice; in fact, he always desires to utter the word in the same form in which it has been uttered by others in the past; and other persons coming later also utter it in that same form;—thus it is that this also is without beginning,—like the connection (of the meaning).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 287-289]
Thus then, even though the order is not something unchangeable (and eternal in that sense), yet it is eternal, in usage. and we have to make an effort to refute the idea of men being independent (in their choice of the order of letters used).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 289-290]
In the case of the letters however, such eternality would not be possible if they were not really unchangeable; it is only when the letters themselves are eternal that their order can appear through usage; just in the same manner as the jar and other things are made only when the eternal atoms are there; in the absence of these, the making of these things would have no basis at all, and none such is ever perceived.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 290-292]
The idea in the mind, of every speaker is always that ‘i am uttering words that have been used by other persons’; this in itself makes them eternal; and there is nothing for you that would be indicative (of a contrary conclusion).”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 294]
Just as in the case of the jar and such things, their use is characterised (and indicated) by the ‘universal’;—so in the same manner, the order or arrangement (of the letters) would become characterised and indicated through the ‘universal’.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 295]
Such universals as the ‘palate’, etc. are always present (in their universal or common form) in all men; and it is through these that the speaker emits the articulations;—and there are distinct universals of these (articulations) also, which serve to bring about the manifestation of the sounds, and there are as many of these as there are letters’—or it is the particular individuals (articulations) themselves as associated with the said universals that bring about the manifestation of the particular letter-sounds.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 296-297]
2293-2294) commentary, 
The order of sequence among the articulations would be due to the order among the conjunctions and disjunctions of the palate, etc.; and the eternality of both would be due to their respective universals.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 298]
Just as in the case.of moving about and other actions, there is an order of sequence, through the ‘universal’ subsisting in the various factors in the action,—so a similar order of sequence may be there among the palate, etc., the articulation and the letter, through their respective universals.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 299]
Or, the individuals (articulations) themselves, being extremely subtle in their nature,—there is cognition of the properties of the ‘universal’; and it is through this that there is cognition of order among the letters, even though these are all-pervading.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 300]
2297) commentary. 
Thus it is that the letters, following up the properties of the articulation which appear there as eternal, become expressive of diverse meanings.”—[Ślokavārtika—eternality of words, 301]
Says the opponent]—‘Though the word, the meaning and the connection between them have been proved to be eternal, yet so far as the validity (reliability) of the meaning of the sentence is concerned, that cannot be admitted.—[Ślokavārtika—on sentence].—it may be that the meaning of sentences has been assumed by the Mīmāṃsakas, without any basis, in accordance with the conventions of men,—just as in the case of such technical terms as guṇa, vṛddhi and the like.—Further, being in the form of a compilation, the Veda must be regarded as a human production, like a book of stories. And yet there is no reliable person (known, who could be the author of the Veda);—the Veda therefore must be regarded as unreliable’.”—[see Ślokavārtika—on sentence, 108-110]
The eternality of the sentence is to be asserted in the same manner in which the eternality of the connection (between word and meaning) has been asserted.—[Ślokavārtika—on sentence, 365].—Even though, in the case of the technical words like ‘vṛddhi’, what has been asserted may be possible because these deal with perceptible things; in regard to the Veda however, the idea of ‘conventionality’ is not possible; because by whom has the connection between heaven and the sacrifices (spoken of in the Veda)—which is beyond the reach of the senses,—been perceived?” 
It cannot be meaningless; as its meaning is clearly apprehendeda) “As regards the argument based upon the fact of the Veda being an aggregate, the counter-argument should be stated as follows:—All Vedic study (by any person) is always preceded by previous ‘study’ by his teacher,—because it is called ‘Vedic study’—like the ‘study’ carried on at the present time—[Ślokavārtika—on sentence, 365-366]
2341b-2342) “The argument might be urged in regard to the Mahābhārata also; but it is blocked by the distinct ‘remembrance’ (mention) of its writer. though there are such ‘remembrances’ in regard to the Veda also,—yet, they are all based upon ‘commendatory’ description”.—[Ślokavārtika—on sentence, 367]
The past and future times can have no connection with any ‘author of the Veda’,—because they are points of time,—like the present time as perceived.—It should be understood that Brahmā and the rest are not the makers of the Veda,—because they are persons, etc. etc.,—like ordinary me”
Thus then, it should be understood clearly that the assertion in the Veda is not false (unreliable);—because in the expression of its meaning, it is not dependent upon a speaker,—just like the word in the expression of the word-meaning. “The cognitions derived from the Veda must be right,—because they arise from the eternal sentence,—like the cognition of the sentence itself.—The arguments detailed before are all applicable here”.—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepa, 2]
2347). “The cognition brought about by the Vedic injunction must be reliable; (a) because it is produced by causes free from all defects;—like the ideas produced by the inferential indicative, or by the assertion of trustworthy persons, or by perception;b) also because it is produced by an assertion which does not emanate from an unreliable person, and because it is free from sublation at all times and places,—like the idea produced by the assertion of a reliable person”—[Ślokavārtika, sutra 2, 184-185]. (2348-2349) “It being thus established that the Veda is authoritative and reliable,—the longstanding beginningless line of teachers and pupils that has been assumed tends to prove that it is free from defects 
Thus, like light, the Veda being the ‘eye’ for all men,—the hostility that arises against it among some people, is like the hostility of the owl (to light),—and is the effect of their demerit”
Thus, like light, the Veda being the ‘eye’ for all men,—the hostility that arises against it among some people, is like the hostility of the owl (to light),—and is the effect of their demerit”
All this is the product of the false pride of the twice-born people. There is no truth in this, even by the slightest change
All this is the product of the false pride of the twice-born people. There is no truth in this, even by the slightest change
Even though there is no author, the Veda cannot be regarded as saying what is true;—because it is devoid of those excellences in its source which would make it truthful;—just as in the absence of defects, the word is not regarded as false, 
It is only in the case of the works of persons that the question arises as to whether the excellences are there or not. hence there is no need for such an enquiry in the case in question; and we have not the slightest idea of there being any excellence at all
Thus, inasmuch as the causes of truthfulness and falsity,—in the share (a) of wisdom and mercy and (b) of absence of mercy, etc.,—are not there, the said two qualities cannot belong to the Veda
Thus the Veda is reduced to futility,—like such sentences as ‘six cakes’.—If it be argued that “meanings are actually comprehended (from Vedic sentences), in respect of actions and active agents”,—[the answer is that] there may be such comprehension in cases where there are explanations supplied by men,—as in the case of the doings of Urvaśī,—even though the words (of the Veda) by themselves do not really convey any such meaning at all,—as held by you
Even if there be no defects, truthfulness does not become proved simply because the other alternative must be accepted; because there is a third alternative possible, that of ‘meaninglessness’
It might be said that—“the Veda by itself, independent of any personalities, stands capable of bringing about the true knowledge of things,—and it is on that ground that it is regarded as truthful and reliable”.—If that is so, that knowledge should be appearing incessantly,—because its cause is always there,—as at the moment intended.—Or at the time that one cognition appears, all cognitions provided by the Veda should appear simultaneously,—because it is an efficient cause,—as in the case of the intended cognition
After that the Veda’s capacity to bring about cognitions would cease; consequently the Veda could not be eternal. if the said capacity continues to exist, then the same cognitions should appear again
2362) It might be said that—“the Veda stands in need of explanations, etc., and as these explanations appear in succession, the cognitions (brought about by the Veda) are held to be successive also.” It cannot be so; when it is efficient (and has the capacity)—what sort of ‘dependence’ could there be? If it is efficient because of the presence of that on which it is dependent,—what hope, then, can you have of its being eternal? 
If it was previously inefficient, and is made efficient by the explanations,—then it becomes a source of knowledge through the help of personalities, and hence the work of a person
The Veda, as it stands, provides no knowledge to us, until it is illuminated (explained) by persons who act as lamps. Consequently there is no reason for the assumption that what brings about the knowledge of things is something which is not the work of a person; because the knowledge in question does proceed from the explanations provided by persons. Thus the character of not being the work of a person, even though it may be present in the veda, is of no use; because the only result produced by the Veda—i.e. knowledge—is dependent upon persons
If the Veda is always efficient (to produce knowledge), then why should it require anything else? The required knowledge would be forthcoming for you from the presence of that single efficient cause
Persons, being free agents, proceeding to explain the Veda, according to their whims, could never be checked by any one. consequently, being beset with such defects as delusion, vanity, etc., they might provide wrong explanations of the Veda.—there is room for such a suspicion
2370-2371) The other party do not admit any person capable of perceiving supersensuous things;—and the knowledge of the connection between heaven and sacrificial performance can not be obtained except from the (Vedic) injunction; because for you, there is no person who is capable of directly perceiving supersensuous things; as whoever has any knowledge of these has it only through the eternal words
The Veda, by itself, without any support, cannot always make known its own meaning; in fact, it stands in need of explanations by persons,—such explanations being like the stick held by the blind man
When pulled up by the explanations, the Veda might fall into the wrong path; and in that case, it would not be right to regard the Veda as the ‘eye’ (illuminating things) like the light
Even though by itself, the Veda may be able to bring about cognitions,—yet its validity (reliability) cannot be quite clear; as it is dependent upon personalities
The validity of a means of cognition is accepted on the ground of its bringing about cognitions in accordance with the real state of things. If then, the Veda depends upon explanations provided by men, the assumption of its validity (reliability) cannot be right
Thus, the Veda not having been proved to be valid, any beginningless line of pupils and teachers, even though assumed, cannot make it faultless
Because not a single person among them is held to be capable of perceiving supersensuous things; hence, even though assumed, the traditional line of pupils and teachers can be only a line of blind persons
2379) When a blind man is led by another blind man, he is not sure to get at the right path; hence the assumption of the beginninglessness of the line (of pupils and teachers) is entirely futile
As a matter of fact, there is no means of knowing for certain that this thing (the Veda and its meaning) has not been made (composed) by such later beings as Manu, Vyāsa and others
The validity and reliability of the Veda may be due merely to eternal connection expressive of true things; even so, there is no one who ever perceives that connection, which is beyond the senses. All that is expressed by the words (of the Veda) is supersensuous; hence its connection also must be supersensuous; while all human beings by themselves are incapable of seeing things beyond the reach of the senses
The Veda certainly does not say—‘such and such is my connection with the meaning’; as regards the ‘connection of the meaning’ that would be fixed by men, and would not differ from being ‘the work of man’
Just as it is suspected that what the word of man says may be untrue,—in the same way, may it not be suspected that the meaning imagined by man may be wrong? 
Even if the Veda is a reliable source of knowledge, the beginningless ‘line of pupils and teachers’ that has been assumed becomes like a ‘line of blind persons’
2386) “The cognition that arises in regard to heaven and such things, from the Vedic sentences speaking of the agnihotra, etc. is found to be free from doubt and uncertainty,—just like the firm conviction that proceeds from sense-perception. Why then should the Veda, bringing about such cognition not be regarded as reliable? It is for this reason that the idea that one derives from the words of the Veda is never doubtful and uncertain.” 
It is not so; because uncertainty does arise (in the case of the vedic sentence), just in the same way as in the case of another assertion to the contrary; and intelligent people do not perceive any difference between the two cases. In fact, in regard to things beyond the senses, there can be no certainty regarding their existence or non-existence.—If it be urged that—“this certainty does arise from the Vedic sentence”,—then, (the answer is)—why cannot there be certainty regarding the contrary of that, from another sentence? 
That Vedic scholars derive unshakable notions from the Veda is due to their minds being influenced by faith; and this is equally present in other people’s minds, in respect of other assertions, for example, quite as unshakable notions are derived by the Buddhists regarding trouble and suffering resulting from sacrifices which involve the killing of animals. Of this latter notion we do not find any sublation till now. If it be said that “there may be sublation of it at some future time and place”,—the same is equally possible in the case of the Vedic sentence also
If the Veda expressed its meaning by itself independently of conventions made by the whims of men,—then it might be valid and reliable. As, in that case, it would not abandon its meaning, even when explained otherwise by men with minds perverted by delusion, vanity and other defects;—and it would directly bring about the cognition of that meaning alone, and not express any meaning that may be desired by men.—If however, it depends upon the whims of men, then it does not differ from the common assertions of men; as in that case the expressing of meaning would be dependent upon men, and it is quite possible that it may be wrong
It is said that the Veda, not being the work of an author, has the inherent capacity of asserting what is true;—but why cannot it be suspected that what it says is not true? Just as its truthfulness is deduced from the fact that by itself, it brings about the cognition of what is true,—in the same manner it might be suspected that by itself it brings about the cognition of what is not true
Further, if you are really eager to regard the Veda as valid and reliable, then try and prove that it is the work of a person free from defects and so forth. If it is composed by a faultless author and is expounded in the world by faultless expounders, it certainly can be the means of obtaining the cognition of the real truth regarding things
The well-defined and excellent words of persons full of wisdom and compassion, even though emanating from personalities, are actually the means of true cognitions
As a matter of fact, the Veda cannot be regarded as a source of right cognition, simply because it is not the work of man. because it has been found that such things as forest-fire and the like (which are not the work of man) are the source of false cognitions
In the glare of fire, the blue lotus appears as red.—if it is said that—“in this case the fire is the cause of the wrong cognition, and is a product (not eternal)”—[Then, the answer is as in the following text]
Does the ‘character of being a product’ make things the source of wrong cognitions? In that case, smoke would not be the correct indicator of fire
Thus, even though not the work of a person, the Veda cannot be the source of right cognition; hence the assumption of it is entirely futile
From all this it follows that the reasons in support of (1) the Veda not being the work of a person, (2) of there being only a ‘manifestation’ of it, and (3) of its being eternal,—as also (4) of the eternal connection between the words and its meaning,—have all been set forth uselessly. Because, even if the Veda has all this character, it cannot be accepted to be the source of true knowledge; as has been just stated in detail. Hence we are not paying much attention to the refutation of this idea (of the Veda not being the work of a person). Who would ever care to refute what has no bearing upon the matter under consideration? 
The question that is being considered now is the idea of the Veda being the source of right knowledge; and it has been proved that it cannot be so, even if it be not the work of a person.—What little is said in this connection (by the other party) in sheer vanity,—all that vanishes in this same way, for all men of keen intellectual vision
The absence of the means of cognition does not necessarily mean the absence of the object of cognition; because the latter are not causes with which the former is invariably concomitant
Thus, even though not cognisable by the five means of cognition, the author of the Veda is not amenable to ‘non-apprehension’ (negation) alone;—he being just like the author of the story-book whose author is not known
If the author of these story-books is inferred from the fact of their being expressive of distinctly clear meanings,—then why cannot the same be done in regard to the Veda also? 
As regards his being not cognised by all beings,—that is always doubtful; as it is possible that at some time by some means of cognition, he might become cognised by some one. Because that he is so uncognisable cannot be clearly ascertained by all living beings of all the three worlds coming together without exception.—As regards his being not cognised by the Mīmāṃsaka himself, it is clearly ‘inconclusive’, because that does not prove with certainty that there is no cognition by other persons
It is through perception that the readers of the Veda are recognised as the ‘makers’. It cannot be right to regard them as ‘manifesters’; because the ‘manifestation’ of eternal things is impossible
The Vedas being perceptible in their character, there is appearance of them when there is operation of the ‘manifester’: if they existed even before that operation, then they should be perceptible at that time also
The Veda is recognised as capable of being, treated as the effect produced by the ‘manifester’,—because it appears only when this latter is present;—like the sprout in the presence of the seed
Because they appear in the sequential form in which they become manifested,—like dramas and stories,—the Vedas must be the work of an author; thus the author is cognised by means of inference also
Otherwise [if the Veda were not the work of a person],—as the Veda would be eternal and all-pervading, there could be no sequential order in it. as a matter of fact, there can be no sequence in what is eternal; as there can be no ‘manifestation’ of it
It has been shown that ‘verbal authority’, ‘analogy’ and ‘presumption’ cannot be the means of bight cognition;—hence it cannot be right to bring these forward
If the idea of the Veda being without an author is insisted upon, in order to remove all chances of its unreliability,—then, such an idea, being a positive entity, must be established by means of proofs
2424) The Veda is regarded to be self-sufficient,—because it does not depend upon the action of any person; and the said self-sufficiency must be either the property of a positive entity only, or such a positive entity itself
If certain proofs are adduced in support of the view that there is an author of the Vedas,—if these proofs are refuted, it does not necessarily follow that there is no such author. In fact on the refutation of the proof of his existence, what follows is that there is no certainty regarding his existence; similarly the mere setting aside of the idea of his existence is not enough to bring about any certainty at all.—As a matter of fact, even on the cessation of the means of cognition, there is no certainty regarding the nonexistence of the thing concerned; hence all that it can prove is that there is no certainty regarding either of the two views
For instance, when on the ground of ‘incorporeality’, the other party seeks to prove the eternality (of word-sounds),—and against this it is pointed out that, in view of pleasure, which also is ‘incorporeal’ (and yet not-eternal), the said reason is ‘inconclusive’,—it does not necessarily follow (from this counterargument) that the word-sound is perishable
Thus then, when a proof has been adduced in support of the two ends of the Veda,—by the refutation of that proof, the upholders of the Veda do not have their purpose accomplished
If ‘eternality’ is what is meant by being not produced and being not destroyed,—then, inasmuch as both would be of the nature of mere negation,—the same may be said regarding the non-entity also. consequently, just as the eternality of the ‘sky-lotus’ is not real, in the same way the reliability of the Veda also does not become established
Even the denial of the characters of being produced and being destroyed cannot be admitted; as it has been said that ‘the proof is set aside’. Hence eternality does not become established
If the two characters meant to be the reasons for eternality are of the nature of relative negation,—then, partaking of the nature of affirmation, they do stand in need of proof for themselves.—Thus, for people who do not wish to prove ‘eternality’ as a real entity, the said eternality does not become proved merely by the rejection of the two contrary views
The reason that has been adduced by us in its three-fold form,—cannot be refuted even by your father
The person who has been spoken of in the Veda as ‘not perishing’,—the denial of such a person through inference has been clearly set forth in the section where ‘the no-soul doctrine’ has been expounded.—The ‘universal’ and other things also have been shown there to have been discarded. The inference based upon well-recognised invariable concomitance, as explained before, is what sets aside the soul
When the inference is firmly based upon the nature of things—who would be the stupid person who would discard it on the strength of mere words,—or by the cognition born of such words? 
When a cognition proceeds from the words of a human-being, in regard to something beyond the senses,—why do you not regard it to be as reliable as that derived from sense-perception? 
Both cases are equally independent of the need of a corroborative instance,—and both are equally free from defects,—because both relate to something- imperceptible.—It might be urged that—‘in the case of the human assertion, its sublation or denial would be suspected, on the ground of its proceeding from a human being’.—If that be so, then in the case of the Vedic assertion also, the said suspicion cannot be entirely absent; it would be considered only natural that it should be the source of false notions
While the word (human) is clearly bringing about the cognition of things, no right-minded person should say, through sheer malice, that it is human (and hence unreliable)
Thus in the matter of super-sensuous things, all words are of equal strength and weakness; why then should you be in love with only one kind of them? 
The principle just explained forms the reason why it is asserted by the wise that the Veda cannot be regarded as a means of right cognition. And in this they say what is perfectly true
There is nothing strange in the fact that people, whose intelligence has been dulled by the constant contemplation of the Veda, prompted by false attachment, have failed to detect the sources of falsity (in the Veda). The Pārasīka people who are addicted to the practice do not perceive anything wrong in the remarriage of their mothers
The idea of ‘recognition being of the nature of perception’ has been already discarded; and as wrong cognition is always associated with ‘conceptual content’, there can be no certainty regarding eternality
The idea that there appears in regard to word-sounds is found to be mostly divergent; as it is often cognised in such forms as ‘this is spoken by the parrot’ and ‘this other is spoken by the Śārikā’,—if it is said that “this is due to the diversity of the manifesters of the sounds”,—then, we shall state the reasons for rejecting this idea of the ‘manifestation’ (of sounds). On this ground alone, all this would be one and the same. Hence there can be no manifester, and no manifested. Because when the thing is one and indivisible, that fact precludes all notions of diversity.—Further, there can be no determination, based upon recognition, that ‘these words are human’ and ‘those others are not uttered by men 
Some words are found always in one and the same order of sequence,—the order of the manifested being fixed; these words are held to be not-human, appearing, as they do, always in the same fixed order of sequence.” 
As a matter of fact, the order of sequence in the manifesting agencies, palate and other speech-centres—is something that appertains to men; hence it is possible that it may be otherwise
The idea of any such ‘universal’ as ‘fire’ has been rejected in detail. hence the ‘universal’ that is recognised cannot be eternal
2455) Such recognition is possible in the case of letters also, which are perishable,—for those who hold that the universal can be recognised. That element wherein there appears the notion of difference,—like slow, fast and so forth,—in regard to these there can be no recognition...... (?) 
In the reasons that have been put forward in proof of the idea of the one-ness of the word,—there is no invariable concomitance possible; because they are not incompatible with the contrary
As regards the ‘universal aspect of smoke’...... [lacuna in: the text]..... your argument is ‘superfluous’
If the one-ness of the letters ga, etc. that is urged as an; undesirable contingency, is in reference to the ‘universal aspect’, then the argument is superfluous; because the aspect of ‘exclusion of the unlike’ is already postulated by us as one and the same in all individuals.—If the individuals themselves were, urged to be one and the same, then the reason would be ‘inconclusive’; because the multiplicity of the individual letter has been definitely recognised, in every use of them, by means of sense-perception, etc
Diversity in the form of ‘agreeable’ and ‘disagreeable’ and so forth, is directly perceived;—the diversity among cognitions is cognised on the ground of their appearing in succession,—as in the case of the virgin,—the cognitions of the individual ‘cow-words’, appearing at different times and places, cannot all denote one and the same object,—because they actually appear as diverse,—like the cognitions of taste, colour, etc.—The diversity in the cognitions of the various notes (of sound) in the shape of the ‘ṣaḍja’ and the rest is cognised by perception..... as is going to be explained later on
All these cognitions of the ‘cow-word’, which appeared yesterday and to-day, cannot all envisage the same object,—like the successively appearing cognitions of colour and odour, etc
If it were not so, then all cognitions would have one and the same object; there would be incongruity also as regards their appearing in succession, when their efficient cause is there all the time
It has been explained before that even though there is diversity among things, yet they have the inherent capacity of being conceived as one, with certain restrictions.—But even with such conception, there can be one-ness, etc. of the word. What the common man thinks is that there is repeated use of one and the same word.—The relationship also is possible when subsisting in several individuals. Consequently in all cases, there is a multiplicity of words, but they come to be conceived of as one
In reality, there can be no relationship between the word and its meaning; (a) because there is difference between them,—and (b) because one is not born from the other. The relationship has only been imposed by people under an illusion.—That this is so has been explained in detail already. In fact, the whole position of the word and its meaning is highly complicated; as there is no invariable concomitance between them
Any such eternal universal as ‘cow’ has been already rejected; the relationship also is purely imaginary; the ‘ākāśa’ and the ‘atom’ also have been discarded. hence neither the probans nor the corroborative instance is sound
You may take a long time in explaining the fact of the word (‘cow’) being expressive of the one universal ‘cow’, as extracted (from among the several universals); on the basis of deluded people cognising it in one and the same form
2473) In reality, the thing is momentary; hence even for that time it cannot remain stationary; how then can it be admitted to exist at the subsequent time? In the case of the jar and other things also, there is no cause for their destruction, which can be clearly pointed out as ‘this is what will destroy it’; how, then, can any such cause be pointed out in the case of the word? 
That there is mistake in recognitions has already been explained before.—The ‘property’ varies with the variations of place, time and persons using (the word); and the variations appear in the shape of the various notes, ṣaḍja, ṛṣabha, gāndhāra, pañcama and so forth;—the cogniser also is perceived directly; the individual letter ‘ga’ is also clearly distinct.—All this diversity cannot be regarded as due to the diversity in the ‘manifester’; that there can be no ‘manifestation’ in the case of eternal things is going to be explained later on
The universal ‘ga’ is not held to be something real, distinct from the letter ‘ga’; hence the charge of ‘futility’ is irresistible, as against the Mīmāṃsaka’s reasoning
If it be urged that what is sought to be proved (by the mīmāṃsaka’s argument) is that it is not the substratum of the universal ‘ga’, which is of the nature of the ‘exclusion of others’,—that cannot be right; as that will involve the fallacy of the basis of the reason being ‘inadmissible’.—Inasmuch as the letter ‘ga’ is nothing apart from ‘the exclusion of the non-ga’, to which object would the character of ‘being not apprehended by any cognition other than that of ga’ belong? 
Every right inference requires such corroborative instance, etc, as are admitted by both parties. in the case of the inference in question however, the objective basis (of the reason) is not so admitted
All, this attempt of yours is for the purpose of proving the oneness of the letter ‘ga’; and this is clearly and undeniably annulled by perception, as already explained to you
All these cognitions of the letter ‘ga’ which appeared yesterday and today, etc. appearing in succession, cannot envisage one and the same thing,—like the cognitions of taste, colour, etc.—Thus the ‘one letter’ is not something ‘admitted by both parties hence the ‘eternality’ that has been assumed appertains to the postulated ‘exclusion of others’
At the time that the word-sound is heard, there is no perception of the air-currents reaching the ear and embellishing the auditory organ. when the sound is cognised through the ear as embellished by the pitch,—there is idea of the pitch as related to that sound; and this idea is clearly annulled by direct perception
Just as the notion of ‘bitterness’ with regard to what is ‘sweet’, and of ‘yellow’ with regard to what is ‘white’, is without an objective basis,—of the same kind would the notion of the word-sound also be
Under the variations of ‘fast’, ‘middling’ and ‘slow’,—the word-sound itself does not appear as different. under the circumstances, when the cognition envisages something in a form that does not belong to it,—why should not this cognition be objectless? 
The assertion that ‘one cognises the one thing as otherwise’ involves self-contradiction; i.e. what is cognised is another form, then how can the same object be said to be cognised? under the view that cognition is formless, it would exist only in the external form; consequently, if what is cognised is external and yet not of the nature of the external thing,—then how is it that it exists? Even under the view that cognitions have forms, the cognition always appears in accordance with the external form; and then alone is the object said to be ‘cognised’.—in the case in question, however, the cognition does not appear in accordance with the external form.—Hence it follows that all this cognition, which is wrong, is entirely objectless 
It cannot be right that there should be a ‘manifester’,—specially for what is eternal,—in accordance with its embellishments (and modifications); consequently there cannot be diverse cognitions in regard to the word-sound
Under the view that ākāśa is one and all-pervading, there can be no such division as that the one is the substratum of the embellished organ and the other is not so; because ākāśa is one (and indivisible).—If the auditory organ consists of the one ākāśa, then it cannot have its tympanum ‘unembellished’. Consequently, any restriction in the embellishment on the basis of the substratum cannot stand. Consequently, when the organ has secured the embellishment in one substratum, it should bring about the cognition in the bodies of all men;—according to those who declare the organ to be one only. You may hold that cognitions (sensations) appear in the various parts of the bodies of men; but according to you, there can be no diversity of place for the principal factor, in relation to ākāśa which is one only.—The other party might say—“according to us, the soul is without parts, indivisible, and it is in its entirety that it cognises things, and yet it actually apprehends if in the body only”;—but even with this, the view is open to objection: there would, in this case, be no such distinctions as that of the ‘deaf’ and the like, and for the same reason it would not be possible for one cognition not to be apprehended by another soul; as there is no difference between the two
When it cannot abandon its previous form, and when no new features can appear in it,—why cannot the auditory organ come within range of the experience of another
How could the auditory organ come within the range of one’s experience, through the influence of charms and medicines, etc.? Being eternal, it cannot derive any peculiarities from these
even though the substratum is not-eternal, its non-eternality would not be of the nature of momentariness”;—if this is urged, then (the answer is that), inasmuch as no additional properties could be produced in it, deafness, etc. would not be possible
Or, the additional property may be produced in the organ; but in no case could it exist in the ākāśa; nor could it be due to its connection with its receptacle; because it is eternal and independent. Hence, deafness, etc. could not come about through that either.—Even if ākāśa were with parts and divisible, the arguments would apply to it, on the ground of its eternality
Even for you, this ‘removal from the ownership’ cannot be possible,—unless the ownership is momentary. what additional property has been produced in it, by virtue of which it is removed from the ownership and does not enjoy the same experience again? 
Thus then, there is no ‘embellishment’ possible, either in the auditory organ or in the word-sound; because it is not possible for the embellishment to be either different or non-different (from them). For instance, if the embellishment is something different from the auditory organ and the sound, then these two cannot be regarded as ‘embellished’; as these would have no relationship with the embellishment; because between two different things, the only relationship possible is the causal one; and if this relationship were there, then the embellishment would be there at all times, as its cause would be there at all times.—Even under the view that the embellishment is not something different,—it would be eternal, like the auditory organ and the sound; and hence it could not be produced by anything; consequently the cognition (due to the embellishment) would be everlasting.—Because all this is so, therefore any regulation or restriction of the capacity of the air-currents, etc. cannot be possible; and when what is to be accomplished is not present, the capacity to accomplish it can be of no use
Thus,—inasmuch as no ‘manifestation’ (of the word-sound) is possible,—the cognition of the word-sound must be regarded as having this character that it is invariably concomitant with the birth (coming into existence) of what is apprehended by it,—like the cognition of the individual jar and such things.—Consequently, both ‘producing’ and ‘manifesting’,—as brought about by effort and articulation,—will have the diversity of their capacity determined by presumption based upon the nature of the effects produced by them
All those reasons that go to invalidate the view that the auditory organ is part of ākāśa, should be understood by intelligent men to apply also to the view that it is part of space
2561) The assertion that—“if the embellishment pertains to the object, it would affect that one object only”—cannot be right; because it has been discarded; also because the capacity of things is limited.—Hence there cannot be embellishment of the object
If the word-sound did not possess the capacity to produce cognitions, then it could never be cognised by anyone anywhere; as it could not have any bearing upon its cognition.—If, on the other hand, it did possess the capacity, then it would be cognised by all men, at all times and at all places; as it would continue to be the cause of that cognition
If the word-sound is, by its very nature, definitely capable or incapable,—what hostile or helpful force could set it aside? 
As a matter of fact, when the word-sound appears, it is capable of producing its cognition in some persons only; hence when it is produced, it is not cognised by all men.—Or, how could it be that the sound is heard only by those men in close proximity to whom it is embellished by articulations,—and not by those at a distance? 
Even in cases of proximity, the embellishment is supposed to be the cause (of the cognition); and this embellishment would be equally there for persons at a distance also
2568) If the idea is that particular embellishments are produced by articulations, then in that case, no one can deny the idea of the sound being produced. Because the particular embellishment is not something different from the word-sound; otherwise the word-sound would be incognisable. consequently the word-sound also should be regarded as produced
Having become embellished once, if the word-sound does not abandon that (embellished) form, on account of its evanescent character,—then it should continue to be heard for all time
Even as regards the view that there is embellishment of both, the assertion that it is open to both sets of objections is quite true; because deficiency is not in one of the two only; as the previous one continues
The auditory organ and the letter-sounds that have been previously embellished by the manifesters cannot become destroyed,—because if they did, they would be non-eternal; and consequently they would be heard at all times
If the embellished organ and letter-sounds were capable of hearing by a few limited persons, then there would be no hearing for other persons who would be going to hear the same letter-sounds
If it be said that—“the organ and the letter-sound are embellished again, and are pit for the purpose of the cognition of that sound by other persons”,—then also there would be continuation of the same organ and sound, and hence of the hearing also of the same sound and by the same person
If these other organ and letter-sound are distinct (from those embellished before),—then why does not the hope of these being eternal become entirely baseless? 
In the water and other reflecting substances, it is not the same sun seen in various forms; because the cognitions that are there all pertain to the reflected images, and are entirely devoid of any objective basis
Even under your view, all cognitions are formless, and it is only the external thing that is held to be with form. The reflected image that is seen is seen within the water; and yet the sun existing in the sky is not there in the water.—“How is it then that it appears as if in the water?”—It is through delusion, and hence it is that it is clearly devoid of an objective basis; because it has no connection with any object with that form.—If it is urged that “it is the same sun that is perceived otherwise”,—this would be another excellent assertion—the same and yet otherwise.—But in this way, every cognition would apprehend everything. It would be the cognition of the same sun only if it were seen exactly as it is; when however, it is actually perceived in another form, how could it be the perception of the same sun? Even if the cognition be with form, it can be regarded as apprehending an object only if it has a form that is not different from the object that is cognised
It may be that what is perceived by the downward rays is the sun shining above presented mediately; but even so, the perceiver regards the sun shining above as actually down in the water.—If the sun were actually perceived just as it stands, then it would be cognised as such, not otherwise. this has been already explained
Similarly it is not true that (in the case of the man looking at the mirror)—“it is through illusion that the man cognises the face as facing the west, though in reality what he actually perceives is the face as presented by the visual rays proceeding eastward to the rays as proceeding westward.” As a matter of fact, the perception of the reflected image cannot have the man’s own real face as its objective basis; because what figures in the perception is something entirely different from the real face; just as in the case of the perceptions of taste and sound, etc
In a smaller mirror the face appears as smaller;—the tree reflected in the water appears as upside down, and as sunk in the water; the object reflected in the mirror faces the mirror,—not so its reflected image;—while the reflected image is in the water, the object reflected is far off;—the reflected image always varies with the reflecting surface, as regards its largeness, smallness, etc.,—not so the object reflected.—For these reasons our reason cannot be regarded as ‘inadmissible’
If, even when what appears in the cognition is something quite different from the object, it be regarded as the cognition of that object,—then all cognitions of colour, sound and other things, would envisage all things
2591) When the eye is slightly pressed by the finger, if a single object is perceived as diverse,—that also is pure illusion, entirely baseless
2592) The reality of the appearance of the reflected image has already been discarded before; because two corporeal material objects cannot exist together, because they are mutually obstructive
Even if the reflected image exists in several places, it varies regarding its largeness, smallness and so forth; hence it cannot be one and the same
The idea that appears in men as to ‘the sun being over my head’ is surely wrong; because all living beings see the same sun at the same time,—and not different suns; because in reality no second solar disc exists; if it existed, it would surely be seen, and yet it is not seen; hence it is definitely concluded that only one sun exists.—As regards the word-sound, however, it has never been definitely ascertained to be one and the same; because whether appearing in succession or simultaneously it is clearly characterised by multiplicity. Even when speakers pronounce the letter ‘ga’ at one and the same time, the difference among them is clearly apprehended
When the letter is pronounced in succession, one after the other, the diversity is not only directly perceived, but also inferred through the inferential indicative in the shape of the fact of the cognitions appearing in succession
It may be that the apprehension of the word-sound is dependent upon the manifesting articulations; but even so it could be apprehended only as it really exists; otherwise, the apprehension would not be of that sound at all; as its form would not figure in that apprehension. As a matter of fact, the word-sound is never apprehended as pervading over the whole ākāśa. Why then does the word-sound follow the diversity of place of the articulation? When manifested, it would appear by itself, like the jar and other things. All this about the cause has been said only by way of an elaboration of our argument. In reality the inefficiency of the manifesters has already been proved on the basis of the impossibility of manifestation.—As regards the directly perceptional notion that ‘this is the same word-sound’,—that has been already discarded; and it stands unrefuted that appearing in diverse places, the word-sound must be diverse
When a man passes from place to place, one after the other,—it is so because he is in a perpetual flux; if it were not so, there could be no such ‘going’; if he remained fixed, permanently, then the man, not dissociated from his previous position, would continue to remain there; and as such he could not get at another place
kāśa being undefinable and vague, there can be no ‘manifestation’ of it; and as it is beyond the reach of the senses, what is seen in the pit, is not ākāśa, but light
Further, as in the case of the word-sound, so in the case of ākāśa also, there can be no ‘manifestation’; such ‘manifestation’ would mean cognition; and this would be everlasting, as its cause would be always there.—Just as, in the case of the word, there can be no manifester,—so it cannot be in the present case also; and in reality, it is an illusion appearing, through extraneous circumstances, in regard to the cognition of the word-sound. Hence the conclusion is that length, shortness and the rest are not properties of the articulation. They could be so only if the articulations were the manifesters of the word-sound; and this idea has been rejected
It has been frequently explained before that words and things that are entirely different from one another are capable of providing the same ideas. Hence it is not true that the word becomes expressive only when its relationship to its denotation has been apprehended. because, as already explained before, in reality, the word, by itself, is not expressive at all
As a matter of fact, all cognitions produced by words are expressive of what is unreal; because of the fact that there can be no denotation of the ‘universal’ or of the ‘specific individuality’ and such things; but even though in reality, there is diversity, people, through illusion, come to treat and speak of the word—‘cow’ for instance,—as one only,—regarding all as the same.—This much of what has been said by the great brāhmaṇa (mīmāṃsaka) on the basis of the diversity of words is entirely baseless
For instance, the shaking of the hand and such gestures are not regarded as one and the same (and yet they indicate affirmation and denial). The cognitions of the word-sound that are produced have the varying characteristics of length, shortness, etc.—[which also shows that the word is not one];—the idea that the one word is variously ‘manifested’ has been discarded. There is no ‘commonalty’ (common character) perceptible in the several appearances of the word; and it is only through convention that they become aids to the cognition of denial, affirmation and the rest
It has been already explained that words do not bring about the cognition of things directly,—because there is no invariable concomitance between words and external things; all that the words do is to indicate the presence (in the speaker) of the desire to speak (of things)
Words are definitely known—through perception and non-apprehension—as the effect of the desire to speak; hence between them the relationship is clearly that of cause and effect
It is only when the man has definitely recognised the said causal relationship through convention that he comprehends, from words, the desire to speak; as in the case of the gestures of the hand
It is only when the convention is there that there comes about the causal relationship of the word with the object varying with the speaker’s intentions. It is on this account that it has been declared to be ‘due to convention’; and inasmuch as it is manifested by convention, the said relationship comes to be spoken of as ‘convention’ itself,—but not directly, (only figuratively)
The relation of cause and effect is not anything different from the things that are the cause and the effect; it is these things themselves that are spoken of as such
Each of the two is apprehended by dull-witted men as one and the same; thus it is that it is held to continue during all the time from the convention to the usage
It is not possible for the relationship to be real and one. because the things denoted being distinct and diverse, there would be no relationship at all
As regards the assertion that—“the convention being made for each mortal being, or for each utterance, etc. etc.”—has been made without knowledge of the view of the other party. As a matter of fact, the convention as constituting the relationship does not belong to the two factors (word and its meaning),—it belongs to the man; the only relationship between the two is that one serves to manifest (indicate) the other; and this relationship also is not direct.—Nor do the other party hold the convention to pertain to each utterance;—nor (according to them) is the convention made by god, or any other being, at the beginning of creation; as the idea of such beings has been already rejected
The relationship with each being must be different, because of ‘perpetual flux’; as for the idea of ‘similarity’, that is not incompatible with difference
The cognitions of things clearly appear in succession; hence they declare that (relationship) also to be successive otherwise there would be no succession
As the understanding is come to by many persons at one and the same time, the convention is not held to be different (with each individual); just as in the case of the one blue-point. It is not that one connection or relationship is present in the mind of the speaker, and an entirely different one in that of the hearer; because it is of one and the same form and is present, as such, in the minds of both. When the speaker proceeds to lay down a connection for the benefit of the hearer, he lays down only that connection which has been known to himself from before. Thus, inasmuch as its recognition always appears in the same form,—even when the word, etc. are different, he comes to cognise the oneness (of the connection)
As regards the jar and other things also, the ‘universal’ has been already discarded.—The ‘configuration’ (‘universal’) is not held to be a quality of material substances.—Nor is the capacity of the jar, to contain water for instance, known from its ‘universal’,—if the jar, etc. are non-different from the ‘universal’, then, like it, they also should be eternal. If then, they are different from the ‘universal’, then it becomes open to objections relating to the relation between the two.—If the relationship were something produced, then the universal would be non-eternal.—Hence the capacity (of the jar) to contain the water cannot be due to the ‘universal’,—even if the jar etc. were different,—there would surely be all these objections regarding the ‘capacity’; and the effects of this ‘capacity’, in the shape of the containing of water, etc. would thus have to be regarded as eternal
If it is held that—“the connection (or relationship) is only a kind of potency, and there can be no diversity in potency”,—then the potency of the word and its meaning would be one and the same, as there would be no distinction.—Even if there were some distinction, there could be no connection between the potency and those two.—If it were something produced, then it could not be eternal; and there is no other possibility for anything
At the time of the assertion of the connection, when the word ‘cow’ is uttered, some people, who are cognisant of the connection, comprehend its meaning,—while others do not;—and the reason for this lies in the presence of the connection in the form and manner in which it has been made known.—Under your view of the ‘connection’, however, all men should comprehend the meaning; because according to you, the connection consists of potency only, and potency is eternal; so that it should be able to bring about the cognition of the meaning at all times; or, otherwise, it should not be free from limitations.—If being eternal, it were free from limitations,—why should not all men comprehend the meaning of the word?—If, on the other hand, it has limitations,—what would be the reason for such limitation, when it is in the nature of the potency itself? A man who has no knowledge of the convention (bearing on the word), or when he has forgotten it,—does the cognition of the meaning appear in the same one man? Because the potency restricted to the production of that cognition is there all the time,—the idea is that the eternal potency is effective only when it is itself known,—so that, if the known potency be different from the unknown one,—then it loses its eternality;—while if it is the same, why is this distinction set forth? 
Further, by what means does the potency become known?a) “It is by means of presumption;—the process being as follows:—The man perceives the word-sound, the experienced man (pronouncing the word) and the thing spoken of—through sense-perception;—the fact of the hearer having comprehended the meaning is cognised through inference from his activity; and the dual potency is cognised through the fact of the phenomenon not being capable of any other explanation;—thus it is by presumption that they recognise the relationship vouched for by the three means of cognition”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepaparihāra, 140-141]
The potency cannot be cognised in the manner suggested; because the phenomenon is quite explicable otherwise; for instance, there is no difficulty in the comprehension of the meaning of the word from the word itself as aided by convention
Under the view that the potency is eternal, there can be no need for anything in the shape of convention and the rest; and the comprehension of the meaning of the word would be there at all times.—If a word had the potency of expressing other meanings also,—as in the case of the words ‘kali’ and ‘mārya’—it could not bring about the cognition of those other meanings; as the potency of the word is restricted.—Is the potency held to be indicative of the several meanings, one or diverse 1 if it is one, then at one and the same time, there should be comprehension of the several meanings of the one word all at once
As the potency indicative of the meaning remains there at all times, the comprehension of the meaning brought about by it would also be there at all times and for all men.—If, for that, it is assumed that the potency is dependent upon convention, then it would be dependent upon a helper; and being helped, it could not be permanent, eternal
Inasmuch as the convention that serves to indicate the meaning is dependent upon man,—there would be possibility of ‘falsity’ (mistake) in the potency, even though born otherwise
A single word may have the potency to express several meanings. Even so, such things as the ‘agnihotra’ and the like, cannot all be of use to all men; because it is possible that they may express things contrary to what is desired by a certain person. Hence your assumption of an eternal relationship between the word and its meaning is entirely futile
When there is need for the convention, why are you seeking to bolster up, without reason, the ‘relationship’ in the shape of the eternal potency?—In the matter of expressing the meaning, there is not found, apart from convention, any operation of such a full-fledged entity as the ‘relationship’
Any functioning (of the relationship) has never been perceived, in the absence of convention.—If it be asserted that the relationship proceeds from the convention,—then disastrous indeed would such a regress be
All usage becomes explicable on the basis of mere convention proceeding from the whims of men; hence there is no reason for postulating the relationship
It is merely suspected that there can be no other explanation for usage; but that does not bring about the proper cognition of the connection (or relationship) which is beyond the senses.—As all men would be ignorant, there could be no ‘long-continued tradition’ which could establish the connection in question. How then can such an assumption be made? 
For these reasons, all such words as ‘cow’, ‘horse’ and so forth cannot have any eternal relationships,—because they are dependent upon convention,—like such words as ‘gāvī’ and the like
The capable (expressive) word ‘go’ being there, if the idea of the cow arises from the use of the corrupt form ‘gāvī’,—it is due to its resembling the original (correct) word;—such use being due to the incapacity (of the speaker).” This cannot be right. How can any such cognition of the right meaning appear on account of the resemblance to the original correct word, among fishermen, etc., who are ignorant of the Sanskrit language?—For these reasons it cannot be admitted that there is an eternal relationship between words and meanings. It can only be based upon convention; as that is possible in all cases
If there be dissolution in the form of the destruction of particular countries or the destruction of particular families,—or in the form of that undeniable destruction postulated by the Buddhist,—which is suspected of affecting Brahmā, etc. also,—such destruction would be possible for the Veda also. Hence any subsequent ideas that might appear (as based upon the Veda) would be one whose basis has been destroyed, and it might be assumed that they may all be false and wrong, arising from delusion, stupefaction, and such other sources; and hence the Veda now available would be only a mere semblance of the original.—All these notions might go on arising until reasons are not available to the contrary
As a matter of fact, if there were a desire to alter the text of the Veda, the words could not remain the same,—so also if there were no such desire in the minds of men,—then and not otherwise, could there be an impossibility of regarding the Veda and its meaning being other than the one usually accepted.—Even if this desire is not there, the suspicion does not altogether disappear
The order of sequence, is not accepted by all men as fixed for all; in pact, people adopt the order of words and sentences and letters according to their own wish. If that were not so, then, for you, like the Veda, there would be no book written by men; so that the composing of all meaningless (or wicked) works is rendered impossible at one stroke! Because there could be no certainty that this man is uttering words exactly as they had been used previously by others,—therefore like the relationship, they also could not be regarded as beginningless
The idea that ‘I am using the words that have been used by other persons’ would proceed from illusion, due to the recognition of similarity; just as there is in the case of acts
As a matter of fact, the words uttered by a man are not exactly those used by others; as there are always differences of accent and other details.—These latter are not properties belonging to the manifesting agency; because they are always perceived in the form of letters. Consequently the letters pronounced by each man must be regarded as distinct,—like the jar and such things. This difference being quite clear, why are you denying the signs of that difference? 
The idea that ‘in the case of the jar, etc. their use is characterised and indicated by the “universal”’ has already been discarded; because the universal does not exist, and because it can have no connection with the individual thing
All such universale, therefore, as ‘palate’ and the rest vary in all men; consequently when the speaker utters word-sounds, he does not do so through those universals
2683) Thus there are no distinct universals of these articulations. Which could serve to bring about the manifestation of the word-sounds; nor are there as many of these as there are letters
Nor, as asserted by you, could the order of sequence among the articulations be due to the order among the conjunctions and disjunctions of the palate, etc.; nor could the eternality of both be due to their respective universals
2685) Just as in the actions of moving about, etc. there is no order of sequence through the universals,—so too there is none among the palate, etc., the articulation and the letter
The cognition of the properties of the universal cannot be due to the subtle nature of the individuals; not can there be, through this, the cognition of order among the letters, even though these are all-pervading
Consequently, the letters, following the properties of the articulations, which appear as eternal, cannot become expressive of diverse meanings
There is another point: granting that ‘there are universals which serve to manifest the sounds, and there are as many of these as there are letters’;—under this view, as the manifester would be always there, the sound should be heard at all times. Consequently, the order of sequence among the letter-sounds cannot be in accordance with the order of the manifestations
If the universals continue to exist as related to the individuals, the eternality of the individuals also is irresistible. or (conversely), if the individuals exist as related to the universals, then the universals also should be noneternal, even if you do not relish it
The fact that there can be no connection with manifestation having been already established, the letters thus could never be expressive
Time, as something one, all-pervading and eternal, has already been rejected; nor is it manifested in all things, like the letters, by anything; and if it is manifested in the letters, it cannot form a factor in the expression of the meaning of words;—as it is not different from other things,—and as it does not exist elsewhere, it cannot be eternal.—Thus then, the order of the letters,—as also their shortness, length, etc.—are all adjuncts of the articulation, and are not so many phases of time.—Thus for you, there is no property in words which is eternal; hence it becomes established that the word is not-eternal,—for those who regard the letter as non-eternal.—Nor could it form part of the property of anything else,—like tee fleetness of the horse,—if it were assumed that the manifesting cognitions bring about the manifestation of the words
The presumption put forward in support of the eternality of all things has been already discarded. It has also been proved that the comprehension of the meanings of words is possible only when words are not eternal.—When one letter-sound is produced by the ‘desire to utter,’ following from the desire to utter another letter-sound,—the former is heard immediately after the latter;—the cognition proceeding from the cognition of the preceding letter is not heard very quickly; in fact, with the aid of the remembrances of the previous letters, the latter brings about its own remembrance later on. Thus it has the character of an effect, in relation to the cognitions leading up to, and apprehending, it.—Or, the order of the letters may be dependent upon men. From all this it follows that the letters clearly vary with each word; as is found in the case of such words as ‘dama’-‘mada’, ‘latā’-‘tāla’ etc., where the letters are the same but their order different in the two words. It is under this order of sequence that these words become expressive of different meanings.—Consequently, the assumption of the ‘sphoṭa’ also is absolutely futile in this connection
The ‘sphoṭa’ has been assumed by the grammarians for the purpose of explaining the cognition of the meanings of words.—But the letters themselves being competent to express the meaning of words, the assuming of the said sphoṭa is futile. As it would be perceptible (if it existed), but is not perceived, it is concluded that it does not exist.—If it is imperceptible, then it cannot be indicative, like the inferential indicative (which is effective only when perceived)
Be it be urged that—“the cognition follows from its mere existence; and as its causal character is there, it is held to be able to bring about the cognition like the visual organ”;—then, the answer is that, in that case, the said cognition would be there at all times;—even when there is no knowledge of the convention, and there is no hearing of the letters,—there would be cognition proceeding from the sphoṭa, as its efficient cause would be there always; as this entity (sphoṭa) is eternal. (According to the grammarian), and it has no need for anything else. Nor can there be ‘manifestation’ of it by articulation or convention or letters; as it is never perceived; it is cognition itself that is spoken of as ‘manifestation’ and there is no cognition of it. Hence it follows that the assumption of the ‘manifester’ of the sphoṭa is also futile
What happens is that the articulation plants the seed in consciousness, and it becomes developed by the last articulation,—and therefore the word appears in the consciousness”.—This assumption also is made without reason. Because even so, the word is not perceived to appear as anything different (from the letters)
Whether the sphoṭa is produced or manifested by the articulations which appear in succession,—such succession is incompatible with the view of those who uphold the sphoṭa. When the sphoṭa is indivisible (without parts), there can be neither manifestation nor production of it in succession. As they would never lie outside the one and the same form,—they would be there for all
Even if the sphoṭa is with parts (divisible), as the letters expressing them would do so only in succession, why should not the sphoṭa-parts also be likewise? Why should unseen ones be assumed? 
Even when the producing and the manifesting (of the entire sphoṭa) have been done once by one articulation, people pronounce the other letters for the purpose of a clearer manifestation; because it is difficult to determine it as manifested once;—therefore it is manifested again and again by means of letters with similar appearances.” 
When, sir, that same, or something else, is repeated again and again,—is it not the manifestation of it that is repeated,—there being no difference? 
The ‘manifestation’,—as in the case of letters,—can only consist in the embellishment of the object or the sense-organ concerned. And here also, in regard to the cognition envisaging the sphoṭa, the said ‘manifestation’ can be denied in the same way (as in the case of letters)
From all this it follows that it is the word that is apprehended on the wake of the previous successive cognitions of all the component letters,—which is the cause of the comprehension of the meaning
What happens is that—when the final letter in the word has been cognised, the impressions left by the cognition of all the letters brings about the remembrance of all the letters simultaneously
All parties agree that there is such subjective (cumulative) cognition in connection with all things,—even when they are cognised in a certain order of sequence
In case this is not admitted, then, in connection with things seen one after the other, there could be no such cumulative cognition as there is in the idea of ‘a hundred’ and other numbers
Thus then, though, in regard to the letters, the cognitions, auditory and mental, that appear at first are in an order of sequence,—yet, later on, there is remembrance of them all, at the same time
Thus the letters do enter into it; as the things denoted are not far removed from them; this is the reason why people speak of the cognition as proceeding from the word
All this is quite compatible with the view that cognitions have forms; otherwise, as they would be destroyed, how could they figure in the remembrance? 
If it is argued that—“the previously cognised letters have only their appearance concealed, but when remembered, they are there all right”,—then, the answer is that—it cannot be so; as, if it were so, then there would be a clear idea of them
Such continuance, however, has been already rejected; if there were such continuance, then the remembrance should appear at the time of the cognition of the apprehension of the letters; because the two would have one and the same cause
We are not objecting to the single cognition in the form of ‘gauḥ’, the cow; but the notion of oneness regarding the word is due to the facts that it is apprehended by a single idea and (2) that it denotes a single thing
The unitary conception may be possible in the case of the word ‘go’ on account of the rapidity (of its utterance) and of the smallness of the interval; but in the case of such words as ‘Devadatta’, the difference is clearly perceived
The cognition of the meaning must be regarded as arising from the letters; because it appears after the cognition of these; what is like it arises from that,—like the cognition of fire arising from smoke
As a matter of fact, the cognition of the meaning is not found to follow after a cognition envisaging a verbal entity apart from the letters; hence no other word can be expressive (of that meaning)
In all cases, positive and negative concomitances are definitely known to be the ground for regarding one thing as the effect of another; and it is thus that the invariable concomitance is recognised in the case in question
It having been established that expressiveness belongs to noneternal letters,—the ‘recognition’ and ‘inference put forward in proof of eternality, become annulled
The objection in question has been urged by the other party, through ignorance that his doing so involves self-contradictions on his part; because there are all these (self-contradictions), if you hold to the view of the eternality (of letters and words).—It has been already explained that if words are eternal, they cannot be expressive; because they could not have any connection with the order of sequence (among the component letters) and so forth; also because they are not perceived at all times
The ‘inadmissibility of the reason in respect of its substratum’ which has been sought to be proved by the putting forward of a number of likely alternatives regarding the nature of the ‘subject’ (word),—is all due to ignorance of the real character of inference; because the ‘subject’ is always that which actually appears (in consciousness). What actually appears in consciousness is well-known, without cogitation;—even ordinary fishermen know that that alone can form the ‘subject’.—And yet, it is on this very point that dispute has arisen among babblers. There can be no dispute regarding a thing where diversity is created only through one’s whim
2737-2739) When the ‘subject’ has been spoken of without qualifications, the setting up of alternatives regarding qualifications would put a stop to all inferential processes.—Even with regard to the (mīmāṃsaka’s) inference that—“the idea derived from the Vedic injunction must be right, because it is brought about by causes free from defect”,—several such alternatives could be urged against him, as—‘if the subject is meant to be the cognition brought about by injunctions that are eternal and related to eternal denotations, then the probans is one whose substratum is not admitted by the other party.’ 
Eternality’ consists in continuing in the same condition; and the opposite of this is ‘non-eternality’. in the continuing in the same condition ceases, what is left there that could be held to be ‘extant’? 
Letters, devoid of order of sequence, cannot be expressive; hence such letters cannot constitute the ‘sentence Nor can the letters have an order of sequence. as they are all-pervading and eternal, there cannot be any sequence in them of either time or place,—like what there is in the letters reduced to writing, or in the case of fruits and flowers.—If the order of sequence were inherent in the letters themselves, then they would always be in the form ‘sa-ra’, never in the form ‘rasa’; as the latter would be incompatible with the former order, which is eternal. The letter ‘ra’ that might be elsewhere cannot be said to appear in any other order of sequence, from out of air. Because every one of the letters has been declared to be one and eternal. If it were not so, then ‘recognition’ put forward by you as a reason for eternality’ and ‘oneness’ would be inconclusive; as it would be present even when the letters are diverse
The order of sequence in the ‘manifestation’ cannot constitute the sentence, because it has been shown that there can be no ‘manifestation’ of what is eternal.—For this reason the eternality of the sentence cannot be due to its being related to the universal ‘sentence 
Just as the technical words like ‘vṛddhi’ have their meanings created by the whim of man,—so may also be regarded to be the case with words like ‘svarga’, ‘yāga’ and so forth.—In the case of such works of men as stories, dramas and novels, the connection between words and meanings is never meant to be real and eternal
In the case of the works cited also, the potency is eternal; the non-eternality attaches only to the particular use of the word; and it is on account of this latter fact that there arise doubts regarding the eternal potency.” 
In reality, the thing spoken of in these works has no real existence outside; wherein then could the meaning be attributed?—If it be said that—“the meaning is attributed to the reflected conceptual content”,—then, the same may be said regarding the Veda also
Who can ever cognise the potency, in the form of the connection between the word and its meaning? That is why in the case of the Veda, even the use is not regarded as due to human agency.—It could not be learnt from more experienced people; because, by themselves, these also are equally ignorant. the only cognition therefore that may be possible is through the explanations provided by men
This objection is equally applicable to the scriptures composed (by persons).”a) Not so; because to these (scriptures) people have recourse through faith and confidence, even in regard to things that are open to doubt
2774b) 
We have confidence in the scripture]—The assertions whereof are found to be confirmed by perception and inference.—That cannot be the case with the Veda; as this has been held to be self-sufficient in its authority
What the other party has urged in this connection is most irrelevant and has been said without perceiving that the said character of original stories and dramas, etc. is equally present in the Veda also
Barring the eternality of the word and its meaning, there could be no other reason for accepting the eternality of their relationship. Therefore in regard to the veda, there can be no beginning for the said relationship.—The inference of the origination of the said relationship is negatived by the absence of means (causes); and as for the inference of the non-assertibility of pre-established relationship, it is set aside by direct sense-perception.”—[Ślokavārtika-sambandhākṣepa-parihāra, 136-138]
2777-2778) commentary. 
The only means (of comprehending the meaning) consists in the perceiving of its repeated comprehension by experienced people. and certainly the failure of such means cannot be admitted, in regard to the bringing about of the comprehension”.—[Ślokavārtika-sambandha-kṣepaparihāra, 138-139]
All this would be true, only if there were certainty in regard to the meaning of the Veda; only in that case could the notions obtained from experienced men be true (in consonance with it); otherwise the whole fabric will fall to the ground
As a matter of fact, there can be no ‘counter-argument’ against the reason ‘because it is an aggregate’; because this is a character whose invariable concomitance has been recognised as embracing all things
When letters are expressive, with distinct meanings, and appear in a particular order of sequence,—they come to be known as ‘word’, ‘sentence’ and such groups; it is these that have been so spoken of as ‘aggregates—and it has been shown that all this—expressiveness, distinct meanings and order of sequence—is impossible in the case of words not emanating from personalities.—Hence the invariable concomitance (premiss, put forward by the buddhist) remains unshaken
There is no such certainty of invariable concomitance in regard to ‘the character of being spoken of as vedic study’; hence such a reason is open to the charge of its negative concomitance being doubtful
If it were known for certain that men are unable to bring about the said order of letters, etc.—Then alone would there be the invariable concomitance desired by the other party. That, however, can never be known for certain; such a certainty could be obtained only if the capacity and property of all men were perceptible; and this could be possible only for a person who is omniscient
It is clearly conceivable that the Veda is the work of man; as it speaks of wrongful sexual acts, killing of animals and telling of lies.—As for the character of being difficult to pronounce, the agreeableness of sound, difficulty of comprehension, disagreeableness to the ear and so forth,—these characteristics of the Veda are found in the works of decriers of the Veda also.—as regards such properties as capacity to cure poison, etc. that are found to be true,—this is found also in the case of incantations laid down by vainateya and such persons
Cannot in this way an inference be made regarding the work of human beings—such as those of the Sugata (Buddha)? 
Because its form was revealed by him, therefore the words are called ‘of the Buddha’. the remembrance of the author that is there may also be regarded as merely commendatory.—It might be said that—“This is not so accepted by the other party”;—but if the reason is equally applicable, why cannot it be accepted?—or, it may not be accepted by the other party; even so, it may be regarded as possible, in accordance with reason
At all times, men are mostly prone to telling lies; just as there is no confidence in regard to things present, so also there is none regarding the description of past events’ (Ślokavārtika-sūtra 1. 1. 2; 144).—by this reason of your own, there can be no person recognised as the author of any work at all; even though he may be declaring it to be his own work.—Thus then, please abandon all hope in the truthfulness of the word which does not proceed from a personality; specially as in such words have been mentioned many things contrary to what has been said in the Veda
Then again, in this way what would be proved would be only beginninglessness, not freedom from personal authorship. under the circumstances, if the Veda were regarded as not the work of any person, then the same may be said in regard to other revelations also
The customs of the Pārasīkas and others may be based upon others; and the doctrine of the Atheists also may have its source in the ideas of other people
Even if such freedom from authorship were proved,—what good would that do to you? As the whole attempt of yours has been towards the establishing of truthfulness
As regards the probans—‘being time’ and ‘being person’,—the negative concomitance of these is doubtful; because, as shown before, it has not been proved that man is incapable of doing the work in question.—the idea of ‘manifestation’ also has been rejected. hence the speaker himself should be regarded as the ‘author’ (maker). thus then, in both the arguments, the instance is devoid of the pro-bandums
Because it is dependent upon the teaching of men, and because it has been proved to be the product of effort,—therefore ‘freedom from the speaker’ does not reside in the ‘subject’, nor in the corroborative instance
The eternality of the sentence having been rejected, the character of ‘proceeding from the eternal sentence’ is clearly recognised as non-existent in the ‘subject’ and in the corroborative instance.—Thus, then the fact of the Vedic injunction not being the work of a person being uncertain, your subsequent reasons also are open to the charge of being doubtful—hence—inadmissible
When the ‘perpetual flux’ has been established, the veda, as something eternal by itself, becomes clearly discarded.—How then can there be any cognition produced by it?—It has certainly been declared in the veda often enough that ‘it does not perish’ in regard to the Puruṣa (spirit, soul); but the rejection of this has been clearly set forth above; hence the reason is clearly ‘inadmissible’.—If a man is capable of directly perceiving time, space and other souls like the jujube-fruit in the palm of his hands,—he alone can have a cognition for whom there could be no rejection (of the said ideas)
The Veda thus is something of which the exact form or subject-matter is not known to men,—and hence it is like dense darkness, for which only dull-witted persons can have an attachment;—like the attachment of the Pārasīkas to their customs. Hence, like the Pārasīkas, those dull-witted persons also, ignorant of its meaning, have recourse to such sinful acts as the killing of animals and the like,—under the influence of the fruition of their past wicked deeds
Thus, it has not been proved that the Vedic injunctions are the valid means of right knowledge of dharma; for the simple reason that its meaning cannot be ascertained by any one, either by himself or with the help of other dull-witted. persons
For these reasons, please seek for a person whose inner darkness has been dispelled by the light of knowledge, and who is capable of teaching the clear meaning of the Veda
For these reasons, please seek for a person whose inner darkness has been dispelled by the light of knowledge, and who is capable of teaching the clear meaning of the Veda
Thus then, it being established that the Vedas are the work of a personality, the self-sufficiency of their authority and validity also becomes overthrown without effort
Thus then, it being established that the Vedas are the work of a personality, the self-sufficiency of their authority and validity also becomes overthrown without effort
Just as in the case of the initial cognition, so in that of the other also, there would be infinite regress, as before; and seeking for them one after the other, we could not secure a resting ground.—In case the cognition of the perfection is not held to be one that has its validity dependent upon the presence of those perfections in its cause,—then the initial cognition of the object also should not need the valid cognition of perfection in its cause.—Thus then, even going along to a long distance, if one has to admit, at some stage or the other, the self-validity of the cognition,—it is far better to admit it at the very first step.” 
On what grounds have the corroborative cognition and the cognition of perfection been held to be superior to the initial cognition,—on the strength of which the latter should be dependent upon those two?—From all this it follows that validity must be regarded as inherent in all cognitions, as a general rule; and it is discarded only when there is either an annulment of it or the cognition of its source being defective. Even though this way the discarding of the validity will be dependent upon extraneous causes, there would be no infinite regress. Because after all, it would be dependent upon validity, and this is there, inherent in the cognition.” 
Just as validity is not proved by validity cognition,—so invalidity also is not proved by invalidity. In the case of one thing being dependent upon another thing of its own kind, there can be no resting ground; in the case of dependence upon something of another kind, its root is firmly established, because it is due to another cause.” 
The sublating cognition is always in the form of the cognition of the thing concerned as different from what is envisaged in the previous cognition; and as in this form, it is not dependent for its validity upon anything else, it sets aside that previous cognition.” 
It may be that there too there may be need for another sublating cognition in certain cases, where suspicion might be aroused in the mind of the person by the previous cognition; but that suspicion ceases after very little effort.” 
If another sublating cognition of it is further sought for, then the middle (second) cognition would become sublated; which would establish the validity of the first cognition.—If even after due effort at seeking for it, no other sublating cognition is found,—on account of there being no basis for it,—then no cognition sublative of the first sublative cognition would be found; and thus there being no sublation of this, this becomes strong and hence sublates the initial cognition; hence it is the validity of this latter that becomes discarded. Thus then, the investigator need not proceed beyond three cognitions; and when the man has not had any further sublating cognition produced, he need not suspect the presence of such cognition.” 
If the man, through stupidity, should imagine the existence of the sublating cognition, even when none has come about,—he would be beset with doubts in all his dealings and would be landed in utter ruin.” 
Vāsudeva himself has deprecated such a suspicious nature; in the words—‘neither this world, nor the next,—o son of Kunti,—is for the man of suspicious nature’.” 
When in regard to a cognition, a certain sublation is possible,—and on being sought for, is not found,—then in regard to that cognition [it has to be concluded that its sublater does not exist]; and in regard to such a thing, investigators desiring their own welfare should not take their stand upon imagining that such sublation might appear at some time.” 
Place, time, man and circumstances,—diversities of these are met with in actual experience; hence when one is seeking for sublation, he should seek for them in these.” 
If there is a wrong perception due to the thing concerned being at a distant place, there would, in some cases, be a suspicion of its really being something else; and the limit of this possibility would extend only till the man has approached near the thing; and in such a case, there is no expectation of any sublation regarding time, man and circumstances; as for example, in the case of the cognition of the mirage, etc.” 
Similarly when at a time of dense darkness, there are doubts regarding the animal seen being a cow or a horse, followed by the ascertainment of the truth,—the limit of all this consists in the appearance of light.” 
Similarly, in regard to the moon, the misconception of the directions, and the letters and accents of the Veda, and such things,—that the truth is otherwise is ascertained by enquiries from other persons.” 
When persons having their perceptive organs deranged by love, hate, intoxication, madness, hunger, thirst and the like, come to cognise things that are cognisable with difficulty,—the contrary conclusion is ascertained after the cessation of the said derangement.” 
In transactions relating to debt and other heads, when there is a dispute between two disputants, there is one statement by the dependant and two by the plaintiff; and it is for avoiding an infinite regress that no further statements are recorded;—and it is on the basis of the said three statements alone that the master (judge), the witnesses and the assessors should come to a decision.—Thus, in all cases, there is a following up of three cognitions only; and it is for this same reason that the deities are called ‘trisatya’ (three-truth).—Thus then, if the validity of cognitions is inherent in them, there is no infinite regress; and the validity and invalidity remain as they happen to be in reality.” 
That word which is definitely known to be eternal, or uttered by a trustworthy person, is never vitiated by the hearer or the speaker;—because teachers and fellow-students help to prevent mutilations thereof and are fully competent to preserve such assertions.—Consequently, the assertion does not become vitiated by the defects which are warded off by the excellences (of the teacher, etc.).—Or, when there is no pronouncer or ‘maker’ of the word or assertion, there can be no defects, as there would be no substratum for these.” 
In the case of the words of the trustworthy person, two facts have been perceived: (1) that there are no defects, and (2) that there are excellences;—that validity is not due to the excellences has already been explained before;—and on account of these excellences in the speaker, there can be no defects in him, these being discarded by the excellences. tThus the validity belongs to the word itself,—and is indicated by the absence of the defects.” 
If the absence of defects in the words of the trustworthy person is deduced from his excellences, then there is the same infinite regress,—for one who would follow up this presence of excellences
This does not affect us. The cognition of the excellences is not needed at the time. it is not as cognised that the excellences are operative in the matter; by their sheer presence they are competent to set aside the defects; and while they are there, there does not appear any cognition of the defects of the man.” 
Because the defects are not cognised, therefore they do not set aside the validity; not being set aside, it becomes established by itself here also.” 
In the case of words emanating from personalities, there is always room for doubt whether there are defects or not. In the case of the veda, however, there being no author, there can be absolutely no suspicion for us regarding the presence of defects.—Consequently, just as validity (and reliability) is accepted in the case of the Veda, on the ground of its being independent and self-sufficient,—so the same validity becomes established in regard to the words of a trustworthy person also.” 
The fact that other means of cognition never have any bearing upon what is said in the Veda establishes its validity.—otherwise, it would be merely reiterative.” 
Such corroboration (by other means of cognition) does not form the basis of the validity of other cognitions also; because among cognitions envisaging the same thing, there can be only option,—which means that validity can belong to only one of them.” 
Even in a case where the thing is definitely apprehended by the later cognitions,—the thing has not been clearly and definitely apprehended by the first cognition.” 
No validity could belong to the cognition of a thing that is destroyed immediately on being born,—or to auditory perception,—because these would not be corroborated by the eye and other means of cognition
If it be urged that—‘the validity of the auditory cognition would be due to its connection with another auditory cognition’,—then of the Veda also, the validity may be due to the corroboration of another cognition brought about by the Veda. In both oases, the (corroborative) cognition is not produced by other means; hence they do not need corroboration by cognitions produced by other causes.” 
Just as, in the case of the validity of sense-perception, there is the definite basis in the form of corroboration by another cognition produced by the same sense-organ,—the same should be asserted to be the basis in the case of the Veda also.” 
When the cognition brought about by any one sentence is found to be the same at all times and places, and in all men,—then no other basis need be sought for its validity. Thus then, when a firm conviction produced by a sentence is not found to be incompatible with the cognitions appearing at other times and places and in other men,—it is undoubtedly valid.” 
As a matter of fact, the validity of verbal and other cognitions is not to be proved by means of inference. otherwise the validity of sense-perception also might have to be proved by inference (which is absurd).” 
If the validity of cognitions were proved by another cognition, then, of this latter also, the validity would be proved by another, and so on and on, there would be infinite regress.—If the validity of the cognition that proves the validity of another cognition be not proved by any other cognition,—then the same might be the case with those whose validity is held to be proved by others.” 
As a matter of fact, sense-perception, etc. are not quite recognised as ‘pramāṇa’, ‘valid’; and until they are so recognised, no business would be possible
Before the cognition is apprehended, it remains there in its own form; and so far as its own objective is concerned, it is independent and self-sufficient and after its own objective has been cognised, the cognition itself comes to be cognised by other cognitions.” 
Just as objects are apprehended by the eye and other sense-organs, which latter are themselves uncognised,—so, in the same manner are things apprehended by cognitions also, without these latter being themselves cognised. Hence becoming cognised is not of much use in the validity of the cognition. For the same reason the apprehension of things also is obtained from the cognition that is itself uncognised.” 
Like valid cognition, invalid cognition also operates upon its object, by itself (independently); but the fact of its being false cannot be apprehended without another means of cognition.” 
The false character of the thing is not apprehended by the former (i.e. the invalid cognition) in the way in which the true character (is apprehended by the valid cognition). Thus then, it is only when there appears the cognition of the truth being otherwise,—or the cognition that the source of the cognition has been defective,—that the falsity (invalidity) of the cognition becomes recognised; not on any other grounds. At the time that it appears it is always recognised as valid.” 
For these reasons, even in cases where the falsity is explained to others,—these two ideas have to be pointed out,—and not mere similarity.” 
The ignorant men who, on the basis of mere similarity to invalid cognitions, seek to prove the invalidity of all cognitions,—for them such an argument is conducive to their own ruin. Because for the other party also, there comes about an argument which is the reflection of the Buddhist argument; and thus being refuted by this, the argument (of the Buddhist) turns out to be the means of proving what is not true; and as such, it is not capable of setting aside the Vedic injunction which is inherently valid.” 
The answer to the above is as follows:—as a matter of fact, the distinction that has been made has some basis only in regard to those things that are held to continue to exist after being produced
It is only for the securing of their existence that things like the jar stand in need of a cause; when once they have secured their existence, they become operative by themselves towards their own effects
2921) That cognition which you also regard as not lasting after being born, becomes non-existent after having secured its existence; what sort of activity or operation, then, could it have? 
The operation of causes has always been found to be something different from the birth of the effects; in order to preclude this from the case of cognition (pramāṇa), the term ‘birth’ (‘janma’) has been introduced [by Jaimini in his sūtra 1.1.4]—the idea being that the cognition does not continue to exist for even a single moment, and yet it is not born as invalid; on account of which it could operate only later on towards the apprehending of the object,—in the manner of the sense-organs.—[Ślokavārtika—sense-perception, 54-55]
If the cognition is held to be not-momentary and even eternal, then this goes against what has been accepted elsewhere, and it is also nullified by reasoning
a) It has been demonstrated in detail that all things are in ‘perpetual flux’;b) As for the eternal thing, it is never produced; what need then could it have of a cause? 
For these reasons, it can be asserted that by itself the cognition cannot be valid, the validity comes only later in relation to its effects,—because it is featureless,—like the ‘sky-lotus 
Inasmuch as certainty regarding its validity would be obtained from the cognition itself, there can be no room for doubt or wrong cognition, etc
Inasmuch as conviction and wrong cognition are mutually destructive—if wrong cognition becomes excluded, conviction remains entirely unaffected
Thus then, for establishing the validity of the cognition arising from the Veda,—any such assertion as that it arises from causes free from defects and so forth, is of no use
If it is held that—“the self-sufficiency of the validity of cognitions having been accepted as a fact, the arguments that have been set forth are only for the purpose of refuting the denial of the same”,—even that cannot be right; as there can be no possibility of such denial; there can be a suspicion of such denial, only so long as the firm conviction regarding the validity has not appeared;—as soon as that conviction has appeared, whence could there be any suspicion regarding invalidity,—for the removing of which your attempt could be useful? when a man has been convinced that the tall thing standing before him is a post, he no longer suspects it to be anything else
When a firm conviction has appeared in a certain form in connection with a certain thing, from a certain cause,—all suspicions to the contrary are removed by that same conviction
When the existence of fire has become cognised through indicatives like smoke,—the idea of the non-existence of fire becomes discarded by that same cognition
Thus then, please accept the fact that the denial of invalidity is obtained by itself; hence for the denial of invalidity, no arguments are needed
2937) If there were any suspicion of the two kinds of ‘invalidity’,—then there would be no certainty regarding ‘validity’; since the thing in question would have formed the object of wrong cognition
When a thing has become the object of doubt or misconception, there can be no certainty regarding the real form of that thing as in the case of the post
For example, (1) the post, (2) the fire, and (3) invalidity are cognised extraneously by means of the notions of (1) the crow, (2) smoke and (3) defects in the source of the cognition
Because validity has been definitely pound to be subject to doubt and misconception,—therefore please understand that any certainty regarding it can be obtained only extraneously
Your view is that—“it is only in the sentence in which the negative word is found that there is denial of something else, and in all other sentences, it is the positive denotation itself that is apprehended”;—now in your assertion (under text 2348) that “the cognition produced by the Veda is valid”—the negative word has not been used; hence it cannot mean the denial of invalidity
Further, if the validity of all cognitions is duly recognised as being inherent in them by themselves,—then why is there a difference of opinion among disputants? 
That there is diversity of opinion is shown by the fact that] one party consisting of the ‘prācyas’ (easterners or ancients) assert definitely that “the validity of cognitions is always inherent, self-sufficient, in themselves”; while others assert that in some cases, the validity is self-sufficient, while in others it is due to extraneous causes;—and there is no hard and fast rule one way or the other
Dispute always arises from misconception,—and such misconception is rendered impossible by the certainty of conviction; hence when the various parties would have ascertained the truth (regarding the self-validity of cognitions), they would never quarrel among themselves
If there were a firm conviction regarding the self-validity of all cognitions,—then, by virtue of this same conviction, no one could hold a different opinion.—when a man accepts the invalid as valid, he becomes deceived. when, however, there is conviction regarding self-validity, no one can be opposed to it
One who acts in pursuance of an invalid cognition meets with non-conformity with reality; and certainty regarding invalidity has been held to be due to extraneous causes and ascertainable by a subsequent sublating cognition. On the other hand, one who acts in pursuance of a valid cognition does not meet with the said non-conformity; and it is in regard to this that we hold that there is firm conviction regarding its validity being inherent and self-sufficient.” 
What has been said is not right; as it proceeds from ignorance of what is meant by us. What is meant by us in regard to the subject of conviction regarding the self-validity of all cognitions is as follows:—In a case where the conviction regarding self-validity is not certain, what is cognised, by elimination is invalidity; because irrespectively of the fact of the real state of things being otherwise than that envisaged in the cognition,—and the fact of the source of the cognition being defective,—the conviction regarding its invalidity appears immediately after its birth.—Consequently, the invalid cognition cannot be said to be a case of the ‘reversal of validity’; hence no one would ever act in pursuance of the cognition that is not in conformity with reality; because there is always a certainty regarding its non-conformity
In the case of the jar, there is no time for action, apart from the time of its birth,—because it has a momentary existence; hence the corroborative instance is ‘inadmissible 
Subsequently to their birth, the jar, etc. do not depend upon the potter and other such causes; but they do depend upon their own constituent causes and other things; so that of the jar itself, there can be no action
If validity is dependent (upon something else), there can be no infinite regress. Hence there can be certainty regarding self-validity only when there is cognition of effective action
2957) “What peculiar feature is there in the second cognition, different from those of the previous cognition, on account of which it is not regarded to be entirely like the previous cognition?” The answer to the above is as follows:—it is conformity with the real state of things that is called ‘validity’; and there is no feature of it except the repeated cognition of effective action.—The cognition envisaging effective action is clearly apprehended; and the apprehension becomes confirmed by the after-thought envisaging the same. Thus its own real validity haying been duly ascertained, it does not stand in need of any subsequent cognition of the same effective action. Thus the validity of the cognition becomes manifested in the very first cognition envisaging the said effective action; and thereby its validity becomes confirmed
If the initial cognition did not envisage a real entity, then the second cognition, in the form of confirmation by conformity to the real state of the thing, would not appear at all; as its cause would not be there. For example, when a man has the cognition of fire in reference to the cluster of aśoka-blossoms, there does not appear the cognition envisaging burning and cooking (which are not brought about by what has been cognised as fire). If this latter does appear, then the cognised object turns out to be not anything different from fire; because fire is only an entity that is characterised by the capacity for producing its effect (in the shape of burning, cooking and the rest)
From all this it follows that so long as the cognition envisaging effective action does not appear,—there is always a suspicion of the initial cognition being wrong (invalid); because of the causes of misapprehension
2966) In regard to the first cognition, there are various grounds for suspecting it to be wrong,—such as (1) the non-perception of its effect (in the shape of effective action), (2) perception of similarity, (3) inefficiency of the cognition and so forth. When, however, there appears the cognition envisaging its effect, there are no such grounds; because there is direct perception of action, which is directly related to the entity cognised
In the case of the initial cognition also, even though its effect may not have been seen, if the cognition has been repeated, a distinct peculiarity is perceived in it which differentiates it from cognitions not pertaining to the thing concerned, [and this establishes its validity]
If no difference is perceived,—then, on account of the suspicion of the thing being otherwise than cognised, there can be no certainty regarding validity, unless there is a cognition envisaging the resultant effect. In such a case even though the validity may be present there, it cannot be ascertained; it is recognised only through the subsequent cognition of its resultant activity. It is for this reason that the first cognition needs its corroboration; and for the same reason it is not necessary to seek for the corroboration of the corroborative cognition also
Of the second cognition, the validity is self-sufficient, because there are no causes for misapprehension; in the case of the first cognition, however, there is hostility towards its self-validity, on account of the possibility of misapprehension
If the validity of the cognition is not definitely ascertained,—then how could any sane person have recourse to activity? Because what is wanted is not cognised.” 
Our answer to the above is as follows:—it is through the doubtful cognition itself that the clever man has recourse to activity; and this does not detract from his cleverness
It is because of the man having acted on the basis of a doubt, in regard to the ascertainment of validity,—that its being the proper means can be ascertained; so that there is this even when there is doubt
When I have recourse to activity on the basis of a doubtful cognition,—if i succeed in obtaining the fruit of that activity, then certainty regarding the validity of that cognition would be automatically apprehended; it cannot be ascertained in any other way.—Nor can it be reasonable to raise the question as to ‘how the man has recourse to the said means for the simple reason that there is no other way available. As a matter of fact, without the means, no one can get at the end.—Thus, even when acting on the basis of a doubtful cognition, the man does not lose his character of being a sane person
As a matter of fact, cognition envisaging effective action is present in dreams also; and yet, on that account, it is not valid;—nor is its source, the former cognition, valid.” 
It cannot be so; because the whole of that state is illusory? having no basis in the external world;—hence in those states, there can be no conformity with external objects;—all these are known in their own forms, not differing, in this, from the mind and the mental states. This is the reason why the difference between the two states is clearly perceived
The following might be urged:—“it being ascertained that its validity is due to extraneous causes, the cognition should be regarded as ‘cognised’”.—There is no in congruity in this
The validity of the cognition is always asserted in reference to the thing apprehended by it; and this validity being apprehended by another cognition, the former cognition does become ‘cognised’;—and there is no incongruity in this, as the notions of ‘cognition and cognised’ are based upon relativity,—as in the case of ‘cause and effect’ and the like
Thus, it is established that the idea of validity, being ascertained through the cognition of effective action, does not involve infinite regress; as all further need has ceased
Even when the cognition has come about, its validity is not ascertained until the perfection of its source has been apprehended by another cognition [so that there is an infinite regress].”—The answer of the wise ones to this is that there can be no infinite regress; because the said perfection of the source is apprehended by the cognition of conformity, which is not dependent upon anything else; as the conformity of the result is perceived when the object is near by; and from that follows the cognition of the perfection of the sources (of the cognition) without any effort. In the case where the object is not in close proximity, the cognition arising from it must be valid, because it has been brought about by it (the perfect cause),—just like the cognition apprehending the object which is in close proximity (to the observer), 
In regard to the conch-shell before our eyes, when it is found that the effective action resulting from its cognition is one that can be produced by the white object, it is understood that the cognition of the white conch-shell is not one produced by eyes affected by jaundice. The purity (perfection) of the cause having become thus recognised, if, at the same time, there should arise the cognition of the yellow colour in connection with the conch-shell made of gold,—as that also would have been brought about by flawless causes, there would be certainty regarding the validity of that cognition,—just as in that of the cognition of the white colour in connection with the white conch-shell, which has led to effective action
The author of the Bhāṣya also has said the same thing by the mention of the attack of hunger, etc.; hence it is through sheer delusion that the infinite regress has been urged
The validity of the initial cognition is not recognised, because of the suspicion that it might have been brought about by defective causes. this is the point in which the ‘cognition of perfection’ has been regarded as superior
Thus the perfection of the cause being ascertained through the cognition of effective action,—in a case where there is no effective action at all, the functioning cannot be deprecated
If self-validity of cognitions is the general rule, and it is discarded when there is either an annulment of it or the cognition of its sources being defective,—then validity becomes really due to the absence of annulment and absence of the cognition of the source being defective; and for you thus the certainty regarding validity is due to extraneous causes. Because the said ‘absence’ is a negative cognition, which is essentially different from the other form of positive cognition,—this other form being ‘non-apprehension’ according to you, and ‘inference’ according to us
By this same reasoning (that you have put forward) the invalidity also of cognitions may be proved to be inherent in them; as the same may be asserted in support of it as follows—‘therefore self-invalidity of cognitions is the general rule, and it is discarded when there is either absence of annulment, or absence of the cognition of its source being defective.’ 
Similarly, the invalidity of cognition must be taken as following from its being of the nature of apprehension, and is discarded by the cognition of its being in conformity with the real nature of things and by the cognition of efficiency of its source.—If ‘invalidity’ were due to extraneous causes, there would be infinite regress; because it could be dependent upon the valid cognition, and this is itself unstable
For instance, you assert ‘validity’ on the ground of the absence of sublating cognition; and ‘absence of sublation’ also is held to be a distinct form of cognition, named ‘non-apprehension’;—so that the validity of this latter also is asserted on the ground of the absence of sublating cognition; and this process proceeding on and on, there can be no resting ground (stability)
3004-3005) Because the fact of the validity of the sublating cognition being self-sufficient has not been proved, therefore it cannot set aside the preceding cognition
If validity is admitted in some cases, even when there is no absence of the sublating cognition,—then why should there be hostility against the initial cognition? 
If the sublating cognition sets aside the preceding cognition, because its validity is self-sufficient,—why should there arise any suspicion regarding it? What could be suspected would be the possibility of another sublating cognition with self-sufficient validity; but such a suspicion would be self-contradictory, and could never arise in regard to what has been duly ascertained
Under the theory of the self-validity of cognitions, the validity being ascertained by itself, why should an effort be made to prove the existence of a sublating cognition?—Because, when the validity of a cognition is not definitely cognised by itself, its sublating cognition is got at without effort. Thus, why should there be said to be ‘three cognitions’ for the investigator? In fact there is not room for a single one; the conviction regarding it having come about by itself.—If it be held that—“even when no sublating cognition is actually found, there arises suspicion due to doubt; because the non-apprehension of sublating cognition is not always concomitant with its absence”;—then, under the circumstances, why have you become satisfied with only three (cognitions)? Because, as before, even when the sublating cognition is not there, its presence could always be suspected; and this suspicion of sublation could not cease until one met with conformity to effective action; hence the restriction to three only is entirely futile.—Thus then, even in a case where no sublation has actually appeared, its presence can always be suspected; specially as casuistry can never lead to the ascertainment of truth.—Even though a man may have had the unsublated cognition of the conch-shell as yellow, throughout his life,—such cognition can never become valid
It is just possible that the sublating cognition does not appear because the cause of the removal of the defect is not available, or because of some other reason; hence the suspicion regarding the possibility of its being there does not cease
Thus, even where the suspicion (of sublation) is due to stupidity, there is always some ground for it; when there is cognition of the perfectness of the cause and that of conformity to reality, there arises no suspicion in the mind of the wise. so that he does not become beset with doubt in all his dealings: as his mind has become free from doubt, on the cognition of the said perfectness and conformity.—If even after this, a foolish, man entertains suspicions,—it is in reference to such a person that the suspicious character seems to have been deprecated by the unborn one (in the bhagavadgītā)
If the ascertainment of validity is dependent upon the exigencies of place, time, the man and the circumstances,—it is clear that the definite cognition of validity is dependent upon extraneous causes. for instance, the place and time having been ascertained through the absence of sublation, the ascertainment of the validity of the initial cognition clearly follows from other means of cognition
As regards dealings regarding debt, etc. which admit of only three statements,—this condition (of three statements) is applicable to those cases only, and should not be cited in connection with validity.—In those cases, the two disputants make statements on recalling things to their memory, and do not find time to make a careful scrutiny of things. As regards the validity of cognitions however, things have got to be determined in regard to the real state of things,—and not by mere casuistry. Hence the dealings that have been cited are not analogous to the subject under consideration
The fact of the deities being called ‘trisatya’ cannot lead to any certainty (regarding validity); in fact, if this certainty does not follow from the very first (statement), it cannot follow from others
Inasmuch as the later two statements are of the same two men,—if there is no confidence in the first one, what peculiarity is there in the other two (which makes them more trustworthy)? 
Thus, in accordance with the reasoning set forth previously, there is infinite regress involved under your view also. and validity and invalidity remain as they are in reality
The eternal word has been discarded by us previously in detail. Under your view, there is no trustworthy person entirely free from all defects; and how can a person be ‘trustworthy’, when the mass of his ignorance has not been dispelled? because on the presence of the defects, it is always open to suspicion that his word may be false
Even though such a ‘trustworthy person’ may be born,—who could come to know of the host of his good qualities, and thereby have confidence in the words of such a trustworthy person?—If there were some one with supernormal vision who could perceive his excellent qualities,——what use could such a person have for any ‘words of the trustworthy person’? Because he would himself know all things, independently of all assertions. as for any other person, as he could not recognise the ‘trustworthy person’, he could never learn of things from his words
Under the theory of ‘self-validity’, the certainty comes about from the birth of the cognition itself; hence there can be no ‘mutilation’; what then is there to be prevented? 
It is true that the assertion is not vitiated by the defects, which are warded off by the excellences; but as there can be no certainty regarding the excellences, there can be no certainty regarding the said fact (of not being vitiated)
The idea that the ‘eternal word’ is without a ‘maker’ has been already refuted; consequently it cannot be right that “there being no maker, there could be no defects, for which there would be no receptacle.” 
How validity can be due to excellences has been already explained; and so long as the excellences are not recognised, the absence of defects cannot be perceived.—Thus then, it cannot be right that the assertion, valid by itself, is indicated by the absence of defects; because, not being cognised, the absence of defects cannot serve as an indicator
Unless people know the sticks they cannot have any idea of the stick-holder. Thus the idea of the ‘self-validity’ being indicated by the absence of defects becomes discarded by self-contradiction.—The absence of defects can qualify the ‘word’ only when ascertained by that means of cognition which consists of nonapprehension; and in this way validity of a cognition would be due to something extraneous to itself.— 
Even when the excellences are there, the cognition of the defects of the man do appear. if there is non-cognition of excellences, how can there be any cognition of the absence of defects? 
Defects,—in the shape of hate, delusion and the like—are set aside by excellences,—in the shape of kindness, wisdom and so forth; consequently, if there is no certainty regarding these latter—kindness, etc.—How can there be any cognition of the absence of those (defects)? 
At the time (of the cognition of the absence of defects), the excellences do not function on being themselves cognised; in fact, it is by mere presence that they help in the cognising of the absence, of defects”.—[Ślokavārtika 1.1.2; 67]
If it were so, then, there would be no (a) doubt, nor (b) wrong cognition (misconception),—in the case of the person recognised as ‘trustworthy’—in the shape of (a) ‘are there defects in this person or not?’, and (b) ‘there are defects in him’. And yet there are such doubt and wrong cognition in some men; until it is recognised that he is the receptacle of excellences
If there were certainty regarding the self-validity (of cognitions) even when there is no cognition of the absence of defects,—then, in regard to the speaker, there could not be the ‘contrary cognition’ spoken of above (under 3045)
When there is no cognition of the absence of defects, how could there be any cognition of the absence of the two kinds of invalid cognition,—from which the certainty regarding validity could be deduced?—And if, even when there is no cognition of the absence of the two kinds of invalid cognition, the self-validity (of the cognition) were cognised,—then, as before, there would be no doubt or misconception at all
3048-3049) [The contrary cognition being in the form]a) ‘is his assertion true or untrue?’ (Doubt),—or (b) ‘it is absolutely untrue’ (misconception); [these would be ‘contrary’] because there is the certainty that all cognitions are valid by themselves
For the above reasons, it is absolutely necessary that there should be definite cognition of all the three factors absence of defects, (2) absence of invalid cognitions and (3) presence of excellences
In regard to all these, there would be the two possibilities—is the cognition of these valid or invalid? how then what is itself invalid be a factor in the ascertainment of validity? 
If the said cognition is valid, then] its certainty regarding its validity could be possible only if validity were extraneous.—How again is it ascertained that the said cognition (of the three factors) is valid?—If it be said that—“it is deduced from the absence of cognitions to the contrary”,—then the question arises—is this deduction itself valid or not?—Thus all the objections urged above come back in full force
The validity of the cognition in question could be possible only if validity were extraneous;—how too can the invalid cognition bring about a right cognition in keeping with the reality of things? It is to be considered how the validity of this also becomes apprehended;—it may be deduced from the absence of cognitions to the contrary and so forth;—all this comes about which cannot be desirable (for the other party)
Thus then,—“from excellences follows the absence of defects; from this absence, there follows the absence of the two forms of invalid cognition; hence the general law remains undenied” if the validity in all cases is determined on this principle, then in the case in question also,—all the aforesaid objections become applicable; and it also involves an infinite regress
The assertion that “there is validity when there is absence of defects” contains a negation; if this negation is meant to be absolute; then it can never be proved.—It cannot be proved by apprehension, because it is of the nature of negation;—nor can it be proved by non-apprehension, as that would involve an infinite regress
If the absence of defects and that of the two kinds of invalid cognition are proved by non-apprehension,—and this absence of apprehension is proved by another non-apprehension,—then there is infinite regress
If the absence is of the nature of relative negation,—then its cognition would only be the negation of something other than itself; so that the cognition of the absence of defects would be of the nature of the cognition of excellences; and it would thus come to be of the nature of the cognition of the intended valid cognition. The cognition of the absence of the two kinds of invalid cognition also would turn out to be of the contrary nature. Or, in case the absence of the two kinds of invalid cognition were cognised independently by itself,—how could you secure the conviction that the rest of it is valid?—If it be urged that “the conviction is due to the pact that well-known pacts could not be explicable otherwise”,—then this 
From that same reasoning of yours it might follow that the invalidity is inherent in cognitions; as the same arguments apply clearly to, and can be asserted in regard to, that view also;—hence it is the absence of excellence that follows from the defects; and from that absence follows the absence of validity; hence the general law stands undenied.—Inasmuch as this general law is the creation of mere whim, it can be asserted quite clearly in regard to invalidity, just as well as in regard to validity.—Because it is in the nature of apprehension that cognition is regarded as invalid,—and it is discarded only by the knowledge that it is right, in accordance with the reality of things, and by the cognition of the excellence of its sources;—and the invalidity is not set aside by the excellences, as these have not been cognised; hence being not-denied, the invalidity remains established as being inherent in the cognition
In the case of words emanating from personalities, there is always room for doubt whether there are defects or not; and as it has been proved that there must be an author of the Veda, it is not true that we can have no suspicion regarding the presence of defects in it
Thus, what has been asserted regarding the validity of the Veda being self-sufficient, cannot be admitted,—because as a matter of fact, that also is dependent upon the author
In case there is no corroborative cognition, nor perfection in its source,—the appearance of doubt, and consequent invalidity, is inevitable, in the veda
In the case of the validity of other cognitions also, such corroboration is always regarded as the ground (for validity); hence certainty must be based upon that corroboration
It is only when the validity is there that certainty regarding it is brought about by this (confirmation), and this does not produce a fresh validity in it
In the case of the thing that is destroyed immediately on being born, validity does belong to the cognition; in fact, it is there, even in a case where there is no certainty regarding it,—the certainty appearing in the manner described
When there is cognition of the excellence of the cause and other conditions, then there follows certainty;—and also when effective action is found directly, in the share of burning, etc.;—or repeated functioning brings about the result independently.—When there is absence of all these means (of certainty), then there is no certainty at all. Thus even if validity were there, it would be uncertain,—as good as non-existent; that is why it is said that it is not present
It is not true that there can be no corroboration of auditory cognition by the eye and other means of cognition. Because colour, sound and the rest are dependent upon the same circumstances. In fact all these are mutually concomitant and, as occurring in the same ‘chain’, they are the cause of each other. Thus it is clear that there is relationship among them. Through these then there is connection among their cognitions also; just as between ‘smoke’ and ‘the effect of wet fuel’. Thus auditory cognition would be quite valid,—on account of being corroborated by other cognitions
This cognition produced by other means is quite certain; that is why the corroboration by cognitions produced by other means is desired
Thus, in the case of the validity of sense-perception, there is the definite basis in the form of corroboration by other cognitions produced by several sense-organs; but such is not found to be the case with the veda
The first cognition of water that appears is produced by the eye; then there follows the later cognitions relating to drinking and bathing, as dependent upon the gestatory organ and the body (respectively)
As a matter of fact, the cognition brought about by any one sentence is never found to be the same at all times and places, and in all men; as in all cases there arises doubt. It is true that the same words—“heaven is attained by the performance of agnihotra and other rites”—are heard by all men; but it is devoid of all elements of certainty,—resembling the mere croaking of frogs
Even among Brāhmaṇas there is difference of opinion in regard to ‘heaven’ and such things; hence the cognition derived from the Veda is not found to be the same in all men
As regards the firmness of the conviction produced by the Vedic injunction,—that has been already rejected; because as a matter of fact, the said firmness is always doubtful; as the matter apprehended by the said cognition is similar to others
How have the Brāhmaṇas, who are certainly not omniscient, been able to ascertain that “the cognition produced by the Vedic injunction is the same at all places and times”? As a matter of fact, it has been already explained that the validity of perception also is ascertained by means of inference. for instance, a certain perception is valid, because it is produced by flawless causes, like other perceptions
The validity of all cognitions is not proved by other means of cognition; as it has been proved that there is no misconception involved in the case where there is cognition of effective action
When the inference is brought about by the indicative (probans) in the shape of its nature and its effect,—the indicative whereof the ‘infallibility’ has been ascertained,—there can be no mistake in it
In some cases, the mistake or illusion that arises from the various causes of illusion is set aside by another cognition; because there is no certainty in such a case
There can be no ‘manifested thing’ until its manifestation has become manifested; hence it must be admitted that the cognition itself is actually cognised,—just like the sense-perception in other persons
Being themselves ‘insentient’ the eye and other sense-organs do not apprehend things; they only serve as the cause of cognition of those things
Thus then, the fact of being cognised is of great use in the matter of the validity of cognitions; because there can be no apprehension of things which is not itself cognised
Even in the cognition of itself by itself, there is this fact that there can be no certainty regarding its validity, on account of the possibility of causes of misconception being present, consequently it is not ascertained that what is cognised is a real entity; because mere apprehension can also be due to similarity, and there is always the possibility of the imposition (misconception) of something else
Just as repeated cognition is regarded as valid by itself,—so also in some cases wrong cognition is invalid by itself
It has been already explained that the idea of falsity of the cognition being ‘due to the presence of sublating cognitions and to the cognition of its source being defective’ involves infinite regress. Hence the falsity (invalidity) cannot be recognised merely on the basis of the said cognitions
It cannot be recognised that it is valid at the time that it appears;—because it is non-conceptual and because self-cognition is not admitted.—Nor can it be recognised by another cognition; because it is not there at the time; also because its presence is not manifested; or because of an undesirable contingency
In connection with the Veda, it has been already pointed out that there is a sublating cognition in the form of inference; hence by the rejection of the ‘soul’ and other things mentioned in the Veda, it becomes established that the cognition derived from the veda cannot be valid.—As it has been proved that the Veda is the work of a personal author, the fact of its having a defective source is always open to suspicion.—If the capacity in question (i.e. validity) were inherent in cognitions, just as the capacity to burn is inherent in fire,—then such validity should belong to wrong cognitions also.—Thus it is open to suspicion that the cognition provided by the Veda proceeds from a defective source, and what is suspected to be defective does not differ from what is actually perceived to be defective
For these reasons ‘self-sufficient validity’ is not possible in the Veda also; consequently please accept the view that the Veda has been composed and expounded by persons who are definitely recognised as free from defects
As there go on appearing on the scene expounders of the veda who are beset with love, hatred, etc.,—people become more and more careful in the preserving of the Vedic text. to this end, they go on investigating all such minute details asa) Which scholar has a weak memory?b) Who was the earlier scholar?c) Who would commit mistakes regarding accents?d) Who would be breaking up words in the wrong places?—When there are so many enthusiastic scrutinisers busy with the guarding of the various points of danger, why cannot the serious reader study the Veda free from flaws?—If Vedic scholars, though themselves pure and honest, were indifferent towards the purity of the Veda, they might be unable to notice the Vedic text mutilated;—and in this way in course of time, the Veda, disregarded and mutilated, would become something quite different, a mere semblance of the Veda.—Under the circumstances, if the Veda is constantly and carefully guarded by persons who keep a check upon persons beset with love and hate bent upon mutilating the Veda,—then the Veda will never lose its real form (3108-3113) 
What we hold is that the world has never been unlike what it is now; and no universal dissolution can ever be perceived in reality.” It cannot be as asserted. because it may be possible that the actual verbal text has remained the same; but that the same has been the case with the comprehension of its meaning cannot be admitted unless it is actually seen
That the verbal text has remained the same can be ascertained only by a person to whom all men, and all times and places are visible like the fruit in the hand; if it were not so, then, why should there have been a difference of opinion due to the divergence of time, place, persons and circumstances? 
You have no proof for the notion that the world has always been as it is now. The existence of the ‘saṃvarta’ (dissolution) also cannot be denied simply because it is not seen
Under the view that the validity of cognitions is inherent in them, certainty of conviction must be regarded as brought about by the Veda by itself, in regard to its own form (text); hence there can be no possibility of delusion in respect to that.—Thus, there being no room for ignorance, or doubt, or misconception,—even the infant of the Brāhmaṇa should not require any teaching.—Just as there is no possibility of the destruction of the thing whose root (cause) is unknown,—how could there be any destruction (mutilation) of what is eternal and superior even to the diamond (in its indestructibility)?—If it be said that “there may be destruction in the shape of perversion of the manifestation”,—then the answer is that the possibility of such manifestation of what is eternal has been already rejected.—Hence if wise people seek to preserve the vedic text, the attempt is entirely superfluous
For these reasons please accept the view that there has been an author of the Veda,—one who is capable of seeing things beyond the senses, who has shaken off the entire mass of darkness and ignorance, and who is conversant with the meaning of the Veda and its divisions
For these reasons please accept the view that there has been an author of the Veda,—one who is capable of seeing things beyond the senses, who has shaken off the entire mass of darkness and ignorance, and who is conversant with the meaning of the Veda and its divisions
All that is pertinent to the present context is the denial of the knowledge of dharma (by man); who is denying the possibility of a person knowing other things?” 
If the thing related to the context is some such thing as oil, water or clarified butter,—and if a person knowing all about such a thing is called ‘all-knowing’,—then he may be so; we do not deny that.” 
If the thing related to the context is some such thing as oil, water or clarified butter,—and if a person knowing all about such a thing is called ‘all-knowing’,—then he may be so; we do not deny that.” 
When certain people have come to the conclusion that such and so many are all the things that exist,—all those who know this and those who have learnt the works written by them should be ‘all-knowing’.” 
For instance, one who has knowledge of the six ‘objects of cognition’, through the six ‘means of cognition’, would be ‘knowing all’ in an epitomised form; who is there who would not admit such an omniscient person?” 
If one assumes the existence of a person capable of directly perceiving all things in detail,—such assumption is absolutely futile and false.” 
Even in a single body, there are so many atoms, and so many hairs, etc.;—who can know all these?” 
If an attempt were made to prove that one has the knowledge of the details of all individuals and components of the whole world,—it would be as futile as the investigation of the crow’s teeth.” 
Just as the assertion that ‘one knows all things with his eyes’ is futile, so also would be the proposition that ‘there is a person capable of directly perceiving all things’.” 
By proving the existence of the person knowing only dharma and adharma, whom the Buddhist postulates,—one secures the reliability and acceptability of the scripture composed by him; and by denying the said person, one secures the unreliability and rejectability of the said scripture.—Thus when people proceed to prove the existence of the person knowing all the little details of the entire world, they put themselves to the unnecessary trouble of writing treatises on the subject and carrying on 'discussions on the same.” 
If the person has the direct perception of all things, then he should have direct knowledge of such tastes, etc. also as are unclean;—who could assume the existence of such a person?” “As a matter of fact, the words of the Buddha and others are not found to provide any knowledge of what is contained in the Vedas, the Upavedas and the subsidiary sciences and their auxiliaries; how then can such a person be regarded as ‘omniscient’, without reason?” 
When there are many omniscient persons, preaching mutually contradictory doctrines,—the grounds of reliability being the same in all,—which one of these should be accepted as reliable?” 
If Buddha is omniscient, then what is the proof for Kapila not being so.—if both are omniscient, then how is it that there is difference of opinion between them?” 
In the matter of one matter, of arithmetic for instance.—all beings—Jina, Buddha and others,—are found to be truthful; and no distinction is found among them.” 
That same reason, by which the omniscience of one person is proved, merely on account of your love for your own view of things,—is found to be present in other persons also;—the objections also that the Buddhists, with great zeal, urge against the arguments in proof of the omniscience of Jina, are also urged by the Jainas (against the other party).—Under the circumstances, how can any definite conclusion be arrived at through such reasonings and counter-reasonings, which are uncertain and swallowed by their own reflections?” 
In this way pseudo-omniscient persons haying been beaten off by each other, the few that remain shall be beaten off by the upholder of the Veda.” “Any herb that has been touched by the teeth of the mongoose removes the poison of all serpents, even when applied in play (carelessly); in the same way any stray secular and spiritual argument proceeding from the mouth of the Vedic scholar will destroy the poison of all serpent-like Buddhists and others.” “Who can (reasonably) assume (accept) the existence of a person (omniscient) who can be rejected by such reasons as—‘being knowable’, ‘being cognisable’, ‘being an entity’, ‘being existent’ and so forth? The man who assumes the existence of an omniscient person knowing all things through a single means of cognition may certainly apprehend all such things as taste, odour, etc. through the eyes alone.” 
As a matter of fact, the perception of certain things through certain causes in the past was exactly as it is found to appear at the present time.” 
Those persons who have been found to be superior to others are so only on account of intelligence, memory and strength,—which vary slightly with varying persons,—and not on account of the capacity to perceive super-sensuous things.—Even the intelligent man who is capable of perceiving subtle things is superior to other persons, without going beyond the limitations of his own kind.” 
As a matter of fact, in the matter of the auditory perception of sounds, superiority among men is found in the apprehending of distant and subtle sounds,—not in the apprehending of colour and other things. Similarly in the matter of visual perception, what is brought about by the attainment of superiority is the perception of remote and subtle colour,—not the perception of sound and other things.” 
Similarly great superiority is often found in men, in the matter of scientific discussions; but that alone does not prove that the man is an expert in all sciences.” “When one has learnt grammar, his intelligence goes very ear in the matter of correct and incorrect forms of words; but not in the matter of the determination of stars, dates, eclipses and such subjects.—Similarly, the astronomer, though superior in the matter of the knowledge of the moon, the sun, eclipses and so forth, is incapable of determining the correctness of such words as ‘bhavati’ and the like.—Again a man, very superior in his knowledge of the Veda, history and such subjects, is unable to visualise such matters as creation, deity, and apūrva”
The man, who can jump into the sky to the height of 15 feet, can never jump to the height of eight miles,—however much he may practise jumping.” 
Thus then, even when the superiority of knowledge proceeds very far, it can comprehend only a little more than others,—it can never comprehend things beyond the senses.” 
While the man is seated in a hut, the sense-perception that he has has its range restricted within that hut, it does not extend into another hut. Those things again which are separated from one another by intervening lands, hills and oceans, countries, continents and islands,—who can perceive all these when seated in one place?” 
When nala and ṛtuparṇa,—who were experts in matters relating to horses and to gambling, respectively—were going together in the chariot, ṛtuparṇa made the following statement—‘all men do not know all things,—no one can be omniscient,—there is no end to knowledge, resting in any one man’.” 
Sense-perception has never been found to possess the capacity to apprehend future things; and as for inference and other forms of cognition, these can never come about without the indicative and other factors.” 
Thus then, there can be no one who perceives things beyond the reach of the senses; he alone knows such things who knows them through the eternal word.” 
The assertion is true because it has been made by the omniscient person, and such an omniscient person exists because he asserts it. How can both these notions be established without some other well-known basis?” 
When people admit of the omniscient person on the basis of the baseless assertions of persons who are not omniscient, why cannot they derive the same knowledge from their own words?” 
For the proving of the existence of one omniscient person, it would be necessary to assume several omniscient persons; and if a single one of these happen to be not-omniscient, he would not be able to recognise the omniscient person.” 
As a matter of fact, even the contemporaries of the omniscient person could not know him as ‘omniscient’, as they would be devoid of the knowledge of the cognitions of that person [or, of the knowledge of the things cognised by that person].—[see Ślokavārtika 1.1.2, 134], and if the omniscient person is not recognised by any one,—for that man, the assertion of that omniscient person could not be reliable; as the very basis of that assertion would be unknown,—as in the case of the assertion of other ordinary men.”—[see Ślokavārtika 1.1.2, 136.] commentary. 
Even if a person were to comprehend the things known to all his disciples, he would not be ‘omniscient’; as he would be devoid of the comprehension of the things known to people other than those disciples.—Nor is it possible to comprehend all the things cognised by all men; as there can be no coming together of men of the past, present and future, inhabiting all the three regions of the world.” 
A man who knows little can delude a few men, to the extent that, having their mind deluded by devotion, they come to accept him as omniscient. Through the art of chiromancy, some people are able to know what has been eaten, what is being thought of, what lies within a man’s fist and so forth,—though they are entirely devoid of any knowledge of dharma and cognate matters. Similarly, people expert in the arts of illusion, magic, etc. deceive an ignorant man;—by which they appear to be omniscient.” 
The description that we meet with in itihāsas and purāṇas of Brahmā being omniscient and of his knowledge and dispassion as untrammelled,—all this should be understood in the figurative sense,—like the commendatory declarations relating to mantras.—Or, the ‘untrammelled knowledge’ that is spoken may be taken as referring to the knowledge of dharma and other matters relating to the particular context;—what is meant is that his knowledge of such things as ‘ditty’, ‘property’, ‘pleasure’ and ‘liberation’, is ‘untrammelled’; it cannot refer to all things.” 
Being untrammelled does hot mean that it envisages all things; it may be called ‘untrammelled’ when it is so only in relation to its own particular object.” “That is so because it is only the cognition of dharma, etc. that is fruitful; no useful purpose is served by the cognition of such ordinary things as the tree and the like.—Thus then, inasmuch as this whole fruitful cognition is not obstructed, it is called ‘untrammelled’.” 
Or, the knowledge spoken of may be that of his own ‘self’—brought about by the practice of meditation; as such knowledge would never be obstructed, it is spoken of as ‘untrammelled’.” 
When Śaṅkara is spoken of as equipped with ‘ten imperishable qualities’ in the shape of knowledge, dispassion, supreme power and so forth,—he also is ‘possessed of knowledge’ only in the sense of knowing his own self.” 
His knowledge consists only in the direct perception of his pure self; when the source of that knowledge is not pure, the knowledge itself is called ‘ignorance’.” 
It may be that Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara are embodiments of the Veda, and as the Veda consists in the knowledge of all things, these are omniscient; but how could that apply to man? Where, on one side are the mortal men, Buddha and the rest,—and where on the other, are the said three superior deities? Hence the idea that the former, in rivalry to the latter, are also omniscient,—is sheer delusion”
There is mention of the three deities, Brahmā, etc., in the Veda, which is eternal; and yet the eternality of the Vedas does not become impaired; because Brahmā and the rest are themselves eternal.” 
They are equipped with eternal qualities and eternal functions; hence there is no incongruity in these being mentioned in the eternal Veda.—On the other hand, Buddha, etc. are perishable beings, hence it is not possible for them to be mentioned in the eternal scripture. And when the scripture is held to be eternal, the assuming of the omniscient person is entirely futile.” 
Rather than admit the idea of the scripture indicating the omniscient person, it is far better to accept the idea that it indicates dharma. Because the clear knowledge of dharma (directly from the Veda) is superior to the unclear knowledge derived indirectly through the knowledge of the omniscient person mentioned in the Veda.—Thus it cannot be maintained that the omniscient person is spoken of in the scriptures.” 
If any person similar to the omniscient person were seen at the present time, then alone could the existence of the omniscient person be cognised on the strength of analogy.” 
Finding that all men of the present time are not omniscient,—the certainty is derived from analogy based upon this similarity, that all other men (of the past and the future) could not be omniscient.” “Some one may accept the omniscient person on the following grounds: (a) ‘the teachings of Buddha relating to dharma and adharma cannot be explained, if there be no omniscient person;—thus from presumption, one can admit the omniscient person,—even though it has been shown that perception and the other means of cognition are not capable of affording the knowledge of the said person’.” 
b) or, this argument in support of the existence of the omniscient person may be stated in the form of the following inference of the sāmānyatodṛṣṭa kind (difference from the universal to the particular):—in every other case teaching is found to be preceded by the knowledge of the thing taught, and wherever there is teaching, it is always preceded by the knowledge of the subject taught; as in the case of the potencies of harītakī and such things;—the teaching of dharma and a dharma, has been given by Buddha;—hence it is inferred that the teaching must have been preceded by a knowledge of those matters.” 
As the fact is capable of another explanation, the presumption (put forward) has no efficacy (in proving the existence of the omniscient person). For the same reason, the inference that has been put forward is not valid. for instance, the fact of Buddha and others having taught dharma, etc. can be explained in another way—For instance, as being due to dreams, or to delusion, or to the Veda itself, or to wrong teaching.” 
Those who are ignorant of the Veda cannot have their teaching based upon the Veda; it can proceed from delusion only. in the world the teachings that are propounded by wicked teachers are not based upon the Veda; they proceed either from delusion or for the purpose of duping the disciples.” 
If the teaching of Buddha had been based upon the Veda, it would have been imparted to only such persons as were Vedic scholars,—just like the teachings of Manu and others, as a matter of fact, however, Buddha’s teachings are found to have been imparted to ignorant persons and Śūdras; hence it must be defective and illusory, like the making of counterfeit coins.” 
As regards Manu and others, who are well-known among Vedic scholars, and whose compilations are accepted by Vedic scholars,—their assertions have their source in the Veda.” 
It is not conceivable that these teachers should have compiled their works and then imparted them to others,—without having found, or showed to the pupils, the original Vedic texts.” 
If proofs were adduced to prove that ‘there is some one who is omniscient’, or that ‘there is omniscience in some man’,—then that would fall short of your proposition. In fact these assertions do not represent what is meant to be proved. There is no purpose in proving what is asserted in the above form,” “By proving some omniscient person in general, you cannot get at that particular person whose omniscience you are asserting for the purpose of establishing the truthfulness of his word.” “So long as Buddha is not proved to be omniscient, his words remain false (unreliable). How can the truthfulness of Buddha be established by the proving of some omniscient person in general?” 
The omniscience of one person cannot establish the truthfulness of the word of another person. It is only when the two are co-substrate—that they support one another.” 
The argument put forward is]—‘All the things that there are in this world must be perceptible to some person,—because they are entities, cognisable and knowable,—like the curd, colour, taste and other things’.—Inasmuch as mere knowledge is mentioned, it falls short of the original proposition (of the Buddhist); so that the ‘omniscient person’ whose existence is desired to be proved does not become established in this manner.—If some person other than Buddha had become omniscient, of what use could this knowledge be in the proving of the reliability of the words of Buddha?” 
When he occupies the ten stages, and all his attachment and other defects have ceased, then alone he can apprehend all things, through his knowledge which is like pure crystal. when rapt in meditation, his mind concentrated on the idea of all things, he would be pervaded by all things; and would not be able to impart any teachings.” 
At the time that he would teach some one thing, like any ordinary speaker,—it would be the assertion of a man with partial knowledge, not that of an omniscient person.” 
The following assertions have been made (by Buddhists)—‘when Buddha is rapt in communion, and stands unruffled like the cintā-jewel,—teachings issue forth, freely, from even the walls; and with the help of these, men come to know all that they want to know; and thus they quickly secure all that is good for them’.—Such assertions sound well only when addressed to people imbued with faith; we however are wanting in that faith, and hence ask for reasons.” 
Teachings issuing from the walls could not be accepted as taught by a reliable person. In fact, there would be no confidence in them,—it being doubtful by whom they have been propounded—have they been propounded by Buddha, or by deceitful Brāhmaṇas [?], put forward in joke, by means of words bearing the semblance of the words (of Buddha),—or by petty unseen elementals and others.—For these reasons, people who regard themselves as wise should place no confidence in such teachings.” 
thus then, there is no room for the omniscience of men. We now proceed to consider why the omniscient person has been postulated?—Your omniscient person—does he apprehend all things by a single cognition? Or by several cognitions? And then, does he apprehend them all at once? Or in succession—noticing only the more important things? In no case has it been seen that a single cognition apprehends such contradictory things as pure and impure and so forth; nor have several divergent cognitions been found to appear at one and the same time.—Who too is there who could apprehend, even in hundreds of years, each of the endless number of things, past, present and future?—Even if the person, by his own undiversified nature, apprehends all things,—he cannot apprehend the specific individualities of all things. Under the circumstances, what would be the use of the omniscient person who knows the things only in their general form? Specially as in no other form is the thing apprehended.—Then again, this uniform cognition could be either true or false.—If it be held to be true, then this would be contrary to perceived facts; as it would mean that all is one, without a second; and the result of this would be that there would be no such diverse entities as the disciple, the omniscient person, dharma, adharma, and the teachings of the said person; as the distinctive features of these would not be cognised.—If the one uniform cognition be held to be false, the omniscient person turns out to be a deluded person; so that no confidence should be reposed in his words, which are like the words of demented and intoxicated men.—If then the omniscient person is held to be that person who apprehends all things and their causes, through a single abnormal cognition brought about by communion,—then there can be no means of cognition to vouch for his existence,—in the shape of perception or inference or word, that is not produced by that person himself. Hence the conclusion would be that such a person does not exist.—Whether simultaneously or successively, how could there be any inference without an effect?—As a matter of fact, a certain person can either have no potency at all, or if he has, then he would have all potencies; so that all beings would be able to have the cognition of all things. And yet as a matter of fact, wanting in the necessary means, people do not cognise all things.—The idea that ‘there is one person who has acquired special powers not common among men, and he knows all things’—is entirely baseless.—Thus then, no omniscient person of any kind is conceivable. Consequently no human assertion could be the means of providing the knowledge of dharma.” Thus have the Mīmāṃsakas argued, being firm believers in the self-sufficiency of the Veda.—But we have already proved in detail that the Veda is the work of a person.—Hence the conclusion is irresistible that there is a person who has the direct knowledge of all things; and no one can know things by means of the eternal word, which is an impossibility
The ‘eternal word’ can never have the capacity to bring about the cognition of its own meaning;—because there is incompatibility between ‘succession’ and ‘simultaneity’
From this it follows that things like heaven, sacrifice and the like have been spoken of by the person who knew them by himself. In fact, under your view also the author of the Veda would be such a person capable of perceiving supersensuous things;—or a person who knows all about primordial matter, spirit and other things; or one who knows of all things.—In fact, if such an author were not 
Further, what has been asserted—as to the impossibility of any one knowing all hairs and nails, etc.—is without any basis, due entirely to ignorance; because it is quite possible that there may be some one for whom all things become manifested by the clear and unflinching light of knowledge and no reason has been adduced against such possibility
Mere ‘non-apprehension’ cannot prove his non-existence. because apprehension is neither the ‘cause’ nor the ‘pervader’ of things
When there is absence of (a) the ‘cause’ and (b) the ‘pervader’, it is only right and proper that there should be absence of (a) the ‘caused’ and (b) the ‘pervaded’; (a) because the birth of the one proceeds from the other, and (b) because one is of the same nature as the other;—for example, when there is absence of (a) the fire and (b) the tree, there is absence of (a) the smoke and (b) the ‘mango-tree, etc.’—If it were not so, (a) the one could not be the cause of the other, and (b) there would be diversity
If your own apprehension is recognised—through some means of cognition, as being the ‘cause’ and the ‘pervader’, of all things,—then your own omniscience becomes established, without any effort. why then should you yourself be hostile to your own omniscience? 
For these reasons, the omniscient person cannot be one ‘capable of being perceived’; if he were capable of being perceived, then that alone would establish his omniscience, without any effort on our part. in fact, how can that person be perceptible to you who has knowledge of all things,—unless you also had the knowledge of all things? 
As a matter of fact, any ‘non-apprehension’—in the case of things of the nature of the ‘pervader’, the ‘cause’ and the ‘nature’ of the omniscient person—would not be operative, because by his very nature, he is imperceptible
This ‘non-apprehension’ proceeds in nine ways: due to its being put forward in diverse ways consisting of the non-cognition and cognition of the said three and their contraries (respectively). And when in its very basic form, the ‘non-apprehension’ has been shown to be inapplicable to the omniscient person, the others become set aside without much effort
Effect and cause, pervaded and pervader, and contrariness—all these,—as also the ‘nature’ of the thing with a qualification—are possible only when the thing is perceptible.—The omniscient person, however, is not perceptible for you; hence all these ‘non-apprehensigns’ are not capable of proving his nonexistence; and any other factor of negation, there is none, 
If the omniscient person is denied on the ground of mere ‘non-apprehension’,—then you might also deny the marriage of your own mother and such other facts
If it be urged that—“on seeing the effect in the form of the son, there is cognition of the cause of that effect”,—then (the answer is that) in certain cases, the effect is found in the absence of the cause in question
If it is said that—“the non-existence of the marriage is not cognised, because other people know of it then (the answer is) how do you know that other people know of it? 
We know it from the assertion (of other persons)”.—Then (the answer is) is there not such assertion in regard to the omniscient person also?—Then again, how is it that you do not recall another assertion of yours to the effect that—“men are always found to be liars”? And just as there can be no confidence in the words of men regarding present things, so also there can be none in the words speaking of past things
Or, there may be no such assertion (regarding the existence of the omniscient person); nor may such assertion be reliable; even so, you have come to the certainty that “the omniscient person is not apprehended by any man”; and such certainty could be possible only if the souls of all men were known to you; and if all these were known to you, then you yourself would be omniscient,—as has been pointed out above
If it were not so, then, even on non-apprehension, there would be doubt only (regarding the existence of the omniscient person),—just as there is regarding the existence of certain things.—There are some saintly persons too who are believed to have knowledge of the omniscient person—it is also conceivable that the omniscient person, being self-luminous, perceives himself by himself.—For these reasons there can be no certainty regarding the non-apprehension of the omniscient person by all men
Because the term ‘all’ stands for all living beings; and the person himself must be included in ‘all’; hence there can be no certainty regarding the non-apprehension (of the omniscient person)
By the exclusion of that one person alone, what connection could there be (of this with the non-existence of the omniscient person)? One’s own illness does not cease merely because other people do not know of it
Even some men with limited vision do apprehend the omniscient person through inference; and it is only a few notions of some people that are perfectly correct. For instance, the proof of the momentary character of the veda, the earth and other things though clearly stated by us, has not been understood by dull-witted men. Consequently, the matter is open to doubt and the absence of apprehension cannot be certain,—simply because some people are sure that they! perceive his non-existence
Even if there be no inference, that alone cannot bring, about certainty regarding non-existence (of the omniscient person); as in the case of the existence of the fire which has not yet begun to emit its effect in the shape of smoke
In the case of a thing that has been apprehended at some time or the other, it is possible that there may be doubt; as for instance, in the case of the post, which partakes of the nature of both factors (of the doubt); because the post and the man have both been seen somewhere, therefore it is possible that there should be doubt as to its being this or that. The omniscient person, however, has never been thus perceived.” 
In this manner, o clever man, the non-existence of your mother’s marriage becomes established ‘free from all doubt’
We hold that there is doubt also when there is no valid cognition; it arises in regard to existence as well as non-existence, from the absence of the operation of any of the means of right cognition
When there is a defect in the eye, there is no cognition, even though the thing is there; and even when the eye is free from defects, there is no cognition, because the thing is not there;—as in the case of things like the jar.—Thus, inasmuch as mere non-apprehension (absence of cognition) is found in both cases, it is far better to hold that it is doubt that arises from the non-apprehension of the omniscient person
Though existent, he would not be seen directly by dull-witted persons; just like the conceptions of other people. Nor is he constantly active, just as the fire in the iron-ball is not active. Even when there, his activity would not be perceptible, like the feeling of love arising in others out of their fancies. Even if his activity would be perceptible, his connection with such action would not be cognised because the person knowing all things is always imperceptible for people whose eye of cognition is dull. It is for this reason that his existence cannot be proved by means of inference. It has been already explained that there can be no ‘cause’ or ‘pervader’ in his case. And yet it has been seen that even when the inference of the thing is not possible, the thing does exist. Thus it is that the matter (of the non-existence of the omniscient person) remains in doubt
Thus, then, there is nothing that can set aside the existence of the omniscient person; the proof in support of his existence is going to be adduced later on
It is with a totally different motive that the wise Buddhists make an attempt to establish the knowledge of all things,—even though such attempt prove futile
What is primarily and directly understood by us is that there is a person who knows the means of attaining heaven and liberation;—but not this alone; it is also believed that there is a person who also knows all things
Thus then, there being no reasons against, while there is clear reason in support of it,—why should dull-witted persons object to the idea of the omniscient person? Even if there be no proof in support of it,—so long as there is no reason definitely against it,—the matter should remain in doubt; on what could this certainty of these people be based? 
The assertion that—“the Veda alone—and nothing else—is able to provide knowledge of the past, etc.—could be true only if the non-existence of the other sources were certain
The proof in support of the person knowing primordial matter and the spirit and other things, as also of the person knowing all things, has been already declared before, and later on another proof also is going to be set forth.—Hence it is not for nothing that people take the trouble of proving the existence of the person knowing the minute details of the whole world, by means of enthusiastic treatises and discussions
As perception and other means of cognition regarding the omniscient person cannot be discarded, it does not follow that morality and immorality are cognisable through the reliable word only
3315) The doctrine of the mīmāṃsaka being thus demolished, the attempt that the other party has made to refute the omniscient person has been made through sheer stupidity
The ‘person cognisant of dharma’ not being refuted, on account of the root not being cut off,—if people have asserted the existence of omniscient persons they have shown their wisdom by this
If the omniscient person had experienced the unclean taste, etc. through the contact of his gestatory organ, then alone could he be regarded as blameworthy. As a matter of fact however, things,—even those that are deprecated under ‘illusion’,—become cognised by him without actual contact, through the mind, whose perceptiveness has been brought about by the impressions of past experiences
It is because ho word of tāyin are found to provide knowledge of things mentioned in the Veda, that he is ‘omniscient it is quite possible too that he had knowledge of all false philosophical doctrines also; as he does make the declaration that what is asserted in the Veda regarding the soul and other things is wrong
The doctrine of ‘no-soul’ has been clearly taught by him for the benefit of his disciples—the doctrine which is the unique gateway to the highest good, and the fright of all upholders of wrong doctrines
It is not known to the worldly man; when known, it sets aside all evil; for those who are devoted to its practice, it is a veritable mine of valuable qualities. If the poets know this highest truth, then who is there who would not regard them, knowing the primordial matter, the spirit and other things, as omniscient? 
This knowledge of the doctrine of ‘no-soul’ as described does not belong to vardhamāna and others; in fact, all philosophers have become lost in the doctrine of the ‘soul’,—all such doctrines as the ‘syādvāda’ and others involving the notions of things being not-momentary, are discarded by direct perception; how then can persons who have asserted' many such unreasonable things be ‘omniscient’? People who tremble over things that are perceptible and known even to the ploughman,—how could they ever have any clear knowledge of things that are beyond the senses? Thus the fact of these persons being not-omniscient is clearly understood from their being attached to wrong doctrines and expounding wrong teachings; just in the same way as any other man who perceives the man in the post is said to be mistaken.—One is to be recognised as omniscient only when he has been found to satisfy all tests and all reasons, and has been found to have the true knowledge of all things.—Thus then our reason should not be regarded as being one whose contrary is open to doubt
If the assertion of these teachers regarding the ‘syādvāda’ and other doctrines be said to have been made with some (other) motive,—then (we ask)—what is that form of things which they hold to be real and true? 
There is no soul;—things are momentary and so forth.”—If that is so, these teachers are omniscient; because they have directly perceived the true nature of all things. In that case they are all omniscient, holding the same view of things. As for the mutually contradictory teachings, they never expounded any such teachings,—they meant something quite different
The Buddhas are omniscient only because they have the direct knowledge of truth regarding all things, as explained above. If then this same knowledge belongs to the other teachers also, then they also are ‘Buddhas’ and their ‘Buddha-hood’ does not differ from that of the Buddha; because they also possess perfect knowledge, and this is the sole characteristic of the Buddha
Thus, though the omniscient person whose existence has been proved is only such a person in general, yet in reality, it is Buddha alone who stands out as the only such person; as it is only he in whom all the characteristics of the omniscient person are present
Even when one is specifically singled out, that person alone could be omniscient who knows the whole world in its real form of ‘being without soul’ and the rest
When one has perceived the fact of there being no soul,—no defect can obtain a footing in him; because it is its contradictory. Just as when the bright lamp is there, there can be no darkness
Also, on account of the peculiar character of the direct perception, the defect along with the dispositions ceases forthwith; and thus through freedom from all ‘obstacles’, omniscience becomes accomplished
In fact, this (omniscience) that has been proved is that of Buddha himself, as it is he who, at the very outset, expounded the doctrine of ‘no-soul’. That is why he stands at the head of all philosophers
There can be no equality between this teacher endowed with the true knowledge of truth, and other teachers who have expounded false doctrines. The knowledge of these latter is not vouched for by any means of right cognition, and their word is beset with annulment; therefore the capacity to know supersensuous things must be very far away from them
The words of Buddha are] well-knit,—they propound a compatible method,—and set forth what is useful for men; even in regard to perceptible things, they are not, in the least degree, annulled by the two means (and forms) of cognition
The words of Buddha] are free from impurities, like gold tested by ‘heating’, ‘cutting’ and ‘touching’; and, like the gold, they do not undergo any change in the process of testing and investigation
The jewel-like word of Buddha, whose appearance is conducive to the destruction of the entire mass of the darkness of wrong notions, is never got at by men beset with sins. That is why wise men declared Buddha alone to be omniscient,—cognisant of all such things as primordial matter and spirits; he has been called the ‘great physician—thus there is the definitely certain cognition that Buddha is omniscient, not Kapila. Though this cognition has been clearly spoken of, it has not been understood by dull-witted men
From what has been said, it is also learnt wherein lies the distinction of the ‘suppressor of desires’ (Buddha) from ṛṣabha and other incompetent teachers
What fool is there who will regard a person who knows the letters of the alphabet only, as conversant with the essence of all the sciences,—merely on the ground of his possessing equal knowledge of food? Thus then, that reason by which the omniscience of one person is established is not available in the case of another person;—because the essence of that reason is absent in this latter case
Thus, those objections that the Buddhists, without anger, urge against the assertion of the omniscience of Jina,—the Jainas are not in a position to urge (against the Buddhist)
Because the truth that has been found in the buddhist doctrine, through proofs with well-established premises,—has not been so found in any other doctrine,—therefore please draw as many definite conclusions as you can, through various reasonings and counter-reasonings, which are well-founded and not swallowed by their own reflections
As a matter of fact, there is no incompatibility, direct or indirect, between the character of ‘knowing all things’ and that of ‘being cognisable, etc.’—in fact ‘cognisability’ is proved by the ‘absence of incognisability’, not by the ‘absence of omniscience’; this latter therefore retains its character
Omniscience has never before been seen to appear on the appearance of its complete cause,—by virtue of which it could be said to cease on the appearance of the character of ‘being an entity’ and so forth
The affirmation of what is not incompatible cannot be rightly regarded as setting aside the other. otherwise the presence of colour might mean the absence of taste
In this matter, the ‘speakership’ of the lord being implied by the first word uttered by him, a certain party thinks that there is an incompatibility between such ‘speakership’ and ‘omniscience’, and hence concludes that there can be no ‘omniscience’; because there can be ‘speakership’ only when there is ‘conceptual content’, while one could be ‘omniscient’ only if there were no ‘conceptual content’; as a matter of fact, (he urges) an entity is never apprehended by a cognition associated with verbal expression.—As regards this reasoning also, those who think that the ‘speakership’ of the omniscient person follows from cogitation and thinking, do not admit the omniscient person on the ground of his being a ‘speaker’; nor on the ground of his conceptual knowledge; in case, however, there is no ‘conceptual content’, there can be no ‘speakership’
Even so, it cannot be right to regard his words as those uttered by one who is not-omniscient; because his non-omniscience has been discarded by his omniscience; hence there should be agreement. for instance, having experienced heat, one speaks of it [and this speech is reconciled, in agreement, with the previous experience or cognition]; from this there is no disagreement with the real state of things, because the speech is the outcome of the direct cognition of those things. thus then, at the time when the lord is omniscient, the reason adduced by the other party is not present; and as regards the time of ordinary usage, his argument would be superfluous
Even if you deny the capacity to know all things, your reason still remains open to the charge of its presence in the contrary of the probandum being doubtful.—Even if you wish your reason to consist in the capacity to use, the same defect, of the possibility of its presence in the contrary of the probandum, persists
Even when Tāyin (Buddha) is free from conceptual content, his teachings go on under the force of the initial momentum,—in the manner of the revolutions of the wheel’;—even against the wise men who hold this view, the argument of the other party is of no avail
3368-3369a) The ‘speakership’ that is popularly conceived by men,—if that is put forward as the reason, then it would be open to the charge of having its presence in the contrary of the probandum possible
3369b-3370a) “When the doctrine in question has no reason in its support,—what sort of ‘inadmissibility’ would there be in regard to it?”b) 
Our answer is as follows:—if ‘speakership’ by itself, is meant to be the reason, then it is one whose substratum is unknown,—or its ‘inadmissibility’ is suspected. In fact, the exact connotation of the word being doubtful, the fact remains that it is one whose ‘inadmissibility’ is suspected. Consequently, if you have to urge such an argument, you can do so only as a reductio ad absurdum.—And in such an argument what has to be urged must be what is knowable only from the scriptures (of the other party); and there can be no other means of proving its existence
When reasons such as ‘being known’, ‘being an entity’, ‘being’ and so forth are incapable of setting aside the omniscient person,—who is there who will not admit his existence?—Thus no reason, either temporal or scriptural, that the upholder of the Veda can have in his mouth, is capable of removing the poison of the awful serpent in the shape of the knowledge of the Śākya.—In fact, the feeble and dull-witted Brāhmaṇa, even when merely glanced at by the poison from the eyes (of that serpent), becomes unable even to breathe,—what to say of setting it aside! Any reasoning, even when sound, becomes ugly in the mouth of the Vedic scholar,—on account of its abundance in a lowly substratum; just like the string of beads placed at the feet
He cannot assert even the infallibility of the concomitance between smoke and fire; because, under his view, smoke exists elsewhere also; in fact, being of the one uniform nature of ‘entity’, it exists in the ocean also; and if fire exists there also, then where would the absence (of the probans) lie? 
Why should not then there be recognition of the form and of the effects of fire in water also?—The only other alternative is that the nature of the two things being distinct, the difference among things must be real
The only evidence that is suggested is that of the mental cognition of omniscience as brought about by the repeated practice of the ‘truth’ relating to all things;—and not the ordinary visual and other cognitions. Under the circumstances, how can it be asserted that the said person should cognise taste, etc. through the eye?—As regards mental cognition of things like colour and the rest, it has been accepted, without dispute, even by the other party; in fact, it is on the basis of this mental cognition that the remembrance of colour and other things has been said to be produced.—During dreams also, there is mental cognition in the shape of the apprehension of all things.—Thus then, the omniscient person being postulated on the basis of mental cognition, the scope of which is not restricted,—how could he cognise taste, etc, through the eye? This objection might apply, if he were held to know all things through the eye itself. As a matter of fact however, he does cognise taste and other things collectively, through the mind.—Even in cases where some superior peculiarity is found (in the cognitions of the omniscient person), in regard to the perception of subtle and remote things,—it is all within the scope of the said mind and mental concepts; and it is not due to the functioning of the auditory organ on colour; all these undesirable contingencies that other people have urged against us are not applicable to us at all; because all the superiority and peculiarity lies in the mental cognition itself, and it does not lie beyond the scope of this cognition. Thus then for us, the things that were cognised in the past by certain means of cognition are precisely the same that are cognised now by the same means of cognition
Or, all cognition, when pure, would, as a rule, apprehend all things; though in a certain case, there may be some peculiarity in the resultant of the cognition, due to particular causes. For instance, the āmalakī is found to yield a smaller fruit; because the āmalakī growing in the desert has been found to yield a small fruit, it does not necessarily follow that it will always, in other places also, produce fruits of the same small size.—Similarly, there is the assertion that serpents hear through their eyes.—In fact, the capacities of, action belonging to all things are wonderful and anything might be possible for them
Such an assertion can sound well only when proceeding from one who has the apprehension of all things at all the three points of time, as restricted in their capacity
Such an assertion as that]—“The perception of certain things through certain causes in the past was exactly as it is found at the present time”.—As a matter of fact, even at the present time, it cannot be known what the capacity of people is, by you, who are a mere animal devoid of the definite knowledge of the capacity of all things. In fact, if you had the knowledge of the capacity of all things, omniscience would indeed be yours!—nor can it be known by means of inference, as there would always be a suspicion regarding its being otherwise
It is found that on account of the capacity to perceive supersensuous things also, the presence of intelligence and other qualities is perceived as arising from the force of their learning, etc. for instance, there is the art of ‘īkṣaṇika’ (thought reading?) which, properly practised, brings about, even during the present life, the knowledge of what is passing in another man’s mind: and (with its help) people come to know and describe things past, present and future, that have not been either inferred or heard of during the present life. Similarly, people are distinctly and truly found to be possessed of the capacities of curious incantations, nāgas, demons and spirits of all kinds.—all this may not be seen, and yet there is no proof for denying it. Hence it cannot be said that he does not exist, 
The author of the Veda having been established in the manner above described, you have to admit of the person capable of perceiving supersensuous things. In this way, the intelligent man would be able to see subtle things, and while transcending the limitations of his own kind, he would be rising above other men
3402-3403) Just as the capacity of the ear and other sense-organs in relation to their objects, becomes improved by special exercise, medication and other means,—so would be the case with the mind also
For example, vultures are able to see things lying at a very great distance: and people are enabled to perceive hidden treasures and other things by the use of unguents and collyrium with magical powers
In the same manner, through special exercises, one would be enabled to see the celestial and other beings, as also things subtle, hidden and so forth,—in accordance with his own limitations
Through particular practices of Yoga, the mind of the mystics and their cognitions come to be of superior order. there can be nothing incongruous in this
When the existence of the omniscient person is asserted, it is not on the basis of his knowledge of any one part of things,—in view of which the knowledge of the Veda and the allied subjects could make heaven, etc. perceptible to him. What we find in him is a superior grade of wisdom, mercy and such qualities brought about by constant practice,—and from our knowledge of these qualities we deduce our knowledge of his other kinds of superiority also. And as these are qualities of the mind, there is every possibility of their rising to the highest stage.—Like the cruelty (of wicked people), the knowledge of all things reaches the highest stage, through constant practice; thus is that wisdom attained which consists in the knowledge of things; and it remains incomplete while even a single thing remains unknown
Then again, the grains that originally grew out of the seeds of the same kind, turn out gradually to be vastly superior, through the superior treatment that they receive. And as in the case of the vrīhi and other grains, so in the case of mercy, wisdom and other qualities also, it is quite possible that when these latter, endowed with the said character, reach their higher stages, there results omniscience
In things that are liable to deterioration in the presence of their opposites,—there comes about an utter deterioration,—as is pound in the case of the impurities in gold.—Afflictions, wrong notions of cognisable things and so forth, are all endowed with the said character (of deteriorating in the presence of their opposites): hence on the destruction of these, cognitions become free from impurities. If it is possible for these, endowed as they are with the said character, to have impurities,—then it is equally possible for their opposite to uproot that impurity
In some cases, there is absolute deterioration of things that obstruct the perception of truth, as is found in the case of the external as well as internal darkness. when there is deterioration of this, true knowledge appears untrammelled and proceeds to apply to the whole circle of knowable things
Or, those that subsist in a lasting substratum, having come about in it somehow, and—so long as there is no force to the contrary, they do not need any further effort towards bringing them about again,—these, by the excellence of the treatment they receive, reach the highest stage of perfection;—as for example, the purification of gold;—knowledge, mercy and such qualities are all of the said kind; so that when these have reached the highest state of perfection, there is brilliant omniscience.—nor can this reason be held to be fallible (false) in view of the two cases of jumping and water-heating; because jumping follows not from the jumping itself, but from strength and effort
Or, the jumping also is something that is capable of reaching the highest stage of perfection,—which would proceed from its own causes, through concentrated effort and strength: this capacity is named ‘manojava’ (mind-force). It is in connection with such capacity that we hear (and read) of such facts as that the lord reaches remote places by merely thinking of it.—The mere fact that such power is not seen cannot prove that it does not exist; nor can the opponent put forward any reason that could annul such an idea
The young rāja-haṃsa (swan) is unable to move out of the house even; but through practice, it becomes able to go beyond the ocean also. Just as this movement of his is the result of the exercise of the particular conditions of the receptacle (i.e. the body),—similarly, why cannot similar, or even higher, powers be possible (in the blessed lord)? at the preceding stage of the ‘Bodhisattva’, however, he is notable to attain such power of movement; but the great sage would certainly attain it on his reaching the highest state of ‘communion’
If a man is able to jump to the height of 15 feet, he could certainly acquire the capacity to jump to greater heights, through similar means
While the water is being heated, it is gradually undergoing destruction (evaporation); thus the substratum being not ‘lasting’, what and where would the ‘perfection’ lie? Of mental qualities, the substratum consists in the ‘chain of consciousness’; and this never ceases to function through its connection with its receptacle
As the flow of qualities goes on appearing in the ‘chain of consciousness’, so it goes on becoming more and more luminous
3434) This ‘consciousness’ is of the same nature as the ‘perception of truth’, and hence it is luminous, by its very nature; because impurities are all held to be adventitious
If consciousness were restricted to the cognition of something apart from itself, then, as it itself would not be cognised, there could be no cognition of things. Consequently consciousness has to be regarded as essentially ‘self-cognised’, specially because it is illuminative. Hence this consciousness remains as something free from all imposition
When, thus, the ‘path’ has become identified with him, there can be no suppression of it by love, hatred and other defects, since they had been already feeble before. The ‘path’—which is destructive of all defects,—having become thus identified,—there can be no loss of it without effort; and there can be no such effort, as its good points have been perceived.—Thus it is that Jina is understood to be the omniscient person adorned by a pure and firm host of good qualities, whose soul cannot be shaken by the storm of defects
Whatever things are conceived become clearly manifest, at the completion of the conception; as is found in the case of the objects of desire;—all things are conceived by great sages, for a long time and several times, in their real form, as ‘void’, ‘no-soul’ and so forth. That the ‘void’, ‘no-soul’ and the rest are the real forms has been proved before. Hence as arising out of the conception of really existent things, the said conception has been rightly regarded as right and valid
The cognition in question is vouched foe by ‘perception’, because it is clearly manifest, and is in keeping with the real nature of things; just like the appearance of blue and other things, arising from the contact of the eye and other sense-organs. The single clear appearance of all things in a single cognition is quite possible,—which please understand; also because things are so conceived of, like the woman, the son and the thief; conception too is not difficult to get at, as it can present itself before one by merely wishing for it
All things must be regarded as clearly manifested by the one cognition that represents the highest stage of the conception,—because of such reasons as ‘being entities’, ‘being existent’ and the like,—like the beloved woman and others.—Similarly, when the certainty regarding a thing is capable of being proved by such reasons as ‘being an entity’, ‘being existent’, ‘being produced’ and the like,——who is there who will not regard it as well-established? 
Dharma and other things must have been known to some person, without any verbal expressions,—because they have been taught by truthful men,—like the purity of gold and such things
It having been proved that the Veda is the work of a human being, our argument is not proving what is already proved (and hence futile). Mere random teaching of what is not known cannot be always true
As a matter of fact, there is no limit to the knowledge of man. Hence the statement in question is a mere assertion made without any reason
3467) Or, it may be that the statement made by ṛtuparṇa was with reference to common dull-witted persons like himself, whose minds have not been purified.—In support of the possibility of there being an omniscient person, we have already stated the proof in detail;—arguments to the contrary brought forward by other parties have also been refuted.—In fact, even if the proof in support of his existence had not been put forward, the mere annulment of the arguments to the contrary would have established the probability of his existence. Because where nothing against a certain idea is perceived, nor anything in support of it,—there arises a doubt regarding it; which indicates its probability. In fact, it is only when this probability is there, that there can be such an assertion to the contrary (made by the mīmāṃsaka) as that—“it is by means of the Veda alone that dharma can be known”
Even in regard to future things, the capacity of perception would be applicable, in the case of mystics,—as has been pointed out in the chapter on ‘the three points of time’
Or, through the powers of Yoga, the mental perception of mystics would clearly envisage the past and the future also, independently of inference and the word
As apprehending its own manifestation, it envisages a specific individuality; and as envisaging a clear and distinct manifestation, it is held to be perception.—Thus there is some one who perceives supersensuous things directly, and as there is no eternal word, one does not perceive anything through that
The wise men have declared that the knowledge of the sage of supersensuous things proceeds from the inference stated before,—not from any revealed word
Beginninglessness is not asserted in regard to the composer or to the utterances emanating from him,—for the purpose of proving their validity; because beginninglessness belongs to the invalid (wrong) cognition also; for instance, the unbelievers and their words,—as also the Vedas and their expounders,—are not valid and reliable, even though they may be beginningless
In fact, the beginninglessness of the expounders and of the eternal sentences that is asserted by you for the purpose of proving their reliability, is denied by us as a sheer counterblast
The expounders stand on the same footing as the composers; and dependent upon them is the reliability of the Vedas; because the knowledge of the meaning of the Vedas is derived from the explanations provided by the said expounders
In this way, the Vedic sentences, being dependent upon other things, cannot be reliable.—As regards the expounders, as they do not themselves perceive dharma, these also can never be reliable. Of such expounders, even though beginninglessness may be postulated, it would be in a position that is not reliable; and hence it would not be different in character from the beginninglessness of the unbelievers and others. Thus there being no difference discernible, all this comes to be on the same footing; so that neither reliability nor unreliability would be beginningless
In fact, there is this difference between the sage and those words,—that he perceived the dharma himself and expounded them through mercy
That is described as ‘dharma’ by all wise persons from which follows ‘prosperity’ and the ‘highest good’
As a matter of fact, wherever the rules laid down by him relating to incantations and communion and such things, are properly followed in practice, one becomes endowed with even such perceptible qualities as wisdom, health, power and so forth
From the realisation of the doctrine of the ‘soul-less-ness of all things’ as taught by him, follows the cessation of the whole mass of afflictions due to the notion of things having such existence. This notion of the reality of things appears in the form of ‘self’ and ‘things related to the self’, it is only when there are notions of ‘i’ and ‘mine’ that the whole mass of afflictions becomes operative.—The said perception of ‘soul-less-ness’ is the enemy of this notion of reality; hence when the former becomes duly absorbed and realised, the latter disappears; therefore the entire mass of afflictions due to that notion of reality ceases, on account of the absence of its cause; and when that ceases, there is no more birth due to that. Thus there being absolute liberation from birth, this state is spoken of as the ‘final goal’.—Thus the perception of ‘soul-less-ness’ is the door to unrivalled ‘good’.—All other philosophers have held that liberation follows from the cessation of the ‘i-notion’; but if there is a ‘soul’, this ‘i-notion’ can never cease; because its efficient cause would always be there; so the objective of that notion too would not be abrogated. If it were abrogated, there would be negation of it, which would mean a complete volte-face on their part
The notion ‘i am not’ cannot be right if the ‘i’ really exists. or else, it is not true ‘that one who knows the truth must attain nirvāṇa
Thus then, under other systems, there is just a little ‘welfare’ (prosperity) secured through the destruction of the ‘ten sins’;—the attainment of the highest good there is none in the least: and the reason for this lies in the fact that all these are associated with the notion of the ‘real existence’ (of the soul) and hence the root of the ‘afflictions’ is not removed
On the other hand, the ‘ten noble paths’ that have been taught by Tāyin (Buddha) are embedded in true knowledge and hence they are sufficiently powerful
Those others are clothed in the notion of the real existence (of the soul) and involve a ‘Volte face’:—as such they are not pure; consequently pure results do not flow from them.—Thus then, if one does not himself perceive in the great sage the teacher of the essence of dharma, and consequently remains ignorant of dharma,—how can he attain peace of mind? 
The ‘omniscience of Buddha’ and the ‘eternality of the Veda’ have not been declared by any wise man to stand on the same footing; and this because the said eternality is impossible. The argument against it has been already pointed out, as consisting in the incompatibility involved in ‘simultaneity’ and ‘successiveness’;—by reason of this it cannot bring about any such effects as cognition and the like
As regards the argument that the omniscient person is not seen at the present time—by you or by all men,—this has been already answered in detail. As regards non-perception by you, that, by itself, is ‘fallible’, ‘inconclusive’, as regards non-perception by all other men, that must remain always doubtful
3503-3504) “His existence in the past cannot be presumed in the way in which his non-existence has been presumed”—This assertion in regard even to the past cannot be right; because such denial is impossible
The following might be urged—“The period that is past was devoid of the omniscient person,—because it was a period of time,—like the present time which is actually perceived”.—This argument however, is not right, as its contrary is open to doubt; inasmuch as there can be no certainty regarding the present time being devoid of the omniscient person
It is quite possible that what existed in the past is not there in the present because the whole set of its causes is not present. Why should it not be that such a person existed in the past,—like Rāma and others? 
Wisdom’ and the rest hate been made the ‘subject’, and then the inferential indicative has been set forth; hence it is not true that ‘no indicative is recognised’,—and yet we are not seeking to prove the existence (of the person)
We are not affirming the existence of the omniscient person on the basis of scriptural declarations. When the inferential reason is available, who would make an assertion on the basis of verbal authority? 
But if you regard the Veda as reliable, then, how is it that you, deluded people, do not apprehend the omniscience of the blessed lord? as a matter of fact, in the Vedic rescensional text called ‘nimitta’, the learned Brāhmaṇas clearly read of the revered great sage as ‘omniscient’
He is described as] one who, having shown himself in a dream as a six-tusked white elephant, was born as one going to be a Bodhisattva, the ocean of fine qualities, his fame proclaimed, omniscient, full of mercy, attaining the state of immortality, pure, the father of the whole world
If this rescensional text just mentioned is not accepted as such,—then, for that, we can discover no reason except sheer hostility on your part. Because accentuation and other properties that belong to the Vedic text are all possible in regard to this text also: specially as these properties are dependent upon the mere whim of men
As a matter of fact, no scriptural text to this effect can be found; but if such an assertion were eternal, then it could be only commendatory; and if it really spoke of a person, then it would be not-eternal.” 
As regards the words of the Veda, as they are self-sufficient, their meaning could not be ascertained from the Veda itself;—nor from the learner by himself,—or from some other person,—who might be under the influence of delusion and other disabilities. Under the circumstances, how could there be any certainty regarding the assertion that—‘what is meant by the Vedic words—agnihotram juhuyāt svargakāmaḥ—is not that Jina is omniscient? 
That one is ‘omniscient’ is understood only from the clear teaching that he imparts regarding heaven and the highest good: Because that bears testimony to his knowledge of the most important matters. Of what use is the knowledge of the number of sands of the seas? What then have we got to do with his knowledge of other things? 
That the descriptions should be understood in the figurative sense, like the mantra and Arthavāda texts,—would be right only after the actual existence of the omniscient person had been rejected.—As a matter of fact however, there is nothing to annul the idea of such a person; while, on the contrary, his existence has been actually proved in great detail. So that the idea of all this being figurative must remain doubtful: inasmuch as it is possible for it to be true in its primary sense
In case the ‘untrammelled’ nature of his knowledge is regarded as true, in reference to such things as dharma and the like,—then clearly the Buddhists have won their case
3532) Because it has been proved before that it is the lord’s knowledge relating to prosperity and highest good, along with these matters (dharma and the rest), which is ‘untrammelled’:—this is quite clear even to the veriest piper
As regards the knowledge of self, brought about by the practice of meditation,—this also has been already proved to be ‘untrammelled’ in the case of those persons
That alone is knowledge of self which consists in the perception of the pure self,—as therein the only cognition is that of pure consciousness freed from all adventitious impurities
3535) It has been shown before that all cognition is in the form devoid of the apprehender and apprehended; it is free from the two aberrations. This is the cognition or knowledge that has been expounded by the Buddhas. That is what proves these to have been possessed of vast wisdom and of knowledge not conducive to birth and rebirth and it is the teachings inculcated under the guidance of these persons that are luminous to the present day
In regard to the luminous consciousness, not marred by the two forms,—who could entertain any wrong notions, if his mind is not deluded by the two forms?—As soon as there is recognition of the ‘soul-less-ness’ of both,—all those defects of love, hate and the like which have their source in the thoughts of women and such things, disappear without effort.—This is the highest truth which the ‘expounder of unity’ propounded,—which brings all kinds of prosperity, far beyond the reach’ of Keśava and others
Other people recognise the ‘soul’ as something permanent, resembling the pure rock-crystal; this idea of these people is clearly wrong, as the existence of the permanent ‘soul’ has been rejected. If the cognition envisaging the soul proceeds from one’s own soul, then there should be the cognition of all souls at one and the same time.—If it does not proceed from one’s own soul,—or if it is regarded as eternal,—then it could not envisage the soul at all:—being, in this respect like the cognitions of other persons
His knowledge does not consist in the direct perception of his pure self; because that is devoid of the characteristics of the ‘cognisable’, as has been proved in detail.—If the soul (self) is held to be of the nature of cognition (consciousness),—there can be no apprehension of it as such; because of the difference between the ‘seen’ and the ‘seeing’,—if then the said cognition is held to be self-illumined, then it comes to be ‘self-cognition’, and as such it would mean that the cognition is amenable to direct perception
There can be no connection between Brahmā (and others) and the Veda;a) because there is difference between them, (b) because both are regarded as eternal, and (c) because there is no mutual dependence;—just as in the case of any other thing.—Thus it is absurd to talk of Brahmā, etc. being ‘embodiments of the veda’.—Equally absurd it is to speak of the Veda as ‘consisting of all knowledge’; for the simple reason that the meaning of the Veda cannot be ascertained.—It has been explained that (for us) the omniscient person is recognised independently by himself; and he is not assumed on the ground of Brahmā and others being ‘embodiments of the Veda’
Being beyond the ‘metempsychic cycle’ consisting of the ‘five states’, the Buddhas are not held by us to be ‘mortal’, what has been regarded as their ‘birth’ is only the creation of themselves by themselves 
It is in the delightful city of Akaniṣṭha, free from the habitation of unclean beings,—that the Buddhas become awakened; and what is awakened here (in this world) is only their own creation’
How too do you ascertain, independently, the said ‘mortality’? Certainly not on the basis of the ‘scripture’ of other people; as what that scripture says has just been pointed out.—Nor do we postulate our ‘omniscient persons’ as rivals to the ‘omniscient persons’ postulated by others; who could ever conceive of any rivalry between real entities and ‘sky-flowers’? 
It has been proved by us that any eternal beings, being devoid of all capacity, must be formless. Hence it follows that the ‘three-eyed deity’ and other such beings, who are held by others to be omniscient, do not exist at all
Then again, the knowledge of those persons is all wrong, because it involves notions of the ‘soul’ and such other things. The knowledge of the Buddhas, on the other hand, is not wrong; as has been explained in detail. There is therefore no comparison made between these two sets, on the ground of greater or less proximity; who could institute any comparison between the blind and the man with perfect eyes? 
In fact, the eternality of all such things as quality, action, god, as also of the Vedas, has been totally rejected. Consequently we do not admit of any eternal ‘scripture’
We do not hold that the existence of the omniscient person is proved by analogy; because it has been shown that analogy is not a reliable means of cognition. Hence the said existence could not be proved by it. It is only when the existence of a thing has been cognised, that its similarity can be perceived; and what is desired to be proved in the present context is the existence of the all-knowing person;—and this cannot be proved by means of analogy. Hence your denial of this (in reference to the said person) is entirely futile.—If all men have been perceived by you to be not-omniscient,—then omniscience belongs to you yourself, since you perceive all men, those near you as well as those remote;—and since you perceive the capacity of cognitions appearing in the ‘chain’ of all other men
Even if the person were standing before you, how could you have the certainty that ‘he is not omniscient’? if you had this knowledge, you would be cognisant of things beyond the senses!—If you deduce the fact of all persons being not-omniscient from seeing that you yourself are not so,—then, there would be this incongruity that (your) Brahmā and other deities would deduce the omniscience of all persons from their own omniscience.—If it be urged that—“there is conviction regarding the presence of such qualities in all men only when we do not perceive anything to the contrary”, then our answer is that in regard to the matter under consideration, the mere suspicion to the contrary has the same effect as the actual perception of that contrary
Who else except the fool can regard the teaching of the Buddhas as having its source in delusion,—when it has been proved to be the flawless exposition of the path to heaven and the final goal? 
It is indeed a great delusion that has been brought about by Buddha in his disciples who, during the present life itself, have attained, through it, prosperity, as also the highest stage of the alleviation of all afflictions of the mind! 
The teaching of the Buddhas is certainly not based upon the Veda; because it has been described as ‘flawless’, while the Veda is full of flaws
The said teaching of the Buddhas is not for any selfish purpose; in fact, the whole effort was made for the benefit of others. Thus it was that the all-merciful Buddhas taught that path to all men,—having made up their minds to bring about the welfare of the world, and thus being the disinterested well-wishers of all beings
Those teachers who were under the influence of greed, fear, hatred, jealousy, etc. and were devoid of mercy,—it is the teaching of such persons which could be partial and local
3570) Those teachers, on the other hand, who were led by mercy alone,—who had a clear perception of the truth,—who had no fear of any contradiction,—imparted their teachings to all. As a man, through ignorance, goes on being affected by defects, so there grows in the lords, mercy towards him.—They do not desire to establish any such connection with men as that of vivāha (marriage) or āvāha (home-coming of the bride) and so forth; the only thought in their mind is that of doing good to others. That is what has been so well sung of
3571-3573) ‘The wise ones view with equal regard—the Brāhmaṇa equipped with learning and character, the bull, the elephant, the dog and the dog-eater.’—[Bhagavadgītā]
Hundreds of times has the ‘genus’ (universal) been rejected; whence then is this pride due to ‘caste’ (genus)? specially when no superiority over others is perceived in it, why should it be regarded as superior? In fact, men belonging to other castes also are found, on the presence of particular qualities, to be the receptacle of qualities of self-control and free from all impurities. If, by reason of their connection with the particular (Brāhmaṇa) caste, they had been superior to others, in the matter of possessing the said qualifications, then alone could they be admitted to be really superior,—not if they merely belonged to the Brāhmaṇa caste, but in actual life were like fowlers, and others

A very long time has elapsed and women are very unsteady; hence it cannot be certain if there is Brāhmaṇa-hood in you. For you, there is no one who is cognisant of supersensuous things; nor has even the Veda declared the purity of your genealogy
Thus, Manu and other teachers, not knowing who were real Brāhmaṇas, could not have imparted the teachings to Brāhmaṇas alone: because they could not be sure of it
We suspect that Manu and other teachers, for some reason, came to realise that what is stated in the Veda is not quite reasonable and not quite comprehensible by itself,—And also that the Brāhmaṇas, having become dull-witted by the reading of the Veda, were incapable of discriminating things for themselves;—and it was for this reason that they expounded their teachings to the Brāhmaṇas alone
They have declared that]—“The Purāṇa, the dharmaśāstra propounded by Manu, the Veda with its subsidiaries, and the science of medicine,—these four are self-sufficient commandments, and should never be attacked with reasonings”,—this threat, in regard to the self-sufficiency of their authority, we think, was pronounced by them to the dull-witted people for the same reason. Or else, how could a mere verbal statement make anything self-sufficient in its authority? 
Those great teachers ox the other hand who were quite sure of the reasonableness of their own teachings and who were confident also of their own powers to expound those teachings,—having shaken off all fear, and bringing about the lowering of the arrogance of the maddened elephants in the shape of the false philosophers—always roar like lions, as follows
3586-3587) ‘O Bhikṣus, my words should be accepted by the wise, not out of regard for me, but after due investigation,—just as gold is accepted as true only after heating, cutting and rubbing’
3588) Those who are Brāhmaṇas in reality, by reason of having removed all their sins, and who have practised the teaching of ‘no-soul’,—are all within the purview of the great sage himself; it is for this reason that it has been declared that ‘herein is the śramaṇa’ who has been described under four classes; and the teachings of others are entirely devoid of the śramaṇa-brāhmaṇas
It has been explained that the proving of the proposition that ‘there is some man who is omniscient’ is not vitiated by the defect of falling short of our proposition
3591) This has been explained by us above (under text 3308) where it has been asserted that—it is with a totally different motive that the wise Buddhists make an attempt to establish the knowledge of all things, even though such attempt prove futile
As regards the argument that “what is asserted by one who knows only a part cannot be regarded as the assertion of the omniscient person”,—the answer to this has already been given, that it would be due to the actual presence of the knowledge of all things
3593) The man of limited vision, having perceived a few desirable things, fixes them in his mind, and subsequently describes them, on the basis of those perceptions;—and yet it is not that his words do not proceed from his knowledge of those things; the same would be the case with the assertion of the omniscient person; the difference would lie in the difference between the basis of the two assertions
3594-3595) What forms the source of the words (of Buddha) is the knowledge of all things; while the source of the words of the other person consists in the knowledge of only a few things
There being ho conceptual content in his case,—how could there, be any desire in him to speak? Inasmuch as he has renounced all activity, there can be no conceptual content for him.” 
It cannot be so; because, as regards the conception that is beset with afflictions, no such is possible in his case, as all ‘obscuration’ has disappeared from him. while that conception which is favourable to the world’s welfare and hence ‘healthy’,—who would prevent that? 
As a matter of fact, he does not recognise the conceptual content as beneficial (useful); he knows it to be baseless; he is like the magic-performer. The magic-performer knows that the idea that he has produced envisaging the real horse is really without an objective basis; and hence he himself does not become mistaken or misled by it
When the Brāhmaṇa (opponent) has asserted—that “such assertions sound well only when addressed to people imbued with faith”,—he has not said anything relevant to the subject under consideration
3601) The subject under consideration was the statement that “the omniscient person, being excluded from all things, could not be able to impart teachings”.—To this, the wise men made the answer—‘if he had no power to impart teachings, what would happen?’—The proper rejoinder for you should have been that—“in that case there would be no reliable scripture”.—What you have asserted is—“it may be so, but have you seen him actually speaking?”—Now if, in this, you are urging a reductio ad absurdum against us, then it should only mean as follows:—“If his speakership is not admitted, then there could be no getting at the scripture; hence if the scripture composed by him is admitted, his speaker ship also will have to be admitted.” 
If that is so, then, the principle accepted by all relationalists is that a reductio ad absurdum (in this case) can be urged only on the basis of a character that is accepted on mere faith; if it were based upon well-known reasons, there would be independent (direct) arguments in support. As a matter of fact, the scripture that is postulated by the other party (the Buddhist) as composed by the omniscient person, is as thus described—‘without any appurtenances, the teachings of that person proceed freely even from the walls,—as if they were coming out of the cintāmaṇi gem’.—Thus then it is purely through supervision that he is regarded as the ‘composer’ of the teachings; hence his speakership need not be associated with any conceptual content.—Thus then, when you assert that—“we are wanting in that faith and hence ask for reasons”—you do so without knowing what is meant by reductio ad absurdum
Why should words issuing from the walls not be accepted as taught by a reliable person,—when they are prompted by his over-lordship? 
Being devoid of teachings of mixed character and those of slaughter and such other evil things,—how could these teachings be the work of sportive goblins and others? in them, there is no teaching of mixed character; nor of slaughter and other evil things, which alone could be the work of sportive goblins and others.—All that lies within the purview of the two means or forms of right cognition is in strict accord with these; and nothing of the slightest thing contrary to them is vouched for by the two means of cognition. Even in regard to absolutely supersensuous things, the said teaching is not annulled by anything past or future; it prompts the manifestations of such qualities as compassion and the like; it is endowed with all forms, expounds right behaviour; it is conducive to various forms of welfare here and elsewhere; it teaches the antidote to all kinds of love, hatred and the rest; it opens the gate to the city of nirvāṇa.—If such teaching could be the work of playful persons or demons, then these same may be the ‘enlightened beings’, as fulfilling all the conditions of ‘enlightenment’! Merely by giving a different name to a thing, its real form does not become altered. In fact, if a man were to call the cultured ‘uncultured’,—he himself would be subject to the derision of all good people
In fact, it is in the case of words that are marked by the mention of sexuality, dishonest behaviour, animal-slaughter and so forth, and which speak of many barbarous acts,—that there is room for suspicion regarding their being the work of rogues, demons and the like. Such words are likely to proceed only from persons who are addicted to such practices
The simultaneous apprehension by one and the same cognition of mutually contradictory things,—like the pure and the impure and so forth,—has actually been found. because they are not incompatible with cognition
In the case of things that are mutually exclusive by their nature, or in those that can never coexist,—there may be incompatibility; but there is no incompatibility in both figuring in the one and the same cognition; because there is perception through the eye of such contraries as (a) the pure and the impure things, (b) the serpent and the peacock and so forth
That there is no simultaneous cognition in the case of pleasure and pain,—that should be understood to be due to the requisite cause being absent; there is nothing incompatible in it
3625) The various colours,—blue, yellow, white, etc.—though mutually incompatible, on account of the differences of place, origin, etc.—are actually seen at one and the same time
The omniscient person whose existence we have established is one who comprehends within a single cognitive moment the entire round of all that is to be known; it is for this reason that no succession is admitted in this case
Whatever he wishes to know he comes to know it without fail;—such is his power, as he has shaken off all evil. He knows things either simultaneously or in succession, just as he wishes; and having secured the knowledge of all things, he becomes the lord
3628-3629) Or, he knows all that is knowable, in the shape of the ‘four truths’, by means of his sixteen ‘cognitions’, in succession, and on that account he is omniscient. When this cognition of the lord thus appears in succession—not even a single moment has to be awaited; what to say, my friend, of a hundred years! 
The person who apprehends all things in their own undiversified form, knows the very forms of all things
3632) It is the ‘specific individuality’ itself, as differentiated from heterogeneous and non-momentary things, which is spoken of here as ‘universal’, on the ground of its leading to calmness and dispassion.—The cognition that apprehends this and is brought about by the force of medication, and appears only in great mystics, envisages the specific individuality itself
What is apprehended by the mystic consciousness is not that universal which is incapable of being spoken of as ‘that’ or ‘not-that’ and so forth, and which other people have regarded as real’
The consciousness of the mystic is free from conceptual content and is not erroneous; and if it apprehended the said universal, it would be something beset with conceptual content and error
Because it has been already explained that the universal which consists of the conceptual content and is incapable of being spoken of, and is in the form of permanent contiguity,—is formless (featureless)
That person is certainly called ‘omniscient’ who knows all things along with their causes, through a single abnormal cognition brought about by communion. The existence of such a person has been already established before, by means of inference. Thus there is a distinct means of cognition vouching for his existence. Hence it follows that such a one really exists
Simultaneously or successively, there is cognition following from the effect that is manifested. when he imparts the teaching, he has the requisite capacity also
That person who has propounded this teaching—which is pure and wherein the dharma of ‘no-soul’ has been reiterated,—and which has been supported by the whole of this work and not traversed by any form or means of valid cognition,—which is not known to worldly men,—which is beyond the ken of Keśava and others,—which is highly borne on the head by all wise men,—which destroys the entire host of enemies in the shape of evils,—and is the cause of various kinds op prosperity as also of the attainment of nirvāṇa,—such a person acquired special powers not common among men, which distinguishes him from all other men, and he alone is omniscient;—this is entirely vouched for by means and forms of right cognition
Thus, as it is quite conceivable that there is an omniscient person, human assertion can certainly be the means of providing the knowledge of dharma
Any discussion regarding formlessness and the rest is of no use in regard to the omniscient person. In fact, just as your cognition appears in regard to a certain object, so does the other (superior) cognition also
