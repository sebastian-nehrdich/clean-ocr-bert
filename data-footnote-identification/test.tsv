For cattle abiding in the field after eating the crops, the fine shall he double; and in every case the owner of the field shall receive the value of the crops that have been destroyed.’ Yājñavalkya (2.162).—‘In the case of a field on the roadside, or adjacent to the pasture-land of the village, if cattle is allowed to graze unintentionally, there is no offence; but if it is done intentionally, the man deserves punishment like the thief.’ Uśanas (Vivādaratnākara, p. 232).—‘If a man asks for compensation for the crops that may haves been grazed by a cow, his Pitṛs and deities do not accept his offerings.’ This verse is quoted in Aparārka (p. 769), which adds the following—‘The meaning of the verse is as follows:—With the exception of those fields which have been specifically mentioned by Manu to be such that for damaging their crops cattle are not to be punished;—if the crops of any other fields happen to be damaged, then the keeper is to be fined one kārṣāpaṇa and a quarter’;—this should be understood as referring to repeated and serious damage:—‘and in all cases of damage to crops by cattle, the estimated produce of the field damaged should be given to the owner.’ It is quoted in Vivādaratnākara (p. 234), which adds the following notes:—‘Anyeṣu,’ in the case of fields other than those lying on the outskirts of the village and so forth;—the ‘cattle’ (to be fined) should here be taken as standing for the keeper of the cattle;—it being impossible for the cattle to pay a fine; the fine should be understood to be a paṇa and a quarter for each head of cattle;—and in Vīvādacintāmaṇi (Calcutta, p. 65), which explains ‘anyeṣu,’ as, ‘lying at a distance.’ Gautama (12.21-26).—‘If the damage was done in an unenclosed field near the road, the responsibility falls on the herdsman and on the owner of the field.	0

Another explanation is that of the root pra + in also ‘reward’ is the nominative; the meaning of the participle in this case being ‘even though arriving near,’ ‘it does not come about,’—i.e., it fails to be enjoyed.—(139) The man who, through folly, makes friendships by means of Śrāddhas,—that meanest of twice-born men, having the Śrāddha for his friend, falls from the regions of heaven.—(140) ‘Friendships’—friendly relations—he ‘who make’ ‘by means of Śrāddhas’ ‘through folly—i.e., being ignorant of what is contained in the scriptures,—falls from heaven,’—i.e., never reaches heaven; the root ‘fall’ being used in the sense of want of connection in general; the sense being ‘just as a man on reaching heaven and falling from there loses all connection with it, so this man also.’ What is meant is that the man does not obtain the reward for performing the śrāddha.	1

“In as much as the work of Manu has had a beginning in time, how could any injunction relating to it (as the present verse   is supposed to be) be based upon the Veda, which is beginningless?” Our answer is as follows:—It is quite open to us to infer some such general (Vedic) injunction as that ‘the Śūdra should not study such sentences as serve to expound the scriptures.’ Further, these statements of the expounders of the Veda that serve to explain Vedic texts bear a certain resemblance to these texts; and hence they are as much the subject of a bcginningless tradition as the Vedic texts themselves.	1

Because for the other party also, there comes about an argument which is the reflection of the Buddhist argument; and thus being refuted by this, the argument (of the Buddhist) turns out to be the means of proving what is not true; and as such, it is not capable of setting aside the Vedic injunction which is inherently valid.”  The answer to the above is as follows:—as a matter of fact, the distinction that has been made has some basis only in regard to those things that are held to continue to exist after being produced It is only for the securing of their existence that things like the jar stand in need of a cause; when once they have secured their existence, they become operative by themselves towards their own effects 2921) That cognition which you also regard as not lasting after being born, becomes non-existent after having secured its existence; what sort of activity or operation, then, could it have?	1

There is no such hard and fast rule as that ‘alms should be begged from women only.’ Vīramitrodaya (Saṃskāra, p. 481) also quotes the verse, and supplies the formula as noted in Madanapārijāta;—Saṃskāramayūkha (p. 60) quotes it, and lays down the formula for the three castes as—(a) ‘bhavati bhikṣām dadātu’, (b) ‘bhikṣām bhavatī dadātu,’ and (c) ‘bhikṣām dadātu bhavati—Smṛticandrikā (Saṃskāra, p. 108), which mentions the formula as given in Madanapārijāta;—and also Vīramitrodaya (Vyāvahāra, p. 124).	0

And this would be contrary to the declaration of the Mahābhārata, where, in reference to the places of pilgrimage, it is said— ‘He satisfied his forefathers by means of śrāddha.’ As regards the text of the other Smṛti—‘livery year, the śrāddha shall be performed like the monthly performance,’—here also the ‘monthly śrāddha’ refers to the śrāddha on the Amāvasyā; as this latter is the archetype of all śrāddhas; and it is in connection with this that all the details have been prescribed.	1
It is quoted in Nirṇayasindhu (p. 176);—in Vivādaratnākara (p. 567), which adds the following notes—‘Āpadi’, when the adopter has no son;—‘sadṛśam’, of the same caste; but Medhātithi holds that the ‘equality’ is in qualities, not in caste;—‘prītisamyuktam’, free from all fear and such other motives;—and in Vyavahāramayūkha (p. 47), which reads ‘vā’ (for ‘ca’) and remarks that in the absence of the mother, the father alone may give away the son, or the mother may do it in the absence of the father; it goes on to controvert Vijñāneśvara’s view that the sin of giving away the son in normal times accrues to the giver, not to the adopter;—‘Sadṛśam’, equal in family-status and other qualifications, says Medhātithi; hence according to him the Kṣatriya also may be adopted by the Brāhmaṇa.	0

The Vedic injunction is of two kinds:—(a) There is one kind of injunction which is directly expressed by the words; e.g., ‘desirous of Brahmic glory, one should offer the Saurya-Caru’; here what is expressed is that one who desires Brahmic glory is the ñt and proper person to offer the Saurya-Caru; and when one proceeds to secure Brahmic glory by means of the said offering, he learns that the procedure of the offering is analogous to the Āgneya offering (which is the archetype of all Caru-offerings).	1
