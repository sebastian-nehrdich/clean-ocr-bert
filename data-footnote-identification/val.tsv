In verse 247 here—where it is said that ‘For the twice-born person just dead, there should be performed the rite upto Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa, one should do the feeding at his Śrāddha without any in honour of the gods, and he shall offer one ball;’—The ‘Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa’ or ‘Amalgamating Rite’ should be regarded only as partially binding in a case where the Father has died, while the Grandfather is still alive; i.e., it is to be performed only when no regard is paid to the prohibition contained in the words ‘one shall not make an offering that involves the ignoring of a living person.’ When, however, one accepts the view that ‘there should be precedence etc.	1

This verse is quoted in Vivādaratnākara (p. 120), which adds the following notes:—For the followers of certain recensions it is laid down in connection with the fire-kindling rites that the Adhvaryu is to receive the chariot the Brāhmaṇa priest a swift horse, the Udgātṛ priest, the cart in which the Soma is carried.—‘Kraye’ means at the purchase of Soma.—Hence the answer to the question raised in the preceding verse is that the special fee prescribed for a particular priest is to be given to that priest only; as it is only thus that the ‘giving’ would be done in its real sense; the mention of the priests in the texts prescribing the fees could not but be for this perceptible purpose; while in any other case such naming would have to be taken only as serving some transcendental purpose.	0
