Jayanta's Nyayamañjari became obscure in course of time in
North East India because of the eminence of Vacaspati Miśra,
Udayana, Gańgeśa Upadhyāya and Mimâmsakas. The rise of
Navyanyaya in Bengal is another prominent factor since the
Neo-logicians eclipsed the name and fame of their predecessors
to a great extent. The decline of the glory of Kashmir as a
seat of learning owing to political reasons is also a great factor
which stood in the way of the attraction of the aspiring students
from other states. Jayanta rose to prominence in his advanced
age in Kashmir. Before the adequate publicity of Jayanta's
master-piece 'Nyaya-mañjari' the sun of the glory of Kashmir
went down. Cultural vacuum in India was filled up by the
rise of the Prabhakaras and the Naiyãyikas around Mithila and
other seats of learning in the eastern zone in the later half of
the middle ages. The rise of the Jaina logicians in the western
zone is another factor which led to the isolation of Kashmirian
culture round about the same period. Jayanta was known to
Prabhacandra Sūri and Gangeśa Upådhyāya. The latter knew
him as jarannaiyāyika. Most probably he was not familiar
with his great work. Vacaspati Miśra and Udayana Acarya
became the focus of attention of all students of the Nyâya-
Vaisesika systems. Moreover, Jayanta was not a systematic
interpreter of the Nyaya-Sutra. He selected all the important
topics of Logic and defended the essential features of the
Realistic views of the Nyaya system to the best of his abilities.
He selected the right channel of defence and shattered all
barriers of the Idealists and the Poet-philosophers. His con-
tributions to Philosophy, Ethics, and Theology are of no mean
order. His catholicity in Religion even in the present day wins
the admiration of the religious reformers and thoughtful per-
sons, devoted to social service. It is undoubtedly the good
fortune of the twentieth century that the great work of Jayanta
was unearthed in the Southern India and was published by the
late Gangadhara Šāstrī. The discovery of the text of Nyaya-
mañjarī proves its excellence. It led to acceptance in the remo-(viii)
test seat of national culture of independent India. The politi-
cal turmoil is the predominant reason for its non-circulation in
the states of India which were cut off from Kashmir by
foreign invasion and internal feuds and constant political un-
est in the intervening countries.
Through the grace of God I have been able to present the
first volume of Nyaya-mañjarī which embodies the ways of
true knowledge of the Indian Logic to the enlightened socie-
ties of the East and the West through the medium of English.
This volume also comprises Epistemology and the fundamen-
tal elements of Theology and Religion. I completed my work
long ago and got it published in the Calcutta Review. During
the period of publication I could not read the proof-sheets
owing to my protracted illness. I depended upon the office-
staff for the correction of the published pages. I got them
retyped and sent them for publication. Bad health stood in
the way of revising the printed and retyped pages. Also I
have not been able to go through the proof-sheets of the present
volume myself owing to the want of prompt communication
for unavoidable reasons. I am sorry to state that I have notic-
ed a few errata and lacunas in the final stage since. I had to
depend solely upon a corrupt text. I have no opportunity of
getting them corrected at present. I take the sole responsibi-
lity on my own shoulders and lay the blame on no other doors
for these shortcomings. I have made up my mind to do justice
to the published work and to annex all corrections to the
second volume which will be published in the near future. I
simply beg the apology of the present readers for the adverse
circumstances which stand in the way of my prompt action to
rectify the book to the best of my abilities. To err is human
and as such I may crave the indulgence of the sagacions readers
for the same.
I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to my beloved
parents, teachers, friends and well-wishers whose constant
encouragement has given me impetus to complete my work.
My distinguished students and near ones have promised to help
me by their suggestions and constructive criticism. In antici-
pation I express my thanks to them. I invite criticism and
valuable suggestions from all sympathetic readers. I think that(ix )
it is a work of national importance which will help in the
future to raise the standard of research work both in India
and abroad.
I acknowledge my indebtedness to my late father, Pancha-
nana Tarkavagisa who had acted as pioneer to the translation
of Nyāyamañjarī in Bengali. He paved the way which I have
followed in English. He had to give up his work after making
some progress since his weak eyes could not bear the strain of
overexertion in his old age.
I express my thanks with gratitude to my publishers who
have encouraged me all along with ungrudging co-operation
and also to all my well-wishers.

915INTRODUCTION
Jayanta Bhaṭṭa is an obscure great scholar whom India may
be proud of. He is like the moon in the misty night of Decem-
ber. He has written the monumental work 'Nyaya-mañjari'.
Though it should have been widely studied and discussed yet
unfortunately it has not attracted the attention of Indian scho-
lars as much as it deserves to do. We shall not try to find out
the circumstances which were unfavourable to its study. We
thank our stars that such a precious book was discovered and
published by M. M. Gangadhara Śästrī towards the end of the
19th century A. D. In this introduction we shall not discuss so
much about the merits of Nyayamañjarī as about its author.
Abhinanda, son of Jayanta Bhaṭṭa, gave his pedigree in his
family in his introduction to Kādambari-katha-sára. We learn
from it that Jayanta Bhaṭṭa's remote ancestor Sakti migrated
to Kashmir from Bengal in the seventh century. He belonged
to the Bharadvāja family of the Gauda section of Brahmins.
The long journey undertaken by Sakti as described by Abhi-
nanda, suggests that Sakti most probably migrated from Bengal
to Kashmir. As he was a Gauḍa Brāhmaṇa the home of his
ancestors was Bengal. But it is difficult to say with absolute
certainty that Sakti migrated from Bengal. His grandson was
Sakti Svāmin. He was a minister of Muktāpīda, also known as
Lalitāditya. The great grand-son of Sakti Svåmin was Jayanta.
We also learn from Abhinanda that Jayanta was a poet of no
mean order and was also endowed with the gift of the gab. He
was well-versed in the Vedic lore and the different branches
of studies subordinate to the Vedas. Nay, he was well-acquaint-
ed with all the branches of the Šāstras. Nyaya-mañjarī was
composed by him, for its author acquired the title of Vṛttikära
(the writer of a commentary). This glorious title, conferred
upon him by a circle of scholars, points to the unqualified
merit of the work.
The date of Jayanta is not clearly stated in the Nyāya-
mañjari. Prof. A. B. Keith holds that Abhinanda composed the
synopsis of Kādambari in the ninth century A.D. He takes( xxiv )
pride in his father's title 'Vṛtti-kara'. This title suggests that
Nyāya-mañjari had been appreciated by the learned scholars
of his time. In other words, Nyâya-mañjari precedes Kådam-
barī-kathā-sara. If we accept the view of Dr. Keith, Nyāya-
manjarī was composed in the ninth century A.D. But Dr. Keith
has not elaborately discussed the problem of the date of
Abhinanda. So there is room for a doubt about its certainty.
Let us discuss the problem of Jayanta's date de novo.
There are some incidental personal references, in the Nyaya-
mañjarī of Jayanta, which throw some light on the age of its
author. Jayanta mentions the name of Samkaravarman, the
king of Kashmir.
Yadapūrvamiti viditvä nivårayāmāsa dharmatattvajñaḥ /
Rājā Šamkaravarmā na punar Jainādi-matamevam ||
(p. 248 N. M. Benares edition)
The king Samkaravarmā stopped some religious custom as
it had been unprecedented. Jayanta uses the verb in the past
perfect tense (lit). Does the verb 'nivãrayāmāsa' suggest
that Samkara varman had reigned long before Jayanta
was born? If it be so how is it that Jayanta's great grandfather
was contemporaneous with the king Lalitāditya ? The reign of
Muktāpīḍa extended over the period of thirty six years (from
733 A.D. to 769 A.D.) From this datum alone we are in a
position to infer the date of Jayanta. Jayanta must have been
born in the middle of the ninth century A.D.
Let us cite another verse from Nyāya-mañjarī, which will
help us to understand the meaning of the verb in the past per-
fect tense mentioned above.
Rājñâ tu gahvare 'sminnaśabdake bandhane vinihito 'ham /
Grantha-racanã-vinodādiha hi mayā vatsarā gamitāḥ //
(p.363 N. M. Banares edition)
Jayanta was imprisoned in a cave at the mandate of the king
of Kashmir. He utilised his dreary days. He took to the writ-
ing of Nyāya-mañjarī. Thus, he got a relief from the pain of
confinement. During the period of confinement the King
Šamkaravarman most probably put a ban on the Nilāmbara( xxv )
custom. Jayanta defends the action of the king as the said cus-
tom is immoral and not religious. The use of the verb in the
past perfect tense suggests the skill of Jayanta in introducing
bitter incidents without provoking the wrath of the then ruler.
Now the question 'Why was Jayanta imprisoned by the king
Samkaravarman?' arises in our mind. Jayanta remains silent
on this point. Kalhaṇa in his Rājatarangiņi furnishes us with a
clue. If we rightly grasp it then the reason behind Jayanta's
imprisonment becomes clear.
Dvijastayor nāyakākhyo Gaurīśa-sura-sadmanoḥ /
Caturvidyaḥ kṛtaṁ tena Vägdevikula-mandiram !!
(Rāja-tarangiņī 5/159)
Who is this Nayaka? Stein thinks that the rhetorician Bhaṭṭa
Nayaka has been referred to in this verse. There is no sound
reason at the back of this conjecture excepting the surname
"Nayaka' itself.
A rhetorician is not necessarily a Vedic scholar, Nayaka
"was not the name of the scholar. The title 'nãyaka' was most
probably converted into a name. Jayanta deserved the title
*Nayaka' in the fitness of things. In his versatile scholarship
erudition in the Vedic lore, oratory and skill in composing
*poems he was second to none. He was honoured by the king
who appointed him a teacher of the royal institute of learning
attached to the newly built temples of Siva. My revered father
the late Pandit Pañcanana Tarka-vägīša in his introduction to
"Nyaya-mañjarī rightly identified Nayaka with Jayanta. Thus,
Jayanta became the most exalted teacher in Kashmir during
the reign of Samkaravarman.
Now, let us see why Jayanta was imprisoned by the king
Samkaravarman, his very patron. Samkaravarman waged
wars of aggression abroad. He dissipated the resources of the
kingdom in these wars. But he achieved marked success no-
where. It became a problem to him to meet the expenses of his
vast army. He resorted to the oppressive system of taxation.
Moreover, he was very extravagant and was particular about
his personal comforts. He misappropriated the temple-treasures,
being a slave of greed and vices. Being always encircled by( xxvi)
en-
some base and evil self-seekers his mind was so obsessed by
their ill advice that he reduced the royal patronage till then
joyed by the men of learning. Jayanta was a man of independent
spirit. He was greatly devoted to the god Śiva. He was moral
to the back-bone. Jayanta might have lodged his protest against
the looting of the riches of temples. The arrogant king Sam-
karavarman could tolerate no just opposition. Jayanta was a
great stalwart. The opposition, led by him, had considerable-
weight. In order to put down this opposition Jayanta was im-
prisoned by the king. As the king was a terror to his subjects.
so Jayanta did not dare record the account of his imprisonment.
We refer to a few lines of Rajatarańgiņi in order to make our
readers familiar with the extortions of the king Samkaravarman
(Prajā-pidana-panditaḥ) (5/165) Devādināṁ sa sarvasvam
jahara yosad-yuktibhiḥ (5/166) Catuḥ şaşțim suragrhăn mumoșe-
taradañjasā (5/169) Nimittam maṇḍale' mușmin sa-vidyānām.
anādare ... Rājñām pratāpahānau ca nănyaḥ Šamkaravarma..
naḥ (5/179)... Anyaiśca vividhairyatnair vyadhäd grāmān sa nir-
dhanan (5/175). No king in Kashmir excelled the king Sam-
kara-varman in dishonouring men of letters in various ways.
Kalhana gives the story of oppression of the subjects and
that of dishonour shown to the learned men at the hands of the
said king in a nutshell. Does not the imprisonment of the
greatest scholar for defending a just cause illustrate the worst.
type of dishonour accorded to the learned society by the king?"
From the various suggestions scattered here and there we infer
that Jayanta was imprisoned in a cave during the reign of
Samkaravarman (883-902 A. D.)
Jayanta's Nyâya-mañjarī is full of copious references. A careful.
study of them may throw some light on his age. In this context.
the mention of the references to very early works is useless.
Jayanta refers to Kuṭṭanimatam, a work of the eighth century
A. D. The view of the Carvāka system as adumbrated in the
Tattva-upaplava-simha has been criticised by him. The name.
of the work is not known to Jayanta. The book was most pro-
bably written in the first half of the ninth century A. D. Jayanta
criticizes the view of Yukti-dipikā, a work of the 8th century.
He also quotes a verse from the first canto of Siśupala-vadha..
Magha belonged to the eighth century A. D. Abhinanda, in.( xxvii)
his Kadambari-katha-sära, mentions Jayanta Bhatta, his father
as the illustrious vṛttikära. This book was most probably written
in the second half of the ninth century A. D. We may roughly
calculate the age of Abhinanda on the basis of the genealogical
tree, mentioned by him.
We shall now discuss another important problem, viz. the
relation between Jayanta and Vacaspati Miśra. The pandit
Surya Narayana Sukla, in his introduction to Bheda-siddhi,
holds that Vacaspati Miśra was a pupil of Jayanta Bhatta. He
quotes a verse from Nyāya-kaņikā which is a commentary on
Vidhi-Viveka of Mandana Miśra. It runs thus :-
Ajñāna-timira-samanim
para-damanim Nyāya-mañjarīṁ rucirām /
Prasavitre prabhavitre
Vidyā-tarave namo gurave //
The very name 'Nyāya-mañjari' has tempted the pandit to
make a hasty conjecture. He has forgotten to take the date of
Nyâya-suci-nibandha into consideration. The working of the
date in this work is very ambiguous. We shall discuss the date
of Văcaspati afterwards. The same pandit, in the Nyaya-mañjari
edited by him holds that Vācaspati Miśra is earlier than
Jayanta. He equates 898 vatsara with 841 A. D. He also holds
that Jayanta refers to the view of Vācaspati Miśra. Jayanta
refers to the view of acarya. Who is this âcârya? Is he Vācas--
pati Miśra?
If we carefully analyse the view of Acarya then we fail to
identify Vacaspati Miśra with Acārya. Väcaspati, in his commen-
tary on Nyāya-värttika, has shown much originality. None of
his original views finds a place in Jayanta's Nyâya-mañjari.
Moreover, Jayanta is not a student of Vacaspati. Why should
he mention the name of Vacaspati? There is no proof that
Vācaspati was Jayanta's teacher. The epithet 'acãrya' does not
apply to him. Nyaya-mañjari, mentioned in the Nyaya-kanikā,
is a treatise on Mimamsã. The term 'Nyaya' is very popular in
the Mimāṁsā literature. Nyaya-mañjari signifies that it explains
all the Nyayas given in the Mimâmsã-sūtra. Therefore we
strongly assert that Vācaspatiwas not a pupil of Jayanta. Väcas-
pati himself mentions the name of Trilocana as his teacher in( xxviii )
the Nyāya-system. Trilocana has his original views on percep-
tion. Jayanta is absolutely innocent of these views. Moreover
in no work of Vacaspati is his acquaintance with the land of
Kashmir to be found. Väcaspati had no knowledge about reli-
gious toleration, the peculiar cult of Kashmir in the eighth and
the ninth centuries A. D. He was strictly conservative in his
out-look.
The date of Nyaya-sūci-nibandha, is Samvatsara, Prajñānā-
nanda Sarasvati holds the above view. According to this view
Vācaspati was a contemporary of Devapala who probably
reigned from 815 A. D. to 854. Vacaspati makes mention of a
great ruler 'Nrga'. Who is this Nṛga? Indian history throws no
light on such a ruler. How is it that an emperor has escaped
the notice of historians? Nrga is an epithet but is not the name
of a king. The Mahābhārata informs us of the great king Nrga.
Though the king performed many pious deeds yet he committ-
ed many sinful acts. From the above account we make out
that Vācaspati used it figuratively. He did not openly condemn
his royal patron. As he was very orthodox he could not justify
some acts of his patron. Devapāla was a Buddhist king. He
bestowed liberal grains on Buddhist monasteries. An inscription,
belonging to his reign, refers to a grant to a Buddhist monastery
built by a king of Java and Sumatra. The king's attachment to
Buddhism displeased Vacaspati who neither suppressed his
feeling nor clearly expressed it. He gave vent to his inner feeling
in a subtle manner. Thus we see that Väcaspati was a senior
contemporary of Jayanta. If we carefully examine the reference,
contained in the Nyāya-mañjarī of Jayanta, we learn that Jaya-
nta did not know much of his senior contemporary philosophers
of distant lands: Jayanta was thoroughly conversant with the
earlier views. At his time the communication of current thou-
ghts was not easy. Avantivarman restored peace at home and
became a great patron of learning. At this period Jayanta was
a learner. He had to read the old classical works of the different
branches of Sanskrit learning. He became a sound scholar when
a civil war broke out in Kashmir. Kashmir which was previously
a place of attraction for the men of letters belonging to the
different parts of India, being a renowned seat of culture sud-
denly turned out to be a field of military action-a beloved place( xxix )
for warriors. The atmosphere of Kashmir became too hot for
the advancement of learning. The import of new ideas into
this land was suddenly stopped. Thus, Jayanta had no oppor-
tunity of being acquainted with the current thoughts of other
parts of India. After this civil war Śarıkaravarman ascended
the throne of Kashmir. Jayanta rose to prominence. But fortune
did not favour him for a long time. A sudden reversal of fate
took place. He was imprisoned in a cell. He was cut off from
the surrounding world. He became confined in the circle of his
ideas. He found out some tragic relief in composing a work on
the Nyaya-system of thought. The period of his imprisonment
was indefinite. He found ample leisure to bestow his best
thoughts on his composition. He repeatedly pondered over the
problems he discussed. He dived deep into the matter and tried
to reach the very bottom of every item. The wealth of know-
ledge and mental alertness which he possessed won for him a
place in the forefront of Indian philosophy.
Some scholars hold that Jayanta flourished during the reign.
of Partha or that of Pangu. The verse" .... nivārayāmāsa ..
Rājā Šamkaravarmā” is the hinge upon which all their argu-
ments hang. The use of the verb in the past perfect tense-
think that Jayanta must be
(nivārayāmāsa) leads them to
posterior to Samkaravarman with whom he had no personal
acquaintance. The events of the said king could not come with-
in the circle of Jayanta's experience. These scholars have missed
the sense of the past perfect tense. A person may use a verb in the
past perfect tense to denote such events as happened in a distant
country or at a period of time which is beyond the range of his
sense-organs. The use of past perfect does not necessarily imply
that it refers only to such an event as falls outside the life history
of the person who uses the verb. Moreover, there is no reliable
record in the history of Kashmir that the reign of the said king
was notorious for the persecution of men of letters. Again, we
know the genealogical table of Jayanta. If we calculate the age
of Jayanta on the basis of the said table then we arrive at the
conclusion that Jayanta was born during the reign of Avanti-
varman. Hence we can confidently say that Jayanta was con-
temporaneous with Śamkaravarman.
Prof. Macdonell and some Indian Pandits place Văcaspati( XXX )
Miśra in the twelfth century A. D. Their calculation of the age
of Miśra has been wrong because they have wrongly identified
the senior Vacaspati Miśra with the junior Vacaspati Miśra.
The junior Vācaspati Miśra is better known as abhinava Vācas-
pati Miśra. He is the author of Khaṇḍanoddhāra a work con-
taining the refutation of Khaṇḍana-Khaṇḍa-khadya of Śrīharşa
from the Nyāya standpoint. But they do not see how it is possi-
ble that Udayana writes a commentary upon Vâcaspati's work.
The late Pandit Vindhyesvari Prasada Dvivedi holds that
Vacaspati Miśra flourished during the reign of the king Nrga
in the tenth century A.D. He equates the Vatsara, mentioned
by Vacaspati Miśra with the Saka era. In that case he be-
-comes a contemporary of Udayana. He has little opportunity
of writing a commentary on the Nyāya-Vārttika-tātparya of
Vacaspati Miśra. When an earlier commentary is roughly
handled by the critics, the posterior generation of the same
school finds the necessity of defending the views of their
teacher. An able disciple of the school writes a commentary
upon the previous commentary. It is a general rule that there
is a long interval of time between a commentary and its sub-com-
mentary if the second commentary is not written by the direct
disciple of the author of the former one. We can strongly
assert that Udayana was not a disciple of Vācaspati. In the
Bhāmati commentary of Vácaspati there is a reference to a
sovereign ruler. His resources and prestige lie beyond the
reach of imagination of the other kings. If Nrga is the king
how is it that there is no trace of him in the history of India. No-
body knows the existence of the king Nrga in the tenth century
A.D. We appreciate the creation of the pure imagination of
Vindhyesvari Prasada but cannot rely upon its contribution. We
have already pointed out that the king Nrga is Devapāla. Thus
we cannot accept the hypothesis of Vindhyesvari Prasada.
According to our hypothesis Vācaspati Miśra is a senior con-
temporary of Jayanta Bhaṭṭa; the Nyāya-vārttika-tātparya of
Vacaspati has not been referred to in the Nyāya-mañjari and
Jayanta is absolutely innocent of Vacaspati. Gangesa in his
Tattva-cintamaṇi (upamāna-khaṇḍa) has mentioned the name
of Jayanta as qualified by the epithet 'jaran Naiyāyika' (an
old logician). We cannot infer the age of Jayanta from this( xxxi }
epithet as Gangesa's knowledge of the chronological order is
not dependable.
The main task, undertaken by Jayanta, is to defend the
views of Vatsyāyana expressed in the Nyaya-bhāṣya against the
criticisms offered by the rival schools. He is a sincere and
devoted student of the Bhäṣya school. Though the Buddhists are
the worst enemies of Vätsyāyana yet Bhartṛhari, Kumârila,
Prabhākara Rāja and others are no less formidable opponents.
Jayanta wields his pen to give an answer to the charges brought
forward by the critics of Vätsyāyana. He also subjects the
rival hypothesis to severe criticism. At the time of explaining
the views of his master he also introduces new matter into his
work. His style of writing is inimitable. His language is
forceful. His selection of words is very happy. Even when the
discussion of a topic is very long, the presentation of the subject
does not appear to be insipid to the readers. He does not at
the same time sacrifice accuracy at the altar of his artistic
expression. His analysis is very minute. He does not engage
himself in logic-chopping He focusses his attention upon the
subject matter. His mind is broad and fair. He appreciates
the merit of the arguments of his opponent if they are sound.
He does not condemn anything and everything which comes
from the pen of his opponents. He is also very bold in his
statement. He spares nobody however great he may be. He
does not hesitate to be out-spoken He fearlessly declares that
Prabhākara has borrowed such and such part of his thesis from
the Buddhists without acknowledgment. Therefore, Prabha-
kara is a plagiarist. Sometimes the caustic remarks, flung
upon his masterly opponents, go beyond the bounds of decorum.
Sometimes he overdoes and loses the balance of judgment.
Though Jayanta is very cautious in the choice of words yet
he being influenced upon by the style of writing of the earlier
writers, unwittingly heaps contumely upon the great opponents
of the Nyaya school. His self-restraint in the tempting places
might have been much more appreciated. The use of harsh
words or that of abusive language does not display the great-
_ness of one's mind. Modesty in every sphere of life is praise-
worthy. The language of the Buddhist critics is very bitter
and pungent. These critics have no respect for the great( xxxii)
teachers of the Nyaya school. Though the sarcastic remarks
might have provoked the pious wrath of Jayanta yet he should
have restrained himself and dressed his arguments and remarks.
in polite language.
Jayanta is a sound scholar. He has studied several branches:
of learning. He has had no scruples to go through the text-
books on Buddhist Logic. Though he holds a very poor
opinion about the narrow outlook of the Cārvākas yet he pays.
close attention to the proper understanding of their system..
His knowledge of the Mimamsa school is very comprehensive.
He is thoroughly acquained with the two broad divisions of the
Mimāṁsā school, viz. the Bhāṭṭa and Prābhākara schools. He is.
also aware of the nice shades of difference in views among the
followers of these two schools. He mentions the views of
Bhartṛmitra and those of the modern logicians of the Prabhā--
kara school. He has studied all the recondite works on Pāņini's.
grammar, viz. the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali, the Vākyapadiya
of Bhartrhari, etc. The Naiyáyikas do not generally read the-
Vedic scriptures specially the Atharva Veda. Jayanta is a
sound Vedic scholar. His study of Vedic literature is very
extensive. That is why Jayanta is in a position to review the-
hypothesis of the Mimāṁsakas with apt reference to the Vedic
texts. It is also superfluous to add that he intimately knows
all the details of the Nyaya school. In other words, he is like-
a moving library. It is for this reason that he was able to.
complete his voluminous Nyāya-mañjari when he had been
cut off from the external world, being imprisoned in a cell.
He received no help from outside. He had no books to-
consult. He had to depend absolutely upon his memory and
scholarship. It is a wonderful feat which has seldom any
parallel in history. The authors of the modern age receive
all facilities i.e. they are supplied with the books they require
while they write books behind the prison bar. We shall do.
injustice to Nyāya-mañjarī if we simply take it to be a commen-
tary. It is an encyclopedia of logic, metaphysics, ethics and
theology. It represents the history of Indian philosophy of a few
centuries. If an author of the history of Indian Philosophy is
not acquainted with Nyaya-mañjarī then his work will remain.
incomplete for ever. His data will not be sufficiently collected..(xxxiii)
Besides the resourcefulness of Nyāyamañjarī it contributes
much towards the infusion of catholic spirit into Indian cul-
ture. Jayanta has grasped the essence of true religion and ex-
pressed it in clear and convincing terms.
Jayanta mentions the six schools of logic, viz., the Nyāya
school, the Samkhya school, the Buddhist school, the Jaina
school, the Cärvāka school and the Vaiseșika school (asyam
janatāsu prasiddhāyāmapi ṣaṭtarkyam). This remark will throw
some light on those who will write the history of Indian Logic.
It is interesting to note the ancient scholars did not recognise
that the logic of memory always refers to such a content as is
contradicted by our sound experience. Therefore, memory per se
is incorrect. The hypothesis of memory, suggested by Jayanta,
has not been accepted universally.
Jayanta has also criticised the pragmatic test of true know-
ledge. The knowledge of an object which successfully leads the
knower up to the object or helps him to avoid it is true.
The Buddhists say that the determinate perception, being
constructed by imagination, is not true. But it cannot
lead one up to the object in question because it is short-lived.
The fundamental doctrine of the universal flux itself contradicts
the definition of true knowlelge as offered by the Buddhists. From
the standpoint of the Buddhists there is only a logical distinc-
tion between Pramå and Pramâņa as they are the two aspects
of one and the same phenomenon of consciousness. Jayanta has
refuted this hypothesis.
Jayanta subjects the hypothesis of Pramana as suggested by
the Samkhyists to severe criticism. According, to them the mode
of intellect (Buddhi) which assumes the form of an object
is Pramāṇa. Jayanta boldly asserts that this hypothesis is closely
akin to that of the Buddhists. He does not pay much importance
to this hypothesis since the hypothesis of the Buddhists has been
repudiated by him. In this context he has also proved that
novelty is not the criterion of true knowledge.
He has elaborately discussed the division and the definition
of Pramaņa. He refers to the different views regarding the
division of Pramāņa. His criticism is mainly directed against
the Buddhists. He subjects the twofold division of true knowledge
as offered by the Buddhists to severe criticism. The Buddhists1/
( xxxiv)
hold that there are only two kinds of objects, viz. (1) exclusively
particular reals and (2) concepts manufactured and objectivized
by our imagination. They also hold that this division of objects is
based upon experience. We learn from our perception that this
is a blue object, that this is not a non-blue object and that
there is no other kind of object. Jayanta challenges the very
evidence of perception and points out that perception can only
reveal a present object but can do nothing more.
In this way Jayanta proceeds to do justice to the hypothesis
of the Naiyayikas. Having established the fourfold division of
Pramâņa, he does not spare the hypotheses of the Bhāṭṭas and
the Prabhākaras. He tries his level best to prove that presump-
tion is not a distinct source of knowledge. He holds that presump-
tion cannot be distinguished from inference. He also holds that
a distinct source of knowledge is not to be postulated to know
negation. Negation is perceived. It may also be inferred in
some cases.
In this connection he has tried his best to establish the hypo-
thesis that negation is objectively real. He mentions the two-
fold division of negation, viz. pre-negation and post-negation.
The negation of an object which will come into being is called
pre-negation. The negation of an object which has ceased to
exist is called post-negation. The classical fourfold division as
suggested by the Vaiseșikas has been ignored by him. He tries
to explain all kinds of negation in terms of the two types of
negation. He follows the foot-step of the Nyâya-Bhāṣya-kara. But
his explanation is not satisfactory since he misses the funda-
mental difference holding between the negation of identity and
that of relation. Moreover, the eternal negation of an object in
its relational character cannot be translated in terms of pre-
negation.
Jayanta exhibits all his scholarship to solve the problem of
perception. He makes mention of a good number of views of
the long forgotten logicians. He fairly discusses these views. In
spite of his wide scholarship he fails to touch the centre of the
problem of perception. Does our knowledge begin with a judg-
ment? Is the indeterminate perception of the Nyaya School a
judgment? Is it a feeling or a form of consciousness? Does the
criterion of truth apply to it? Wherein lies the difference be--1
( xxxv )
tween the normal and the super-normal perception? Does super-
normal perception come under the province of perception?
Jayanta's idea of super-normal perception is not very clear.
Moreover, Jayanta avoids some problems which he should have
tackled with a firm hand. How are we aware of the awareness
of an object? The causal theory of perception implies that the
object which conditions its own perception should be present
at the time of its perception. The phenomenon of consciousness
very short-lived. It lasts only for two kṣaṇas. Again, the de-
terminate perception of an object is preceded by its indeter-
minate perception. If these two conditions of perception are
taken to be essential then the intuition of an awareness becomes
a problem.
Jayanta discusses the problem of inference from the standpoint
of the old logicians. His contribution to the solution of the prob-
lem of inference is mainly the destructive criticism of the Bud-
dhist hypothesis. The Buddhists hold that in order to arrive at a
generalization one is to depend upon the relation of identity or
that of causality. Jayanta strongly refutes this view. He also
establishes the truth of inferential knowledge. One of the (pur-
poses) of inference is to prove that the transcendental objects
are rightly inferred. Jayanta plays his part well in order to bring
home the point in question. But the problem of induction in-
volves a few basic problems which are for empiricism hardnuts
to crack. Jayanta does not raise them. Is induction at all possible
from the empirical point of view? Jayanta anyhow solves this
problem. He does not dive deep into the matter. He has also
failed to work out the suggestions of the Nyaya-Värttika-kāra. He
thinks that his task will be completed if he defends the Nyâya-
Bhāṣya-kāra against the attacks raised by the hostile camps.
Jayanta's treatment of Upamāna is fairly long. Gangesa re-
fers to his view. The hypothesis of comparison as offered by
the Mimāṁsakas has been admirably refuted by Jayanta. He
has proved that Upamāna is a distinct source of knowledge but
not an inference. Upamāna is not a piece of indirect knowledge
based upon analogy. But it is the ascertainment of the meaning
of an unknown word based upon analogy.
Jayanta with right earnestness tries to establish the hypo-
thesis of the Naiyãyikas that Śabda is a distinct source of know-( xxxvi )
ledge. The knowledge, derived from the sentence of a trust-
worthy person, is true. Though it is indirect yet it is not
inferential. He refutes the view that verbal knowledge is an
inference. He meets the objection of the Buddhists who hold
that verbal knowledge per se is not true. In order to prove the
thesis of the Naiyãyikas that the truth of the Vedas is not self-
evident he raises the fundamental problem, viz. whether or not
the truth of knowledge is self-evident. He also discusses the
other aspects of the problem, viz. whether or not the factors to
which a piece of knowledge owes its origin are responsible for
its truth. After having discussed all the rival views he arrives
at the conclusion that the truth of a piece of knowledge is not
self-evident. A factor in addition to the recognised factors of a
piece of knowledge is required to bring about a piece of true
knowledge. The Vedas are not also immune from this general
rule. In this context Jayanta has also discussed some of the
well-known theories of illusion. He has established the Nyâya
view of illusion, viz. a mistake consists in misinterpreting a thing.
When one cannot read an object in the right context he wrong-
ly places it and commits a mistake. Therefore a true or false
knowledge implies that it is necessarily a judgment. Even if a
judgment is false it contains a reference to a real object. The
Naiyāyikas assume that there is no contradiction in Nature.
Truth or falsehood applies only to a judgment. Jayanta shares
the same view with them. He incidentally refers to the hypo-
thesis of illusion of a section of the Mimāṁsakas whose thesis
bears a close resemblance to that of the Advaitins. If we can
ascertain the exact date of these Mimamsakas then a flood of
new light will be shed on the history of Indian Philosophy.
Jayanta enters into controversy with the Mīmāṁsakas, re-
garding the character of sound. He closely examines the hypo-
thesis of the Mimamsakas that sound is eternal and arrives at the
conclusion that sound is non-eternal. He also holds that it is
an attribute of the sky. The other topics of Nyaya-mañjarī will
be discussed later on in proper places. We simply reiterate our
honest opinion about Jayanta that he is a devoted student of
the Nyaya-Bhâşya-school, having abilities of no mean order.
