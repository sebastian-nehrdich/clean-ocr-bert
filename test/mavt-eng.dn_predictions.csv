for Hannah and EllieABSTRACT	1
This work contains two main components: (a) an English translation of the	1
Sanskrit texts comprising the Buddhist Yogācāra philosophical work known as the	1
Madhyāntavibhaga. It includes the verses (kārikā) of Maitreya/Asanga, commentary	1
(bhāşya) of Vasubandhu and sub-commentary (fika) of Sthiramati. (b) Text critical	1
remarks for the establishment of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's commentary based	1
upon: (i) a photographed copy of the original manuscript, (ii) the Edited Sanskrit text	1
prepared by S. Yamaguchi and (iii) the Peking and Derge (sde dge) editions of the	1
canonical blockprints of the Tibetan bsTan hgyur.	1
The Madhyāntavibhāga contains an exposition of the analysis (vibhāga) of the	1
middle way (madhya) in relation to the various extreme views (anta). It is arranged in	1
"five chapters: The first chapter, ""the defining characteristics"" (lakšaņa) provides a"	1
detailed account of both the nature of the phenomenal world and the way that it is	1
imaginatively constructed (parikalpyate) in consciousness, as well as the Yogācāra	1
understanding of emptiness (śünyata). Chapter two identifies the main obscurations	1
(avaraṇa) to enlightenment for the śravaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.	1
Chapter three provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva) and their intrinsic	1
relationship with the three natures (svabhāva), i.e the imaginary (parikalpita), the other-	1
dependent (paratantra) and the perfected (parinişpanna). Chapter four is concerned	1
with the development of meditative practices (bhāvanā), the various states (avasthā) of	1
the latter and the results (phala) obtained from those states. Chapter Five extols the	1
virtues of the universal vehicle (mahāyāna) in comparison to the other vehicles	1
especially in regard to spiritual practice (pratipatti), objective support (ālambana) and	1
full attainment (samudāgama).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS	1
I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the people who, in various ways,	1
made this study possible. Firstly, I wish to thank Professor J. W. de Jong for his	1
guidance both during my early years as a student of the Sanskrit language and literature	1
and in the preparation of this work. Without the benefit of his scholarly expertise and	1
learning the completed work would certainly have been of a much lower standard. I	1
must also thank my co-supervisor, Dr. Tissa Rajapatirana, whose infinite patience and	1
skills as a teacher of the Sanskrit and Tibetan languages made it possible for me to	1
embark upon this project. This work has also benefitted immensely from his	1
corrections and suggested changes made after reading through the entire work in its	1
final stages.	1
I am also in debt to my friend Dr. Michael Comans with whom, as a fellow Ph.D.	1
student at the A.N.U., I had the good fortune to share an office for three years.	1
Michael's discipline and dedication to his task is an inspiration to all who work with	1
him. To Peter Oldmeadow, a true kalyāṇamitra and fellow Ph.D. student, I owe much	1
for having sparked my initial interest in Indian Religions especially in regard to the	1
theory and practice of Buddhism. The value of our discussions on the subject over the	1
years has been immense.	1
Thanks are also due to the other members of the South and West Asia Centre: Dr.	1
Luise Hercus, Dr. Richard Barz and Mr. Yogendra Yadav for their friendship and	1
help. Special thanks are due to the Secretary of the Centre Miss Betty Kat whose good	1
humour, abundant energy and willingness to be of assistance have eased the difficulties	1
on countless occasions.	1
I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Gadjin M. Nagao who kindly	1
provided me with photocopies of the actual manuscript of the Tika used by Susumu	1
Yamaguchi in the preparation of his Sanskrit Edition. Thanks are due to Dr. Johannes	1
Bronkhorst of the Kern Institute who generously provided advice concerning the	1
proper interpretation of a Sanskrit grammatical term used by Sthiramati. I must	1
acknowledge the help of Professor Michael Hahn who first suggested that I enquire of	1
the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project on the expectation that the original	1
manuscript of the Madhyāntavibhāga-ṭīkā may have been re-discovered there and 1	1
must also express my gratitude to Dr. Horst Brinkhaus of the Nepal-German	0
Manuscript Preservation Project who supervised the copying process and ensured that	1
the copy was despatched to Australia without undue delay.vi	1
I am indebted to Professor Monika Theil-Horstmann and Dr. Akira Saito for their	1
generous assistance in the translation of some articles in the German and Japanese	1
languages, respectively, which were essential to my research. Thanks are due also to	1
Mr. Yasuo Tsukada for material support given in the true spirit of dāna.	1
Finally, I wish to thank the Faculty of Asian Studies for the excellent facilities and	1
opportunity to carry out this research.Contents	1

Introduction	1
There are three main reasons for this neglect: (a) The MAV- Tīkä stands virtually	1
alone as a broad ranging account of early Yogãcãra thought; consequently it is often	1
not possible to seek help from other parallel texts for a proper understanding of some	1
of its more complex passages. The Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra (MSA) is closely related	1
to the MAV and a study of Sthiramati's commentary will undoubtedly shed more light	1
on the MAV; however, the MSA reflects a more practice oriented doctrine and many	1
of its ideas are generally at an earlier stage of development. There are other shorter	1
works in existence that obviously share common doctrinal elements with the MAV,	1
such as the Dharmadharmatavibhāga and Vasubandhu's Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi;	1
however, these works are relevant only to specific aspects of the early Yogācāra and	1
The Madhyântavibhāga (MAV) contains a comprehensive and detailed account of	0
the philosophical thought of the Yogācāra school of Mahāyāna Buddhism at an early	1
stage of its development. As a systematic exposition of the Mahayana from the	1
perspective of the early Yogācāra it is unique; thus its understanding is fundamental to	1
a proper appreciation of Yogācāra thought.	1
In the Indian Yogacara tradition the MAV comprises three essential works: (a) the	1
Kārikā text attributed to Maitreya / Asanga, (b) Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya and (c) the Țīkā	1
of Sthiramati. Considering that all three of these works have been available for more	1
than fifty years it is remarkable that they have not been comprehensively studied to-	1
date. The French translation and annotation of the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi by Louis de	1
La Vallée Poussin in 1928-292 remains the most authoritative study of the Yogācāra-	1
vijñaptimātra doctrine. However, this work is not representative of the Yogācāra as a	1
whole but is heavily influenced by Dharmapala's interpretation of the thought of	1
Maitreya and Vasubandhu and has fundamental differences from Sthiramati's	1
interpretations as contained in the MAV-Tīka³. Apart from a flurry of scholarly	1
activity that coincided with the publication of the Sanskrit Editions of Sthiramati's	1
Tika in the early 1930's and Vasubandhu's Bhaṣya5 in the 1960's, the MAV has	1
received only piecemeal attention.	1
Commonly known also as the vijñānavāda.	1

are themselves in need of further study. (b) An additional hindrance to the study of	0
this school lies in the fact that the precise meaning of many of the words and concepts	1
employed by Sthiramati is often of quite an enigmatic nature. This is due partly to his	1
terse commentarial style but also because the reader's familiarity with many of the	1
subjects discussed is assumed and no attempt is made at further clarification. In	1
addition, when presenting the alternative views held by other schools Sthiramati never	1
identifies the particular school intended; presumably because this is also assumed to be	1
common knowledge. (c) The third factor that has had an inhibiting influence on the	1
study of the MAV is the quality of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's Tīkä edited and	1
published by S. Yamaguchi. The manuscript used by Yamaguchi was hand-copied	1
from a badly damaged original, a large portion of which was reconstructed with the	1
help of the Tibetan translations. Since it is often impossible to recast much more than	1
the known technical terms from the Tibetan into Sanskrit with any certainty, such an	1
enterprise is never entirely satisfactory and this edition stands in need of improvement.	1
It was the French scholar Sylvain Lévi who first discovered the Sanskrit	1
manuscript of the MAV-Tīka in Nepal in 1928 and arranged to have a copy prepared	1
by hand. Inevitably scribal errors were incorporated during the copying process. As	1
mentioned above, the original manuscript was incomplete with approximately one third	1
of all the folios missing on the left-hand side. The copied manuscript was then	1
entrusted to Susumu Yamaguchi who prepared a Sanskrit edition, the first two	1
chapters of which were published over the next couple of years in various issues of	1
Otani Gakuhō6. Meanwhile, the MAV-Țikã was discovered for a second time in	1
Nepal by Guiseppe Tucci, who, with the help of Vidhusekhara Bhaṭṭācārya, also	1
engaged in the preparation of a Sanskrit edition. Although originally intending to edit	1
and reconstruct the missing portions of the entire text, they eventually published only	1
the first chapter in 19327. This is a work of good quality (in devanagarī script) and the	1
reconstructed sentences are sometimes preferable to those of Yamaguchi's edition. In	1
1934 S. Yamaguchi published an edition of the complete Sanskrit text in five chapters	1
(in Romanised form) which includes the portions recast from the Tibetan. Although	1
this edition of the MAV-ȚIka has many shortcomings, it must be regarded as a	1
significant and valuable scholarly achievement; this edition is used as the basis of the	1
present study.	1

The MAV-Bhäşya then became the focus of scholarly attention with the	1
publication in 1937 of S. Yamaguchi's edition of Vasubandhu's Bhasya which	1
included the Tibetan translation and the Chinese translations of Hsüan-tsang and	1
Paramärtha¹3. In 1953-54 P.W. O'Brien published an English translation of the third	1
chapter of the Bhāṣya in two issues of Monumenta Nipponica¹4. This is a very	1
thorough and readable work based on the Tibetan and Chinese translations and	1
includes abundant references to Sthiramati's Tika (Yamaguchi's ed.) and also to the	1
LVP Kośa and Siddhi. An important contribution to the study of the MAV was made	1
in 1964 when Gadjin M. Nagao published a Sanskrit (Romanised) edition of	1
Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya which incorporates the Karikā text¹5. It was epared from a	1
manuscript discovered in the Ngor Monastery in Tibet by Rahula Sanskrityāyana in	1
1934 and is an exceptionally fine work requiring only a few minor corrections. The	1
publication of this edition now made it possible to revise Yamaguchi's edition of the	1
Tīkä since the latter contains many quotations from the Bhäsya that were reconstructed	1
A Japanese translation of the MAV-Tika was published by S. Yamaguchi in	0
The following year the great Russian scholar of Buddhism Theodore	0
Stcherbatsky published an English translation of just the first chapter of the MA V-	1
Tika. This work which includes a translation of Vasubandhu's Bhãşya from the	1
Tibetan is based on the Tucci and Bhaṭṭācārya edition of the Tika as well as the Tibetan	1
translation. As far as the translation is concerned, it is not a very useful work since it	1
suffers both from Stcherbatsky's somewhat florid and free style as well his many	1
philosophical misconceptions regarding the Yogacara doctrine. However, his text-	1
critical remarks and annotations where he often provides a more literal translation are	1
quite valuable; many are difficult to improve upon and are incorporated in the present	1
study. At the same time that Stcherbatsky was preparing his translation, the Dutch	1
scholar David Friedmann was also translating the first chapter of the Tikå based on	1
Yamaguchi's edition. When he discovered that the Russian scholar was translating the	1
same work, Friedmann almost abandoned his translation but fortunately was persuaded	1
by Stcherbatsky himself to complete his study¹2. The result is a good translation,	1
generally superior to that of Stcherbatsky's and well annotated particularly through its	1
references to the LVP Kośa and Siddhi; however, no attempt has been made to rectify	1
the Sanskrit textual problems.	1

the Bhāṣya¹6 and a translation of the whole Bhāṣya in 1976?17 Another edition of the	1
Sanskrit Bhäşya was published in 1967 by Nathmal Tatia and Anantalal Thakur ¹8.	1
An attempt was made to improve upon Yamaguchi's edition of the Tīkā by the	1
Indian scholar Ramachandra Pandeya who published a revised edition in 197119	1
incorporating the Bhãşya and Kärikā text. In the introduction to this work Pandeya	1
claims that his corrections to Yamaguchi's edition are made on the basis of the Tibetan	1
translation (Peking Ed.). Pandeya's edition was reviewed by J.W. de Jong20 who	1
demonstrated that in many instances his emendations appear to be made quite	1
arbitrarily without recourse to the Tibetan text and for this reason Pandeya's edition has	1
not been consulted in the present study. In his review, de Jong resolves many of the	1
textual problems of the second chapter of the Țikä.	1
In 1982 Thomas A. Kochumuttom published a study of the essential doctrines	1
from the works of Vasubandhu21 which includes an English translation of the first	1
chapter of the MAV-Bhāṣya as well as selected parts of the Tika. Although his	1
translation of the Bhãṣya is generally quite accurate, his translation of the Țika	1
passages (upon which much of his interpretative comment depends) is based on	1
Pandeya's edition which, as we have seen, is not completely reliable. It should be	1
noted that Kochumuttom's understanding of the philosophy of Vasubandhu is	1
controversial for he argues that it is open to interpretation as a system that embraces	1
"""realistic pluralism"". An English translation of the whole MAV-Bhāṣya was included"	1
in a publication by Stephan Anacker in 198422. This is an unsatisfactory work which	1
abounds with errors and misunderstandings 23	1
When my own project was first conceived it was envisaged to have three main	1
components: (a) A translation of the Karika, Bhãşya and Tīkā texts based on Nagao's	1
and Yamaguchi's respective editions. (b) Text-critical annotations to the Yamaguchi	1
edition of the Tika with the help of the Sanskrit Bhāṣya and versions of the	1
Tibetan translation, i.e. the Derge (sde dge) and Peking editions, with the aim of	1
making a significant contribution towards the establishment of a more reliable Sanskrit	1

Tīkā text. (c) Time permitting, I also hoped to produce a preliminary exegesis of the	0
work.	1
Several months after beginning my study I was fortunate enough to discuss my	1
research with Professor M. Hahn of the Indologisches Seminar of the University of	1
Bonn who was visiting the A.N.U. at the time. Following his suggestion I contacted	1
the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project in Kathmandu, Nepal, on the	1
chance that the original manuscript of the MAV-Tīkā were listed among their records.	1
As it turned out, this was in fact the case the Tīkä had indeed been discovered for a	1
third time and was catalogued and microfilmed in 1970 by that organization. Many	1
months later I managed to secure a copy of the manuscript which was photographed	1
from the microfilmed copy. The script of the manuscript is clearly a variety of Nevari	1
and the reproduction is generally of a very high quality, most characters being quite	1
legible as can be seen from the samples shown in Appendix I. It soon became obvious	1
that it was the very manuscript found by Lévi and Tucci more than fifty years earlier	1
although a little worse for wear. When compared with Yamaguchi's edition, the	1
lacunae coincide almost exactly; the only differences being caused by further	1
deterioration along the damaged side of some folios where up to ten characters may be	1
lost. The first folio (1b) is in a particularly bad state with only a small fragment that	1
can be read with certainty. Also, two folios are completely absent (31b and 32a	1
equivalent to Y105.15 to 106.27). The microfilm is kept in the National Archives,	1
Kathmandu, Nepal, and the details found on the title page are as follows: Manuscript	1
No. 5 233 vi bauddhadarśana 66; Catalogue: brhat samkşipta sūcipatram; Title:	1
Madhyāntavibhaga-kārikā; No. of leaves: 85; Size: 56 x 5.5 cm.; Date of filming:	1
22.9.70; Remarks: palm-leaf - half of the foll. very badly damaged; Reel No. A38/10.	1
The re-discovery of the original manuscript of the MAV-Țīkâ has thus made it	1
possible to include new material in this study, material that is particularly relevant to the	1
establishment of the Sanskrit text. By comparing the original manuscript with the	1
Yamaguchi edition it has been possible to detect and rectify many mis-readings and	1
scribal errors that were incorporated into the Yamaguchi edition. This aspect of my	1
work has been further complemented through the acquisition of a photo-copy of the	1
actual manuscript used by Yamaguchi which was kindly supplied by Prof. G.M.	1
Nagao.	1
As my research progressed it became apparent that there would not be time to carry	1
out the third component originally envisaged, i.e. the exegesis of the text; rather, the	1
completed study would be restricted to the translation and textual emendations. In	1
addition to the textual problems encountered in the Sanskrit Tīkā, the Tibetan	1
translation is also quite corrupt in many places, thus compounding the difficulties in	1
establishing the Sanskrit. Although I am now reasonably satisfied that the majority of	1
the textual problems have been resolved, the completed work cannot not be regarded as1.	1
definitive or conclusive. The MAV-Tīkā will no doubt yield greater coherence to	1
future scholars and many of its more enigmatic passages will be translated with more	1
certainty only after the writings of Sthiramati are understood in greater depth. Suffice	1
it to say that, although there is considerable scope for improvement through future	1
research, is intended that this study may serve as the basis for a critical edition of the	1
Sanskrit text of the Tika and that the translation will be of value to those seeking a	1
proper understanding of the philosophy and doctrine of the early Yogācāra.	1

Synopsis of the Madhyāntavibhāga.	1
As its title suggests, the central theme of the Madhyāntavibhāga is the analysis	1
(vibhāga) of the traditional Buddhist concept of the Middle Way (madhya) in relation	1
to the various extreme views (anta) recast to accomodate the spiritual perspective of the	1
Yogācāra. The extremes are normally identified as belonging to two essential	1
categories, i.e. as the extreme views which lead to imputation (samāropa) or negationxviii	1
(apavāda) in regard to the existence (bhava) of phenomena in contrast to the way that	1
they are to be understood in reality. The MAV is arranged in five chapters which deal	1
with seven main subjects: (a) the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa), (b) the obscurations	1
(āvaraṇa), (c) the realities (tattva), (d) the meditative development of counteragents	1
(pratipakṣa-bhāvanā), (e) the various states (avasthā) in the latter, (f) the attainment of	1
results (phala-präpti) and (g) the supremacy of the [universal] vehicle (yānānuttarya).	1
Each chapter concludes with an abridged summary (piņdārtha) of contents which,	1
according to Sthiramati24, is included to enable the student to easily remember both the	1
contents and sequential order of the subjects explained.	1
The first chapter, which is possibly the most complex of the five, provides a	1
detailed account of the essential philosophy of this school. The chapter is divided into	1
two parts: the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of: (a) the imagination of what is unreal	1
(abhūta-parikalpa) and (b) emptiness (śūnyatā). Part (a) explores both the nature of the	1
phenomenal world which is understood in essence as unreal (abhūta), and the way in	1
which it comes into being or is imaginatively constructed (parikalpa). This part is	1
divided into nine sections which include explanations of the three natures (tri-	1
svabhāva), the dynamics of the actualizing consciousnesses (pravṛtti-vijñānāni) and an	1
extremely detailed re-interpretation of the theory of dependent origination (pratitya-	1
samutpāda) according to this school. Part (b) defines the correct understanding of	1
emptiness (śūnyată) in the context of Yogacara thought. This includes a sixteenfold	1
differentiation of emptiness and contains some of the more enigmatic portions of the	1
text particularly where emptiness is described as having some sort of positive	1
ontological value, i.e. the characteristic of emptiness is defined as the existence of a	1
non-ens. One of the most predominant themes throughout this chapter is the	0
constantly re-stated significance of the imminent relationship between the conventional	1
understanding of phenomena (dharma) and their real nature (dharmata).	1
The second chapter has a more practical orientation than the first insofar as it	1
examines the main obscurations (āvaraṇa) to enlightenment (bodhi). These are reduced	1
to two broad categories, namely, the obscuration that consists in moral defilement and	1
that which consists in the knowable (kleśa-jñeya-āvaraṇa). Firstly, it identifies	1
obscuration that is common to the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva. It	1
then concentrates specifically on the bodhisattva by defining the obscurations to his	1
attainment of (a) the factors that contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya), (b) the	0
perfections (pāramitā) and (c) the spiritual levels (bhūmi).	1
The third chapter provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva). These are	1
identified as the ten main areas where one's understanding of phenomena as they are in	1
reality (yatha-bhūta) is susceptible to confusion especially in regard to erroneous	1
inversion (viparyāsa), imputation and negation. Fundamental to the ten realities are the	1
24 Cf. MAV-Ţika: Y109.5-6 & 164.23ff.xix	0
three natures (tri-svabhāva), i.e. the imaginary (parikalpita), the other-dependent (para-	0
tantra) and the perfected (parinișpanna). These three natures collectively comprise the	1
basic reality (mūla-tattva) which has an intrinsic relationship with the other nine	1
realities. The latter half of the chapter is devoted solely to the tenth reality, the reality of	1
the skills (kausalya-tattva), which leads into a detailed explanation of many of the	0
essential Buddhist doctrines from the Yogācāra point of view. It includes explanation	1
of the meaning of the five aggregates (pańca-skandha), the elements (dhātu) and the	1
sense-fields (ayatana).	1
Chapter four is divided into three sections concerned mainly with description of	1
various aspects of spiritual practice (pratipatti). These are: (a) the correct practices of	1
meditative development (bhāvanā) for the generation of the thirty-seven factors that	1
contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya). The practices are examined through their	1
modes as counteragents (pratipakṣa) to particular adverse elements (vipakşa). These	1
factors include the applications of mindfulness (smṛty-upasthāna), the correct exertions	1
(samyak-prahāna) and the bases of psychic power (ṛddhi-päda). (b) The nine states	1
(avastha) which define the progress of the bodhisattva engaged in these meditative	1
practices. (c) The respective results (phala) that are attained by the bodhisattva	1
stationed in any of these nine states.	0
The fifth chapter extols the virtues of the universal vehicle (mahāyāna) and indeed	1
its superiority over the śrävaka-yana and the pratyekabuddha-yāna. This superiority is	1
explained in relation to three categories: (a) spiritual practice (pratipatti) that is based on	1
the ten perfections, (b) objective support (alambana) which is twelvefold and (c) full	1
attainment (samudāgama) which is tenfold. The chapter depends heavily on the	1
Kāśyapaparivarta section of the Ratnakūṭa for a scriptural basis.	1
The Authorship of the Madhyäntavibhāga	1
The Madhyāntavibhäga [-Kärikā) is one of the five treatises which the Mahāyāna	1
Buddhists traditionally ascribe to Maitreyanatha, the bodhisattva and incumbent	1
Buddha who resides in the Tuşita Heavens. The legendary accounts in the Tibetan	1
tradition 25 tell of his materialization in the presence of the Arya Asang: after he had	1
completed twelve gruelling years of meditative practices. After transporting Asanga to	1
the Tuşita Heavens, it is said that Maitreya instructed him in the fundamental doctrines	1
of the Mahāyāna and then passed on to him five important treatises to be taught for the	1
benefit of sentient beings. They are:	1

No such confusion exists concerning the historicity of Vasubandhu, the author of	1
the MAV-Bhäşya; rather, it is over the actual number of Vasubandhus that	1
contemporary scholars are unable to reach agreement. Traditionally it is believed that	1
there was only one Vasubandhu, who was the younger brother of Asanga.	1

eleventh century after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha and that he was initially allied with	1
various sarvästivāda schools. During this time he composed his definitive work	1
illustrating the vaibhășika and sauträntika doctrines in the Abhidharmakośa and	1
Bhasya. Although originally he was a staunch skeptic of the Mahāyana, is said that	1
through the efforts of Asanga he eventually became convinced of its theoretical and	1
Madhyāntavibhāga	0
Dharmadharmatāvibhāga	1
Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra	1
Ratnagotravibhāga [Uttaratantra]	1
Abhisamāyālamkāra	1
The first three of these stand in close relation as works belonging to the early strata	1
of the Yogacära. The fourth, wherein the tathāgatagarbha doctrine features	1
prominently, has some links with the Yogăcăra (particularly the MSA) but is classified	1
as belonging to the Madhyamika-prasangika school by certain Tibetan writers, notably	1
Tson kha pa26. The fifth is generally regarded as a Madhyamaka work which presents	1
the bodhisattva path based on the Prajñāpāramitā literature.	1
For the past sixty years scholars have remained divided over the precise identity of	1
Maitreyanātha with some, notably U₁27 and Tucci28 preferring to explain him as a	1
historical personage. Others such as Obermiller29 and Demiéville ³0 argue quite	1
convincingly that Maitreya is intended as the tutelary inspiration of Asanga and	1
disclaim the need to read an unwarranted historical facticity into the legendary material.	0
Obermiller³1 has already drawn attention to the fact that it is in the MA V-Țīkā³2 that	1
Maitreya is explicitly described as the bodhisattva who has reached the tenth spiritual	1
level and is separated from Buddhahood by just one birth thus adding credence to his	1
identification as a tutelary entity.	1

practical integrity. It is reported that when he made the decision to enter the	0
Mahāyāna, five hundred of his disciples also made the transition. He is credited with	1
the authorship of numerous original works and commentaries 34 and his reputation for	1
excellence in meditative practices and learning was known throughout the North of	1
India. After the death of Asanga, Vasubandhu became upadhyāya (Abbot) of Nalanda	1
and Taranātha records that he was responsible for the creation of 654 Dharma centres	1
in and around Magadha.	1
The dates of Vasubandhu are problematical. Some scholars argue in favour of the	1
acceptance of more than one author with this name during the period of the third to	1
fifth centuries A.D., while others maintain that the available evidence does not allow	1
for such an interpretation³5. It is a particularly hazy area of study that is based	1
essentially on attempts to reconcile the Tibetan and Chinese historical accounts and	1
hence necessarily contains considerable supposition and speculation. Suffice to say	1
that Vasubandhu, the author of the MAV-Bhäsya, probably lived during the third and	1
fourth centuries A.D.	1
Bu-ston describes Sthiramati as a pupil of Vasubandhu who was more learned in	1
the Abhidharma than his teacher. He is reputed to have joined Vasubandhu at the age	1
of seven and worked diligently at his studies until becoming proficient in all the five	1
sciences. According to the Chinese pilgrim I-Tsing36, Sthiramati was at Nalanda for	1
some years before moving on to Valabhi where he established a monastery and	1
composed most of his works. He was a prolific writer who wrote sub-commentaries	1
to most of Vasubandhu's commentaries in addition to numerous other works 37.	1
Scholars are in rough agreement concerning his dates which can be put approximately	1
at 500-570 A.D.38	1

The arrangement of topics and sub-topics under their respective headings follows	1
Nagao's edition of the Sanskrit Bhāṣya and sometimes differs slightly to the	0
arrangement of Yamaguchi's edition of the Tika. The Karikä and Bhāṣya text is	1
translated in bold type and is placed immediately above the relevant Țikä text. When	1
the Kärikä or Bhãşya is quoted in the Tika, this is also rendered in bold type. The	1
numbers in the left-hand margin indicate: (a) the page number of the Sanskrit texts	1
when a page break occurs or (b) the page and line number of the Sanskrit texts at the	1
beginning of a new topic. The paragraph divisions of the Tīka generally followXxili	1
Yamaguchi's arrangement although this is occasionally changed for the sake of a more	1
coherent separation of Sthiramati's argument and discussion.	1
I have aimed for consistency in the choice of an English term for its Sanskrit or	1
Tibetan equivalent although this principle is occasionally waived when it is felt that the	1
context demands a different nuance. For example, svabhāva is usually translated as	1
"""own-being"", but when used in the context of the tri-svabhāva doctrine, it is rendered"	1
"as ""nature"" as is the normal practice of most contempory commentators. Due to their"	1
multivalent meaning and cumbersome English equivalents, some Sanskrit words have	1
"not been translated: the word dharina is not translated when its sense as ""constituent of"	1
"reality"", or ""ontological category"" etc. is intended; when it is used to refer to the"	1
"doctrine or teachings of the Buddha, it is rendered as ""Dharma"". Where the word"	1
"karma is used chiefly in the sense of ""action"" it is translated as such, however, it is not"	1
translated when it is clear that its other more abstract moral connotations (as the fruition	1
of the actions of the past) are intended. The word jñāna is usually rendered as	1
"""knowledge"" and occasionally ""cognition"" except when it signifies the knowledge that"	1
is free from conceptual discrimination (nirvikalpa), in which case it is translated as	1
"""direct intuition"". This latter sense is often clarified by the Tibetan translation which"	1
renders it as ye ses rather than ses pa.	1
My fundamental principle when translating both Bhāṣya and Țikā has been to take	1
the Sanskrit text as the reference point. If it reads differently to the Tibetan but	1
maintains coherence both syntactically and philosophically, its reading is adopted in	1
preference to the Tibetan and the latter is noted as a variant. In the case of the Tika,	1
any difference between the manuscript reading and Yamaguchi's text is noted. If a	1
coherent rendering is not possible from the manuscript, the Tibetan forms the basis of	1
the translation and an emendation to the Sanskrit is suggested. The translation of the	1
missing portions of the manuscript is always based on the Tibetan, and an	1
improvement is annotated where I am unable to agree with Yamaguchi's	1
reconstruction.Index by Paragraph	1

(Homage to the Buddha)	0
After honouring the author of this	1
treatise, the son of the sugata, and	1
the one who expounded it to us etc.,	1
I shall strive for a critical exami-	0
nation of its meaning.	0
Alternatively, in order to generate reverence towards the author, the expounder, the	1
Sūtra and the commentary by stating that: (a) the author had undertaken the treatise and	1
"(b) the expounder [had undertaken] the commentary, he says all this: ""the author of this"	1
"treatise [etc.]"". In this respect, (a) by demonstrating what is expressed by the author²."	1
reverence is generated towards the Sutra for the Noble Maitreya is the author of this	0
treatise in verse form. Since he is separated [from the attainment of Buddhahood] only	1
by one birth, he has reached the highest perfection of all the bodhisattvas' higher	1
knowledges, mystical formulae, analytical knowledge, meditative concentration,	1
masteries³, intellectual receptivity and emancipations. He has also dispelled the obscu-	1
rations in their entirety on all the bodhisattva levels. (b) Through the correct presen-	0
tation of the expounder, reverence is generated towards the commentary (of	1
(Homage to the Noble Mañjuśri - Kumārabhūta)	0
¹Since pre-eminent people, as a rule, engage in activities after paying homage to	1
their preceptor and to their tutelary deity, in order to show that he too was a follower in	1
the course of pre-eminent people, [Vasubandhu] wishing to compose a commentary on	1
"the Madhyântavibhāga Sūtra says: ""the author of this treatise etc."", demonstrating that"	1
he has undertaken an analysis of its meaning after paying respect to both the author and	1
the expounder. What virtue is obtained when this is done? When respect is paid to	1
one who possesses virtue and is beneficent, merit is accumulated; when merit is accu-	1
mulated, with little effort one completes one's enterprise which is unafflicted by	1
impediments and hindrances.	1
The first folio of the Ms.(1b) is in a particularly bad condition with just occasional words that	1
can be read with any certainty, hence the translation of this folio is based essentially on the	1
Tib. (D1896.2 190a.7).	0
Read (with St. p. 13 fn. 19): pranetroktapradarśanāt in place of pranetra vaktum upadişțāt; Tib.	1

Vasubandhu], for the expounder here is the Noble Asanga. The Venerable Ācārya	0
Vasubandhu, after receiving the teaching from him, composed the commentary to it.	1
Reverence is generated towards the commentary because the meaning of the Sutra is	1
unerringly stated in it because these two, since they possess the highest wisdoms, are	1
able to understand, retain and explain [it], without erring. In this way reverence arises	1
towards both the Sutra and the commentary on the part of those who rely on the	1
authority of individual people. Also, on the part of those who rely on the Dharma,	1
reverence arises towards both the author and the expounder because after the true	1
meaning of the Sutra and the commentary has been understood, when a positive deter-	1
mination occurs, it is brought about through the understanding of the author and the	1
expounder; but is not accomplished through just speculation and scriptural tradition? -	1
thus reverence is generated towards the author and the expounder.	1
This now should be discussed: what is the nature of a treatise and why is it	1
[described as] a śästra ? A treatise consists in representations/conceptualizations	1
appearing as groups of names, words, and syllables. Or rather, a treatise consists in	1
representations appearing as specific words that cause the attainment of supramundane	1
direct intuition. [Objection]: How can representations be formulated or commented	1
upon? [Response]: There is no fault here since the hearer's representations arise from	1
the representations of the author and the expounder. It is a treatise (śästra) because it	1
is an instruction for novices (sisya-śāsana) ¹0. In order to generate excellence in moral-	1
ity, meditative concentration and wisdom, an instruction for novices dissuades them	1
from the actions of body, speech and mind that do not produce the accumulations [of	1
merit and direct intuition], and induces them [to engage] in actions that produce the	1
accumulations. Alternatively, it is a treatise because it conforms with the characteristic	0
of a treatisell. The characteristic of a treatise consists in the fact that, when the teaching	1
is practised, one relinquishes moral defilements along with their latent impressions and	1
is also protected from both becoming and the wretched states of existence which are	1

fearful on account of their manifold sufferings which are intense, continual and long-	0
lasting. Therefore, it has the characteristic of a treatise (śāstra) because it rules over	1
(śāsana) the enemy-like moral defilements, and because it protects (trāṇa)13 from	1
becoming and the wretched states of existence. Moreover, this pair [i.e. 'ruling over'	1
and 'protecting'] are found in all works of the universal vehicle and in their interpre-	1
tations but nowhere else hence this [work] is a treatise [śästra]. It is said:	1
That which rules over the enemy-like moral	0
defilements in their entirety; which rescues	0
[beings from the wretched states of exist-	1
ence and becoming, is a treatise, by virtue	1
of its authority and protection. These two	1
are non-existent in any other doctrinal view.	1
"Of this; the term ""of this"" is a direct reference to the verses of the Madhyānta-"	1
vibhāga śāstra which is a compendium of seven topics and enables the relinquishment	1
of obscuration that consists both in moral defilement and the knowable, by way of the	1
triple vehicle since it is firmly fixed in the [author's] heart.	0
The author refers to the composer. Although this verbal root [n] has the sense	1
of 'conveying', nevertheless, since it is compounded with the prefix pra, it is to be	1
understood in the sense of 'effecting' [lit. 'making']¹4, for it is said:	1
The meaning of a verbal root is forcibly	1
changed through the addition of a prefix,	1
just as the sweetness of the waters of the	0
Ganges [is changed through mixing] with	1
the waters of the sea. 15	1

is [free] from the obscurations that consist in moral defilements, together with their	1
latent impressions, and the obscurations that consist in the knowable. One who has	1
relinquished the obscurations of all latent impressions, who has the understanding of	1
all the dharmas, in every respect, for his essential nature, who is the basis of all might,	1

"sugata; as has been said in another Sutra: ""he is born in the lineage of the tathāgata"	1
"because he has obtained the essential qualities of the latter"". This being the case, an"	1
entity that is to be known21 in all its aspects appears to a bodhisattva established on the	1
tenth spiritual level like a myrobalan fruit on the palm of his hand; however it is as	1
though his eyes were covered by a fine silk veil. But for the Venerable One, the cover-	1
"ing over the eyes is removed as it were this is the difference. By the term ""son of the"	1
"sugata"" in this context [i.e. here sugata means perfectly understood], the perfect under-"	1
standing of reality is indicated on the part of the author of the treatise, and similarly	1
perfect compassion and perfect wisdom [are indicated] through his authorship of the	1
treatise without regard for gain and honour.	1
The expounder; i.e. the agent of exposition. This [term) is connected with the	1
"words ""after honouring"". Others believe that the term ""son of the sugata"" also refers to"	1
him. Moreover, he is the Noble Asanga, for this treatise was disclosed and elucidated	1
to him through the [meditative concentration named] 'stream of dharmas 23 due to the	1
Noble Maitreya's miraculous power.	1
whose body ¹7 possesses inconceivable power like the wishfulfilling gem¹8, who is	0
capable of performing all benefit for all sentient beings effortlessly and who has the	1
nature of the excellence of direct intuition free from conceptual differentiation - he is	1
the sugata. His nature consists in the thusness of purity 19. Since his direct intuition	1
which is free from conceptual differentiation is brought forth20 from the latter, the son	1
of the sugata is born from, or in, that [thusness of purity].	1
24 [The word] and has a conjunctive sense or it is a superfluous word, i.e. it is an	1
expletive. It also implies that he (Vasubandhu) pays respect to the other Buddhas and	1
bodhisattvas, not only to the author and the expounder. In response to the question as	1
to whom it is expounded, he replies: to us etc., which means that we etc.' comprise	1
"those of whom we are the first; it is to the latter that ""to us etc."" refers. Hereby it is"	1
shown that we ourselves have been instructed in a reliable manner25.	1

After honouring; i.e. after paying respect [to him] as though he were actually	1
present and positioned nearby. After honouring, i.e. after paying respect with body,	1
speech and mind. Having paid respect to the author of the treatise and its expounder,	1
what should you do then? He says:	1
I shall strive for a critical examination of meaning; i.e. I shall	1
undertake the effort to critically examine its meaning and to explain its meaning or to	1
make distinctions between things. And here the locative case26 [in the terms artha-	1
vivecane etc.] has the sense of purpose; what is meant is: for the purpose of a critical	1
examination of its meaning.	1
The 'Body' of the Treatise.	1
In this regard, the 'body' of the treatise is respectively determined	1
from the beginning.	1
(a) the characteristic, (b) obscu-	0
ration, (c) reality, (d) the meditative	1
development of the counteragent,	1
(e) the stage therein, (f) the attain-	1
ment of the result and (g) the	1
supremacy of the vehicle.	1
For these seven subjects are expounded in this treatise, namely: (a)	1
the characteristic, (b) obscuration, (c) reality, (d) the meditative	1
development of the counteragent, (e) the state in regard to that medi-	1
tative development of the counteragent, (f) the attainment of the result	1
and (g) the supremacy of the vehicle which is the seventh subject.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
The subjects here [comprise] the 'body' of the treatise because of the state-	1
ment: these seven subjects are expounded in this treatise 27. Why has this	1
treatise been composed? (a) In order to generate correct 28 direct intuition devoid of	1
conceptual differentiation belonging to the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, (b) because	1
direct intuition that is free from conceptual differentiation is generated on account of the	1

Alternatively, [the treatise is undertaken] in order to remove the faintheartedness of	1
the bodhisattvas who, in regard to the fivefold objects of knowledge consisting in the	1
realms of³1: (a) the world sphere, (b) sentient beings. (c) dharmas, (d) moral discipline	1
and (e) expedients, may believe that these are difficult to discern individually because	1
of their infinite differentiation; hence he says:	1
(a) the characteristic, (b) obscu-	1
ration, (c) reality etc.	1
In this regard, the 'body' of the treatise is respectively determined	1
"from the beginning 32. ""In this regard"" [means]: in regard to the critical examination"	1
"of the subjects of the treatise, or else, in regard to the treatise [itself]. ""From the begin-"	1
"ning"" [means]: from the very outset. The term ""treatise"" has already been elucidated 33."	1
Its 'body' is an abridgement or summary meaning; or it is the 'body' in the sense of a	1
basis. For, just as the physical body, which has the external and internal sense-fields	1
for its basis, is described as a 'body', similarly, the subjects upon which a treatise	1
depends and proceeds form its 'body'; and these subjects are seven, beginning with the	1
"characteristic. By ""respectively determined"" is meant: 'designated', or, 'explained'³4."	0
teaching29 of the insubstantiality of the dharmas, and (c) due to the practice of the latter	0
[the bodhisattva] obtains the complete relinquishment of obscuration consisting in both	0
the knowable and moral defilement together with their latent impressions. Further-	0
more, concerning the insubstantiality of the dharmas, this treatise is undertaken in order	1
to present the insubstantiality of the dharmas as it is in reality by refuting these two	1
incompatible views: (a) that the non-existence of all dharmas is [equivalent to] the	1
insubstantiality of the dharmas, and (b) that the non-existence of an internally active	1
being is [equivalent to the insubstantiality of the dharmas³0	1
Others believe [the treatise is undertaken] in order to remove both the lack of	0
insight and wrong insight on the part of those who lack insight or possess wrong	1
insight in regard to the characteristic and obscuration etc. through the generation of	1
correct understanding.	1

[Objection]: is it not so that this 'body' will be discerned just through an understanding	1
of the treatise and thus its respective determination at the beginning serves no purpose?	1
[Response]: No, it is not without purpose for the subjects are helpful for novices	1
because a novice who has an appreciation of the subjects understands the details with	1
ease when they are being discussed, like a horse galloping without fear on familiar	1
ground 35, it is not for any other reason. For these seven subjects are	1
expounded 36 in this treatise. What is meant by this statement is that the 'body' of	1
"the treatise is complete 37. By ""these"" (is meant] the [subjects] beginning with the char-"	1
"acteristic that are listed. ""Seven"" is their number; it is an enumeration in order to reveal"	0
the total 38. They are subjects (artha) because they are sought (arthyante), i.e. insofar as	1
"they are understood. By ""in this treatise"" is meant: in [this work) titled the Madhyānta-"	1
"vibhāga. By ""expounded"" is meant: ""explained"" or ""ascertained""39. Namely40; this is"	1
the term that introduces these bjects. The characteristic; it is a characteristic	1
(lakṣaṇa) insofar as [things) are characterized (lakṣyante) by this. And it is twofold:	1
the characteristic of defilement and the characteristic of purification. Of these, the char-	1
"acteristic of defilement is ninefold, beginning with: ""there is unreal imagination"" (I.la),"	1
"and concluding with: ""because of the seven kinds of unreal imagination"" (I.11d). The"	1
characteristic of purification is explained in the remaining half [of the first chapter].	1
[Objection]: If it is said that it is a characteristic because [something] is characterized	1
by it, this being the case, the characteristic would be something different from defile-	1
ment and purification. [Response]: This is not so because the characteristic of some-	1
thing is none other than its own-being. For example, the element earth has the char-	1
acteristic of solidity, and the element earth is not something separate from solidity,	1
Alternatively, it is a characteristic insofar as [something] is characterized as that. For	0
thus, defilement and purification are characteristics insofar as [something] is charac-	1
terized as being of the nature of defilement or purification. Or again, the characteristic	1
of both defilement and purification is a twofold characteristic: the individual character-	1
istic and the universal characteristic. Obscuration (ävaraṇa) is so-called because it	1
conceals (avṛṇoti) the wholesome dharmas; or else, it is an obscuration (avaraṇa) since	1
the wholesome dharmas are concealed (vriyante) by it since it prevents their arising.	1
Furthermore, these obscurations have fifty-three modes. Reality implies that 'this'	1

here is none other than 'that'; the state (bhāva = -tva) of 'that' (tar) is 'reality' (tattva);	0
what is meant is: it is free from erroneous inversion and it has ten modes. The	1
counteragent is the side that has the relinquishment of the adverse elements for its	1
aim it is the path; the practice of that is meditative development. The state refers	1
to the particular [states] of that [path] which arise in a continuous sequence. This has	1
nineteen modes beginning with the state of the spiritual lineage. The attainment of	1
the result42; i.e. obtaining the 'fruit'; this has fifteen modes beginning with the karma-	1
result. The supremacy of the vehicle; it is a vehicle since one travels by it, and	1
since it is a vehicle and is also supreme, it is described as the supremacy of the vehicle.	1
Furthermore, it is threefold beginning with the supremacy of spiritual practice. He	1
states that this is the seventh subject so as to delimit (the exact number of subjects]	1
and also to [show] their sequential order. Just this many subjects are explained, i.e.	1
there are none other than these.	1
Now, this sequence is for conformity with supramundane direct intuition; for thus	1
the bodhisattva stationed at the spiritual level43 of one who courses in firm conviction	0
and is established in morality, should firstly become skilled in defilement and purifi-	1
cation. Then, that particular obscuration to each wholesome dharma should be known	1
because liberation is not possible without relinquishing it; and one is unable to relin-	1
quish what has not been discerned 44 since the fault is not seen. Then, that objective	1
support through which the mind is liberated from a particular obscuration should be	0
understood as reality 45. After that, the application which destroys that obscuration on	1
account of that particular objective support is to be known as the meditative develop-	1
ment of the counteragent. Then, owing to the diminution of the adverse elements and	1
the increase in the counteragent, the state in regard to that meditative development of	1
the counteragent should be known as the state of the spiritual lineage etc. Following	1
from that there is the actual presence of the supramundane dharmas, i.e. the results	1
which should be known as the result of winning the stream etc. And this whole	1
[sequential progression] is common to the bodhisattvas and the śrävakas together with	1
"their novices46 as has been stated in a Sutra: ""this recluse is trained in the instructions,"	1
conduct, associations and modes of address of the śrävaka, is trained in the instruc-	1
tions, conduct, associations and modes of address of the pratyekabuddha, is trained in	1
"the instructions, conduct, associations and modes of address of the bodhisattva."""	1
However, since the supremacy of the bodhisattva is not common [to the others),	1
supremacy is the seventh subject.	1

However, another (school] says that the characteristic [is explained] at the begin-	1
ning in order to generate skill in regard to the characteristic of defilement and purifi-	1
cation. Of these, defilement is [equivalent to] obscuration, and purification is	1
[equivalent to] a reality; and since the relinquishment of obscuration is due to the	1
understanding of reality, hence the [subjects of obscuration and reality [follow in	1
successive order]. After that comes the counteragent together with its associated	1
elements, i.e. the path, in order to demonstrate the expedients for the relinquishment of	1
that [obscuration]. The state therein [is then explained] in order to demonstrate the	1
weak, middling and higher differentiations 47 in relation to the beginning, middle and	1
end of the path. And since the state brings a corresponding result, the result [is	1
explained] immediately after that. All these are common to the bodhisattva and the	1
śrävaka etc., thus the supremacy of the vehicle [is then explained] in order to proclaim	1
that the universal vehicle is not common [to the śrāvaka etc.].	1
Others again say that the characteristic is stated at the beginning in order to show	1
the characteristics of existence and non-existence. When the characteristic is known,	1
obscuration should be relinquished and reality should be realized, thus, immediately	1
after that, obscuration and reality [are explained]. The meditative development of the	1
counteragent [is explained next] since this is the expedient for both the relinquishment	1
and realization [respectively] of the latter two and the special states are (equivalent to]	1
the successive degrees of that [meditative development]. And the result is the relin-	1
quishment caused by the latter. In order to demonstrate that immediately after that	1
[comes] the supremacy of the vehicle, this sequence [has been explained).	1
Others now believe 49 that the explanation of the characteristic for the purpose of	1
relinquishing negation and imputation for one who is confused about the existence or	1
non-existence of the dharmas. Obscuration is for the purpose of [developing] skill in	1
regard to obscuration for one whose confusion has been relinquished. Since reality is	1
obscured by the latter, reality comes immediately after that for the purpose of	1
[developing] skill in regard to reality. Since there is the relinquishment of obscuration	1
through meditative development which penetrates reality50, the meditative development	1
of the counteragent [is explained] immediately after reality. In order to develop skill in	1
the classification of these [counteragents) the state [is then explained]. And since the	1
result is constituted by the state, immediately after the state comes the result in order to	1
generate skill in that. The supremacy of the vehicle is explained at the end because this	1
whole [sequential progression takes place] owing to the universal vehicle.	1

The Defining Characteristics	1
1. The Imagination of What is Unreal.	1
a. The Characteristic of Existence and Non-	1
Existence.	1
Therein, concerning the characteristic, he says:	1
I.1 abcd	0
There is the imagination of what is	1
unreal; the duality is not found	1
therein; but here emptiness is found	1
and the former is found in the latter.	1
In this [verse], the imagination of what is unreal refers to the con-	1
ceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and the apprehending	1
subject. The duality refers to the apprehended object and the appre-	1
hending subject. Emptiness is the absence of apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject on the part of that unreal imagination. When he	1
"says: ""and the former is found in the latter"", [""the former"" refers to the"	1
imagination of what is unreal. Thus, the characteristic of emptiness	1
"which is not erroneously inverted is shown by this quotation5¹: ""One"	1
perceives [phenomena] as they are in reality by realizing that where	1
something is non-existent, it is empty of that, and furthermore one	1
correctly comprehends [phenomenal as they are in reality by realizing	1
"that what is left as a remainder in this respect does really exist here""."	1
1.2 abcd	1
Therefore all is established as neither	1
empty nor not empty, because of	1
existence, non-existence and again	0
existence; and this is the middle way.	0
[All] is neither empty of emptiness and unreal imagination, nor not	1
empty of the duality of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
"subject. ""All"" refers to both the conditioned [phenomenal which are"	1
called 'the imagination of what is unreal', and the unconditioned	1
"[phenomena] which are called 'emptiness'. The term ""is established"""	1
"[means] ""is explained"". Because of the existence of: unreal imagin-"	1
G. Nagao has shown that this passage probably comes from the Salasuññata sutta (Majjhima-	0
"nikaya sutta no. 121); cf. his ""What Remains' in Sunyata: A Yogacara Interpretation of"	1
"Emptiness"" in Mahāyāna Buddhist Meditation....Y10"	1
ation; because of the non-existence of: the duality; and because of the	0
existence of emptiness in the imagination of what is unreal and [the	1
existence of the imagination of the unreal in the former. Moreover,	1
this is the middle way. All [phenomenal are neither absolutely empty	1
nor are they absolutely not empty. Thus, this passage in the	1
"Prajñāpāramitās etc.: ""all this is neither empty nor not empty"", is in"	1
agreement.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Therein, concerning the characteristic, he says:	1
I.1 abcd	0
There is the imagination of what is	1
unreal; the duality is not found	1
therein; but here emptiness is found,	1
and the former is found in the latter.	1
Therein [means] with reference to, or with regard to the characteristic, among the	1
seven subjects mentioned above, such as the characteristic and obscuration, he says:	1
"""[there is] the imagination of what is unreal""52. Considering that the explanation com-"	1
plies with the way [the subjects] are listed and the characteristic was listed firstly,	1
hence, the explanation of just that [subject] is undertaken initially rather than the other	1
[subjects).	1
[2] Some believe53 that all dharmas are devoid of own-being in every respect, like	1
"horns on a hare, hence, in order to refute their total negation he says: ""there is the"	0
"imagination of what is unreal""; the ellipsis here is: ""by way of own-being""."	1
[Objection]: Is it not so that such a statement is at variance with the Sutras because it is	1
"said in a Sūtra: ""all dharmas are empty""? [Response]: There is no contradiction"	1
"because: ""therein the duality is not found"". For the imagination of what is unreal is"	1
described as empty, i.e. as devoid of the essential nature of the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject, but not as devoid of own-being in every respect; consequently, it	1
is not at variance with the Sūtras. [Objection]: If the duality is thus non-existent in	1
every respect, like horns on a hare, and unreal imagination does exist by way of own-	1
being in an absolute sense, then emptiness would be non-existent. [Response]: This is	1
"not so because: ""but here emptiness is found"". For, since this is the very emptiness"	1
which consists in the absence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject in	1
the imagination of what is unreal, emptiness is not non-existent. If emptiness is free	0

which agrees with the Tib. (cf. D193b.5)	1
Read: kecin manyante in place of ke cid virundhanti; Tib. la la dag... sňam du sems pa	1
(D193b.6).S	1
from the duality and exists in unreal imagination, why is it that we are not [already]	0
liberated; and if it were something existing, why is it not apprehended?54 order to	1
"remove such a doubt, he says: ""and the former is found in the latter""; because the"	0
imagination of what is unreal is found in emptiness too, therefore one is not [already]	1
liberated. And this is why [emptiness] cannot be perceived, like the clear water	1
element [cannot be perceived], because it is accompanied by stain.	1
[3] Alternatively, in order to refute that [false] view of those who believe that mind,	1
"the mental concomitants and also form exist substantially55, he says: ""there is the"	0
"imagination of what is unreal"". The latter certainly exists substantially but form does"	1
not exist separately from it; (form] does not exist substantially. What is the reason?	1
"Because: ""the duality is not found therein""; for, the imagination of the unreal is not the"	1
apprehending of something nor is it apprehended by anyone. What is	1
then? It is just	1
a 'bare' existent devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending subject. For thus,	1
form and the like are not apprehended externally to consciousness; consciousness	1
arises in the appearance of form etc., like in dreams etc., and if it has a cause, its arising	1
in the absence of one is not tenable. Therefore it is devoid of an objective support, just	1
as in dreams and the like; elsewhere too it is to be concluded that consciousness is pro-	1
duced in the appearance of the object due to the maturation of an individual 'seed'. The	1
existence of the apprehending subject is not tenable if the apprehended object does not	1
exist because, if the apprehended object does not exist, the apprehending subject [too]	1
does not exist 56. Therefore, form does not exist separately from unreal imagination.	1
[Objection]: If the apprehended object does not exist, there can be no liberation because	1
of the absence of an objective support of purity. [Response]: This is not so because:	1
"""but here emptiness is found""; the word ""bur"" has the sense of ""because"". For."	0
emptiness is the objective support of purity57 and since it exists as an absence of the	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject in the imagination of what is unreal,	1
liberation is not non-existent. [Objection]: If it exists and is present in unreal imagina-	1
tion, what is the reason that it is not apprehended? [Response]: It is not apprehended	1
because it is obscured by unreal imagination, like the stainlessness 58 of space [is not	1
apprehended] but not because it does not exist. In order to illustrate this point he	1
"says: ""and the former is found in the latter""."	1

[5] Alternatively, there is no characteristic other than that mentioned in regard to	1
defilement and purification, hence in order to explain the characteristic of defilement	1
"and purification, he says: ""there is the imagination of what is unreal"". Defilement has"	1
the imagination of what is unreal for its own-being because it is characterized by error.	1
"How should the fact that it is characterized by error be understood? Because: ""the"	1
"duality is not found therein"". It is known to have an essential nature that consists in"	1
error because it manifests in the aspect of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject which do not exist in its own nature. Now in order to examine63 the nature of	1
"purification, he says: ""but here emptiness is found""; for the own-being of emptiness is"	1
purification because its own-being consists in the non-existence of the duality. And in	1
this context, the inclusion of both the path and cessation should be understood because	1
they are constituted by emptiness. In order to demonstrate that the side of purification	1
is to be sought from the side of defilement and the individual continuum does not exist	1
"separately 64, he says: ""here"". The question arises: if the duality does not exist, how can"	0
"[4] Alternatively, in order to refute all negation, he says: ""there is the imagination of"	1
"what is unreal""; considering that it is not entirely non-existent, nor does it have the"	1
nature of an existent since it exists in the nature of the transformation of consciousness.	1
However, there are those who believe that form etc. exists, by way of own-being, in	1
exactly that way in which they manifest, i.e. as separate from unreal imagination. With	1
regard to such [people] and in order to refute imputation in regard to what is unreal 59,	1
"he says: ""the duality is not found therein"". The intended meaning is that there is just"	1
'bare' unreal imagination. The non-existence of the duality 60 is apprehended by some	1
as of the nature of annihilation61, like [the absolute non-existence of the son of an	1
infertile woman. The absence of an internally active being is said to be fequivalent to]	1
the emptiness of the dharmas by others. Hence, in order to refute the negation of	1
"emptiness, and in order to reveal insubstantiality in reality, he says: ""but here emptiness"	1
"is found"". [Objection]: If emptiness exists in the imagination of what is unreal, then all"	1
"living beings would be liberated effortlessly. [Response]: This is not so because: ""and"	1
"the former is found in the latter""; since there is no liberation in an emptiness that has"	1
not been purified and [emptiness) that has been defiled62 is purified by a mighty effort,	1
thus there is no liberation without effort.	1

[7] The duality refers to the apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject; of these, the apprehended object refers to form etc.; the apprehending subject,	1
to eye consciousness etc. For, emptiness is the absence 67, or devoidedness, of the	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject on the part of the imagination of	1
what is unreal, however the imagination of what is unreal itself is not non-existent; just	1
as a rope is empty of the own-being of a snake 68 because never at any time does it	1
possess such an own-being, but it is not that a rope69 is empty of own-being. It is the	1
same in this respect [i.e. unreal imagination is not empty of own-being]. When he	1
"says: ""the former is found in the latter"", [""the former"" refers to] the"	1
imagination of what is unreal; for thus it has been described as not apprehended	1
because it is defiled by adventitious obscuration, like the [clarity of the] water-element	1
"etc. Thus... ""one perceives [phenomenal... by realizing that where"	0
"the world be in error if that [emptiness] exists? Hence he says: ""and the former is"	1
"found in the latter""."	1
[6] There the conceptual differentiation65 of the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject, just like the aspects etc. of elephants (which are imagined]	1
in a magical creation that is empty of the aspects of elephants etc.66 It is the imagin-	1
ation of what is unreal (abhūtaparikalpa) since the duality which is unreal (abhūta)	1
"is imagined (parikalpyate) in it, or by it. By the word ""unreal"" he demonstrates that"	1
this [phenomenal world] does not exist in the way in which it is imagined, i.e. as the	1
[dichotomy of] apprehended object and apprehending subject. By the word	1
"""imagination"" he demonstrates that the way in which an object is imagined [qua exist-"	1
ent object], it does not exist as such. Thus the characteristic of this [unreal imagin-	1
ation] is revealed as being quite devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject. What then is it? The mind and the mental concomitants of the past, present	0
and the future, which consist in cause and result, which pertain to the three realms of	1
existence, which exist from time immemorial, which end in nirvana and which are in	1
conformity with samsāra, are, without exception, unreal imagination; but especially it	1
refers to the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject. Therein the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object refers to	1
consciousness with its appearances as objects and sentient beings. The conceptual	1
differentiation of the apprehending subject refers to the appearances as the self and	1
n.ental representations.	0

something 70 is non-existent, it is empty of that. What does not exist in what?	0
The duality [does not exist] in the imagination of the unreal; consequently, one sees	1
that the imagination of the unreal is empty of the duality; and furthermore what	1
"is left as a remainder in this respect does really exist here..."". Just what"	1
is left as a remainder here? The imagination of the unreal and emptiness since both of	1
these exist herein, seeing without superimposition and negation, one correctly	1
comprehends [phenomena] as they are in reality. It is free from superimpo-	1
sition in this regard because one sees the absence of the duality in the imagination of	1
the unreal; and it is free from negation because one sees the existence of both the	1
imagination of the unreal and emptiness. The characteristic of emptiness,	1
which is not erroneously inverted, is shown...; because of the actual existence	1
of that which is empty and because of the non-existence therein of that which it is	1
empty of. If on the one hand all [dharmas] exist or on the other, all were non-existent,	1
the characteristic of emptiness would not be non-erroneously inverted because this	1
would lead to the non-existence of emptiness itself. If that which is called 'empty' were	1
non-existent, emptiness would not be tenable, because real nature (dharmată) is depen-	1
dent upon something existent, like the impermanence [of what impermanent] etc. If	1
the duality did exist, emptiness would not exist. [Objection]: If [the non-existence of]	1
the duality is just like the [absolute non-existence of the hors of a hare?!, how is the	1
emptiness of that (duality] on the part of the imagination of the unreal possible, for that	1
the one is empty of the other has (already been seen? For example, a hermitage can be	1
[empty] of monks72. [Response]: This is not so7³; just as a rope74 or a magical	1
creation, although non-existent in themselves, appear in the aspect of a snake or as men	1
etc. and are described as empty of the snake and men etc. in order to check the grasping	1
of any [entity) there. Similarly, the imagination of the unreal too, which manifests in	1
the aspect of the apprehended object and apprehending subject which are non-existent	1
in themselves, is described as empty 75 of the duality in order to induce naive people to	1
abandon their attachment to such a notion76.	1

For what reason was this verse composed? In order to show that all conditioned and	1
unconditioned [dharmas] are devoid of the duality77. For thus 78, by rejecting absolute-	1
ness the intended meaning of the quotation from the Prajñāpäramitās is made	1
"evident79: ""All this is neither empty nor not empty"". For otherwise 80 there"	0
would be an inconsistency between the former and the latter. Furthermore, [this verse	1
was composed] in order to demonstrate the middle way; otherwise it would lead to the	1
extremes of that which is absolutely empty on the one hand; and that which is not	1
empty on the other, Alternatively, it was composed to sum up the refutation of both	1
negation and imputation. The imagination of what is unreal is conditioned because it	1
possess a nature82 that is bound to causes and conditions; however, emptiness is	0
"unconditioned because it does not depend on these. ""Is established"" [means] is"	1
quoted in the Prajñāpāramitās and other works. Because of existence, i.e. of the	0
imagination of what is unreal that which is conditioned is not empty since it has	1
the nature of the imagination of the unreal. Because of non-existence, i.e. of the	1
duality it is empty of the nature of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
And because of existence, i.e. of emptiness in the imagination of what is	1
unreal83, considering that that [emptiness] is the real nature of the latter; the imagin-	1
ation of the unreal is found in emptiness too in the nature of the possessor of that	1
dharma. Similarly, even what is unconditioned is not empty of the nature of real nature	1
but is described as a non-existent insofar as it is empty of a nature that consists in the	1
duality84	1
"""To say it exists, O Kāśyapa, this86 is one extreme and to say it does not"	1

This middle way is thus in agreement88 [with the latter]. All refers to the condi-	1
tioned and unconditioned (dharmas); they are neither absolutely empty, because	1
of the actual existence of both the imagination of what is unreal and the emptiness of	1
that, nor are they absolutely not empty, because of the non-existence of the	1
duality. If all [dharmas] were to exist, or all were non-existent89, these would indeed	1
be extremes and not the middle way.	1
b. The Individual Characteristic.	1
Thus, having stated both the characteristic of existence and the char-	1
acteristic of non-existence on the part of the imagination of the unreal,	1
he states the individual characteristic:	1
I.3 abcd	0
Consciousness comes into being in	1
the appearances as objects, sentient	0
beings, the self and representations,	1
although its object does not exist.	1
Due to the non-existence of the	1
latter, the former too does not exist.	1
The appearance as object therein refers to that which appears as an	1
entity of form etc. The appearance as sentient being refers to that	1
which [appears] as the five sense-faculties within one's own and others'	1
mental continuum. The appearance as self refers to the defiled mind	1
because this is associated with delusion about the self etc.	1
The appear-	1
"ance as representations refers to the six consciousnesses. ""Although its"	1
"object does not exist"" because the appearances as objects and sentient"	1
beings is without aspect, and because the appearances as self and repre-	1
"sentations are false appearances. ""Due to the non-existence of the"	1
"latter, the former too does not exist"" because of the non-existence of"	1
the latter, i.e. the fourfold object to be apprehended, namely, form etc.,	1
the five sense faculties, mind and the six consciousnesses, the former	1
too does not exist, i.e. the apprehending consciousness.	1
I.4 abc	1
Consequently, it has been proven	1
that the imagination of what is unreal	1
pertains to this [consciousness];	1

because it does not exist as such, nor	1
is it non-existent in every respect.	1
1.4 d	1
Because it does not exist in that way in which it arises as an appear-	1
ance, nor is it non-existent in every respect because of the production	1
of 'bare' error. What is the reason then that its definite non-existence is	1
not accepted? Because...	1
Liberation is considered as being due	0
to its extinction.	1
Otherwise there would be the fault of the negation of defilement and	1
purification since neither bondage nor liberation could be established.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Thus, having stated both the characteristic of existence and the char-	1
acteristic of non-existence on the part of the imagination of what is	1
unreal...; the characteristic of its existence is existence itself since this is characterized	1
by existence; what is meant is: he demonstrates the existence of the imagination of	1
"what is unreal by this statement: ""there is the imagination of what is unreal"". Similarly,"	1
the characteristic of its non-existence is non-existence itself since this is characterized	1
by non-existence. Furthermore, this refers to that which does not exist as the appre-	1
hended object and apprehending subject; because the duality does ot exist in unreal	1
imagination therefore it is said that unreal imagination too does not exist in the nature	1
of the duality. Now he states the individual characteristic. What is the differ-	1
ence between the characteristic of existence and the individual characteristic? The char-	1
acteristic of existence is a universal, but the individual characteristic is a particular.	1
What would be the consequence if the individual characteristic were not stated here?	1
The 'body' of the imagination of what is unreal would not be mentioned, hence, in	1
order to clearly illustrate its 'body' it is said:	1
I.3 abcd	1
Consciousness comes into being in	1
the appearances as objects, sentient	0
beings, the self and representations,	1
although its object does not exist.	1
Due to the non-existence of the	1
latter, the former too does not exist.	1
Alternatively, it is not known how the sense faculties, sense-objects and consciousness	1
are established in relation to that 'bare' imagination of the unreal referred to above as the	1
existence of just the 'bare' imagination of the unreal devoid of the apprehended objectY17	1
and apprehending subject 90; thus in order to show that they are established in relation	1
to that according to their differentiation as the appearances of the imagination of the	1
"unreal, he states the individual characteristic of the imagination of the unreal: ""in the"	1
"appearances as objects, sentient beings, the self and representations"" etc."	1
"[3] Alternatively, by the [words] ""there is the imagination of what is unreal"", its 'bare'"	1
existence is made known92 but not its own-being; and if the duality is non-existent, the	1
reason for the notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject	1
is not discerned. Also it has not been discussed as to why it is recognized that the	1
"duality does not exist, hence in order to clearly illustrate this, he says: ""in the appear-"	1
"ances as objects, sentient beings, the self and representations"". In this regard, the imagi-"	0
nation of the unreal is the own-being of consciousness, and consciousness together	1
with its associated elements is intended here 93, but it is chiefly consciousness itself that	1
is referred to. The ground for that notional attachment to the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject is the appearances as objects and sentient beings etc.94.	1
"""Although its object does not exist. Due to the non-existence of the latter, the former"	1
"too does not exist""- this is the reason why the duality is non-existent. The appearances"	1
as objects and sentient beings therein refers to the store-consciousness together with its	0
associates; and the latter is definitely undefined because it is the karma-result. The	1
appearance as the self refers to defiled mind together with its associated elements; and	1
that is described as obscured and undefined because it is associated with moral defile-	1
ment. The appearances as mental representations refers to the group of the six begin-	1
ning with eye-consciousness together with their associates; these are wholesome,	1
unwholesome and undefined. In this way, these eight consciousnesses, together with	1
their associated elements, come forth in the appearances as objects, sentient beings, self	1
and representations in the five respective states of existence, from the store-conscious-	1
ness which depends upon co-operating conditions and which incorporates the [noble]	1
truth of the arising (of suffering]. There is a certain 'special transformation' of the	1
latent impressions of the wholesome, unwholesome and undefined dharmas in the	1
store-consciousness and through the influence of that, consciousness comes into being	0

[4] ...As an entity of form etc. [Consciousness) appears in the nature of form,	1
sound, odour, taste, contact and non-sensibles because it arises in such an aspect. The	0
appearance as sentient beings refers to that which [appears] as the five	1
sense faculties within one's own and others' mental continuum96; the term:	1
"""appears"" is understood 97. With regard to the five sense faculties, there is the appella-"	1
tion sattva because it is the locus of excessive attachment (sakti); it is sentient being	1
(sattva) since it is attached (sajjate) by, or to, these [sense faculties]. Because it arises	1
in such an aspect, consciousness possesses that particular appearance. The appear-	1
ance as self refers to defiled mind because that is associated with	1
delusion about self etc.98; because defiled mind is always 99 associated with	1
delusion about self, the false view of self, the craving for selfi00 and self conceit.	1
Since these [four] have the self for their objective support it is proper¹01 that the	1
appearance as the self pertains to defiled mind. The appearance as representa-	1
tions refer to the six consciousnesses. The appearance as representations	1
[occurs] on account of the arising of the aspects of those [consciousnesses] through	1
manifesting in the nature of apprehenders of sense-objects.	1
"[5] ""Although its object does not exist"", i.e. [the object which arises] in these"	1
four aspects, because the appearances as objects and sentient beings are	1
without aspect, and because the appearances as self and representations	1
are false appearances. Since the appearances as objects and sentient beings mani-	1
fest in the nature of the apprehended object, the reason for the non-existence of the	1
in mutually differentiated appearances. [Objection]: How does consciousness arise in	0
the appearance of those [entities] if the objects etc. do not exist, for when there is no	1
person [present] a post95 does not appear as a person? [Response]: This is not a fault	1
for naive people are notionally attached to consciousness in the appearance of objects	1
etc. as objects that exist separately from consciousness, like the 'hair-nets' seen by a	1
person with impaired eyesight. Therefore, in order to induce them to abandon their	1
"attachment to those [objects etc.] it is said: ""this is just consciousness that arises in the"	1
appearances of objects etc. although devoid of objects and sentient beings etc., just as	1
"there is the appearance of 'hair-nets' etc. for those people who have ophthalmia"". Thus"	1
it is said that the other-dependent [nature] with its entities of the eight consciousnesses	1
comprises the imagination of what is unreal.	1

object is precisely that it is without aspect, because of the impossibility of its being a	0
false appearance. However, because the other two [i.e. self and representations} mani-	1
fest in the nature of the apprehending subject, they are not without aspect and the	1
reason given for the non-existence of the object [in these cases] is precisely that they	1
consist in false appearances. For the aspect is the mode of the 'taking hold' of the	1
objective support in the nature of something impermanent etc. and this does not exist in	1
the [former] two [i.e. objects and sentient beings] because they manifest in the nature	1
"of the apprehended object. Hence, ""because it is without aspect"" means: because there"	1
is no apprehender. Alternatively, the aspect consists in the correct knowledge of the	1
objective support and since this is non-existent on the part of the latter [i.e. objects and	0
sentient beings], they are without aspect because of the non-existence of the objective	1
support102	0
[6] [Objection]: If both [objects and sentient beings are without aspect and have	1
natures that are mutually differentiated, i.e. just as there is form etc. on the one hand	1

consciousness rather than form etc. and sight etc. which are well known both generally	1
and exegetically, whence, after rejecting them, consciousness is perceived to have a	1
nature that is not differentiated from them? [Response]: Because it is impossible that	1
the object [exists] separately from that [consciousness). This is respectively deter-	1
mined as follows: consciousness in the appearances of different objects etc. brought	1
forth from an individual 'seed' each one appropriated 103 by each particular determin-	1
ation of the mental continuum, although the essential nature of the different objects	1
does not exist. Thus for example, the pretas see [a river] filled with pus, excrement	1
and urine etc. guarded on both sides of the river by men with sticks in their hands 104;	1
however, humans and the like perceive it as filled with pure, clear water and as quite	1
inoffensive 105. Also, the ascetics, who practice mental attention in regard to impure	1
things etc., see the ground completely covered by skeletons; and likewise, in regard to	1
[all the topics of contemplation] such as [the element] 'earth', they see everything	1
pervaded by earth etc. Moreover, the generation 106 of a consciousness which	1
possesses a nature that depends upon an object is not tenable without that object, nor	1
[is the generation of a consciousness tenable] whose aspects are different from the	1
essential nature of the object. Therefore it is ascertained that it is just consciousness	1

[the existence of such an object.	1
[7] Both the appearances as the self and representations are false appearances because	1
they manifest in the aspect of the apprehending subject although the apprehended	1
object does not exist. Alternatively, the object does not exist in that way in which it is	1
imaginatively constructed by consciousness; it is a false appearance because it is a false	1
objective support, just as when sounds etc. [are imagined as the roaring] of tigers etc.	1
Similarly, it is an established fact that mental representations too are devoid of a nature	1
that is imaginatively constructed 108 by another representation. Hence the object of the	1
appearances as the self and representations also does not exist, just like [the objects) of	1
the appearances as objects and sentient beings109. Because of the non-existence	1
of the ...object, ...the former too does not exist, i.e. consciousness...; it	1
is described as consciousness (vijñāna) since it discerns (vijānāti)110. If the appre-	1
hended object does not exist, the [existence of the discerning agent is not tenable.	1
Therefore, due to the non-existence of the object, consciousness does not exist as a	1
discerning agent; but not so [regarding consciousness] in the appearances of objects,	1
sentient beings, the self and representations, for, if the latter were non-existent it would	1
result in total non-existence since there can be no explanation for the essential nature of	1
consciousness apart from this. If its essential nature were different from this how	1
would [the existence] of that consciousness be tenable? How could one be differen-	1
tiated from the other?	1
[8] Thus, because of the non-existence of the apprehended object and the appre-	1
hending subject and due to the actual existence of consciousness in the appearance of	1
"the latter, that which was asserted previously, i.e. ""there is the imagination what is"	0

order to prove the existence of unreal imagination¹12 and in order to prove the non-	0
existence of the duality, he says:	1
Because it does not exist as such,	1
nor is it non-existent in every respect	1
"Alternatively, by ""consequently"" is meant: by the reason that will be stated below. In"	0
"order to demonstrate just this, he says: ""because it does not exist as such, nor is it non-"	1
"existent in every respect."" Because it does not exist as such and because it is not non-"	1
existent in every respect [consciousness] arises in the appearance of the apprehended	1
object and apprehending subject. Although, in this regard, there are four modes [of	1
appearance], there is no apprehending subject because [the first two modes] are with-	1
out aspect and because [the latter two] are false appearances, respectively.	1
Furthermore, there is no apprehended object because all [four modes] are devoid of a	1
nature that is imaginatively constructed113 by another representation. Nor is it non-	1
existent in every respect because of the production of 'bare' errori14; that	1
"which appears in an aspect, although non-existent in itself115, is described as ""error""; it"	1
"is like a magical creation. The word ""bare"" has the sense of the exclusion of what is"	1
additional to it. This is what is being said: because of the actual existence of	1
consciousness that consists in error, [consciousness] is not non-existent in every	1
respect.	1
[9] What then is the reason that the definite non-existence of that	1
consciousness that consists in error is not accepted, like the non-existence¹16 of the	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject [is accepted]? If [such a question]	1
implies that its existence is unable to be imagined by anyone since it transcends the	1
domain of all consciousnesses, [the answer is] because...	1
Liberation is considered as being due	1
to its extinction ¹17.	1
Hence its definite non-existence is not accepted; on the contrary, its existence is	1
inferred because of its capacity (as a basis] for the sides of defilement and purification.	1
Otherwise, if its definite non-existence in every respect is accepted, there would be	1
neither bondage nor liberation 118. If 'bare' error also did not exist, bondage too would	1

not exist because there would be no defilement. Liberation too would not exist,	0
considering that it is from a previous state of bondage that one is released.	1
[10] Alternatively, in order to exclude other interpretations which beg the questions:	1
"""why is [consciousness that consists in error] not considered as existent in that way in"	1
"which it manifests 119, or else, as non-existent in every respect? He says: ""liberation"	1
"considered as being due to its extinction"" 120; what is meant is: when that is not com-"	1
pletely extinguished¹21 there is bondage. This is what is being said: 122 otherwise	1
there would bel23 the fault of the negation of defilement and purifi-	1
cation 124 since neither bondage nor liberation [could be established]. If	1
[phenomena] were to exist absolutely in exactly that way in which they appear as the	0
apprehended object and apprehending subject for [all beings] from cattle upwards¹25,	0
this being the case, defilement would be eternal and thus there would be no nirvāṇa.	0
Similarly, if 'bare' error were also non-existent, there would be no defilement, and	1
purification would be eternal. Thus in both cases, the effort of those who seek libera-	1
tion would be in vain and consequently, the existence of the imagination of what is	1
unreal should necessarily be admitted as well as the non-existence of the duality.	1
Having thus stated the individual characteristic of the imagination of	1
what is unreal, he states the characteristic of the totality, i.e., the way in	1
which there is a totality of the three natures when there is the 'bare'	1
imagination of what is unreal.	1

The object consists in the imaginary nature; the imagination of what	1

[Sthiramati]	1
[1] He states the characteristic of the totality. The term samgraha-lakṣaṇam	1
may be resolved as a karmadhāraya compound, i.e.]: the totality itself is the character-	1
istic, or (as a tatpuruşa]: the characteristic of the totality, i.e. that by which the totality is	1
characterized. And why is it mentioned? Because it was stated in the above that there	1
exists just the 'bare' imagination of what is unreal devoid of the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject. Furthermore, the three natures are taught in other Sutras, hence,	1
in order to demonstrate that there is no contradiction with other Sütras, their totality is	1
described here. This is why the author of the commentary says: ...when there is	1
the 'bare' imagination of what is unreal126	1

Although both the apprehended object and apprehending subject¹27 are unreal because	1
they are empty of own-being, on account of the fact that the latter is imagined to exist,	1
it is described as imaginary ¹28. Moreover, although this does not exist substantially,	1
[the imaginary] is described as a 'nature' since it exists in conventional expression. The	1
other-dependent [nature] is subject to others because its arising is dependent on causes	1
and conditions. It is said:	1
duality	0
It is non-imaginary, is produced from con-	1
ditions and is inexpressible in every respect	1
- because the other-dependent nature is the	1

The perfected nature is the absence of the duality on the part of the imagination of the	1
unreal because it is unconditioned and because it is perfected on account of being	1
devoid of change. It is said:	1
That absolute emptiness of the imaginary	1
nature on the part of that [other-dependent	1
nature] is the perfected nature, the sphere of	1
direct intuition free from conceptual differ-	0

"""On account of the object"" [means]: owing to the influence of the object; the same is to"	1
"be stated with regard to the [other two statements from verse 1.5]: ""on account of the"	1
"imagination of what is unreal"", and ""on account of the non-existence of the duality""."	1
[2] The object consists in the imaginary nature130; in this context131 the object	1
refers to form etc., sight etc., self and representations; and since it is non-existent in the	1
imagination of the unreal in a nature that is imaginary, being non-existent132, it is	1
described as the imaginary nature. It is said:	1
Conceptual differentiation devoid of con-	0
ceptual differentiation¹ 133 is imagined by	1
another conceptual differentiation; its nature	1
here which is imagined by another concep-	0
tual differentiation, does not exist.	1
The imagination of what is unreal consists in the other-dependent	1
nature; it is other-dependent since it depends on, or is produced by, other causes and	1
conditions but does not exist in itself. The non-existence of the apprehended	1
object and apprehending subject consists in the perfected nature; it is	1
described as perfected because it is perfected insofar as it consists in both perfection	1
devoid of change and perfection devoid of erroneous inversion.	1
[3] For, in this context, the absence of the duality on the part of the imagination of the	1
unreal is described as the non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject, but not merely the non-existence of the duality. Thus, it is just the imagination	1
of the unreal that is other-dependent because it depends upon causes and conditions.	1
The latter also is imaginary because it manifests in the natures of the apprehended	1
object and apprehending subject which are non-existent in themselves. The latter is	1
also perfected because of its absence of the apprehended object and apprehending	1

Now he reveals the characteristic of the expedient for entry into the	1
characteristic of non-existence in regard to that imagination of what is	1
unreal.	1

Based upon the perception of representation-only, the non-percep-	1
tion of the object originates. Based upon the non-perception of the	1
object, the non-perception of representation-only originates as well. In	1
this way, one	1
enters the characteristic of the non-existence of the	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1

Consequently, it is proven that the	1
own-being of perception is non-	1
perception;	1
Because, in the absence of the object to be perceived, perception is	0
not tenable.	1
Therefore, it should be known that	1
non-perception and perception are	1
equivalent.	1
Because perception is not proven to be perception but is described as	1
perception insofar as it consists in the appearance of an unreal object,	1
although it has non-perception for its own-being.	1
134 Tib. is slightly different; cf. Y's fns.3 & 4, p.23.Y23.19	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Since the characteristic of non-existence has not been clearly comprehended, the	1
imagination of what is unreal leads to 135 the defilements of moral defilement, karma	1
and rebirth. Consequently, in order to clearly comprehend the characteristic of non-	1
existence, and in order to demonstrate the expedient for that¹36, he says:	1
Based upon perception etc.	0
1.6 a	1
Since it is indicated implicitly within the imagination of the unreal, or rather since it is	1
the imagination of the unreal, the characteristic of non-existence is that very non-exist-	1
ence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject the entry into that is	0
[equivalent to] its understanding. The expedient for the latter is that through which one	1
enters the characteristic of non-existence. Moreover, this consists in a twofold skill,	1
i.e. a special basis 137 for the application to penetrate 138 the all-pervading sense of the	1
dharmadhātu. This verse was articulated in order to indicate [all] this implicitly.	1
[2] Based upon 139 the perception of representation-only, the non-	1
perception of the object originates. This absence of an objective support is the	1
fact of representation-only; [consciousness] 140 arises in the appearance of form etc. due	1
to the maturation of the individual 'seed' However, since there is no object consisting	1
in form etc., one thus enters the non-perception of the apprehended object based	1
upon¹41 the perception of the apprehending subject.	1
[3] It should be deliberated upon in this way: consciousness 142, whether in the process	1
of arising, or, already arisen, would depend upon a sense-object. In this respect, to	1
depend upon a sense-object while in the process of arising is not tenable because	1
[consciousness] does not [yet] exist when it is in the process of arising. Nor does it	1
exist when it has already arisen because it arises in the nature of the appearance of a	1
sense-object; and since there is no other activity143 on the part of consciousness with	1
the exception of its arising in the nature of the appearance of the sense-object, it is said	1
that consciousness depends upon the sense-object while performing144 that activity.	1
[4] Alternatively, if the functioning of the objective support [occurs when conscious-	1
ness is already present and not when it is in the process of arising, then consciousness	1
does not arise 145 with the objective support for its causal condition. This hypothesis is	1

meaningless, for, if there is the 'seizing' of an objective support that exists, that would	0
annul the theory of momentariness146, and in the absence of an exceptional nature, like	1
in the latter case, the 'seizing' of the objective support by consciousness is not tenable.	1
Or else ¹47, it is considered to have an exceptional nature at the time of the 'seizing' of	1
the objective support even so, due to the observation of an exceptional nature only in	1
the other case, it is concluded that [consciousness] 'seizes' only the other objective	1
support that has already arisen.	0
[5] Another [school] believes that only the object that ceases to exist [from moment to	1
moment] is the causal condition that is the objective support for consciousness while in	1
the process of arising and that this is distinguished from the [three] other causal condi-	1
tions by the fact that it is the cause of consciousness148 in the appearance of individual	1
aspects. Thereby, either atoms of form etc., or a collection of them, is imagined to be	1
the objective support although, in both cases, the objective support does not exist	0
because all consciousnesses arise in the appearances of jars and clothes etc., but not in	1
the appearances of atoms. Moreover, consciousness appearing as one thing in the	1
aspect of the object cannot have an objective support which is different 149, since even	1
sight and the other [sense faculties] would be objective supports. Moreover, one may	1
believe that an accumulation of atoms forms the objective support but the individual	1
[atoms] do not this is also a non-argument, for although they may be accumulated	1
they can only be considered as objective supports individually not as an accumu-	1
lation. With regard to the latter [view], consciousness 150 does not arise in the indi-	1
vidual appearances of atoms, for [it arises] in the appearance of an accumulation of	1
them; therefore the notion] that atoms form an objective support is not possible. Nor	1
is the objective support a collection of atoms because causality is not possible on the	1
part of that which has [only] nominal existence, because like the immediately preced-	1
ing-causal condition etc. 151, the objective support-causal condition is also considered to	1
be the cause of consciousness. Therefore, it is not possible that something that ceases	1
to exist [from moment to moment] can be the objective support-causal condition ¹52.	1
Likewise, if that which has actually ceased to exist forms the objective support¹53, this	1

being so, then past and the future [time] would be sense-objects and it has been proven	0
that consciousness is devoid of the sense-object in dreams etc.	1
[6] Some believe 154 that the consciousness in dreams etc. is not without an objective	1
support because it has the sign (nimitta) for its objective support. But, the sign is the	1
reflected image of the object which has the dissociated formative forces for its own-	1
being, for if the object does not exist in dreams etc., [the existence of its sign is not	1
tenable, like in the absence of a face etc., its reflection cannot be established 155.	1
[Response]: Consciousness, whether in the process of arising or already arisen, does	1
not have the sign for its objective support because both its non-existence and cessation	1
have already been described. Consciousness itself consists in the reflection of the	1
object because of the fact that it is an appearance of the object, hence it is not tenable	1
that the sign has the nature of the dissociated 156 formative forces. Moreover,	1
consciousness is to be admitted necessarily as possessing the aspect of the object, for if	1
it were without aspect, one could not determine the apprehended object and appre-	1
hending subject.	1
[7] However, others believe that non-resistant [i.e. transparent] matter forms the	1
objective support in a dream and in the [meditative contemplation] of ascetics upon	1
impure things etc.; but [the notion that] the latter are non-resistant and belong to the	1
domain of mind alone is contradicted by the fact that they have colour and shape etc.	1
Also, non-resistant matter other than mere non-information (avijñapti) is not taught in	1
the sästras; therefore this is no more than a hypothesis.	1
[8] Others again consider that the object of past experience forms the sense-object of	1
consciousness in a dream because there is no perception of the colour blue etc. in	1
dreams for one who is born blind. [Response]: It is not that one who is blind from	1
birth does not perceive colour in dreams, rather, because [the object's] conventional	1
symbol has not been explained to him, he does not know it by name and hence cannot	1
communicate it to others. Moreover, if it is only what has been experienced [in the	1
past] that one sees in a dream, then why is it not considered that one who is blind from	1
birth also does not see colour, for colour certainly was perceived by such a person in	1
previous lives¹57? Also, it is not that only what is perceived in the present life appears	1
in a dream, for there no distinction whatever between one who sleeps and one who	1
is awake in relation to past, future and present experience. Therefore, it is purely	1
hypothetical to assert that consciousness ¹58 has an object of past experience as its	1

sense-object in a dream. Moreover, because the past [experience] is non-existent it is	0
certain that consciousness, although devoid of a sense-object, arises in the appearance	1
of the object in a dream. Thus, [the notion of] the non-perception of the sense-object is	1
cultivated because its perception [occurs] as a mental representation-only.	1
[9] Based upon the non-perception of the object 59, the non-perception	1
of representation-only originates as well. Just as one enters the non-existence	1
of the apprehended object¹60 through the force of representation-only, since the imagi-	1
nary apprehended object does not exist externally to consciousness; similarly, one	1
understands the non-existence of representation-only too through the force of the non-	1
existence of the apprehended object. It is not tenable that the apprehending subject	1
exists if the apprehended object does not exist because the determination of the	1
subjectivity of that is dependent upon objectivity. In this way, one enters the	1
characteristic of the non-existence of the apprehended object and appre-	1
hending subject which have an imaginary nature; however, [the entry into the	1
characteristic of the non-existence] of the imagination of what is unreal has not been	1
shown¹61.	1
[10] What then is the reason that just the non-existence of representation-only was not	1
determined 162 from the very beginning? [Response]: Because the apprehending	1
subject is dependent upon the apprehended object when the object to be supported	1
does not exist one easily enters [the non-existence of representation-only] due to the	1
destruction of the entity which has the nature of the objective support163. Otherwise	1
there would be a definite negation 164 of existence because the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject would be devoid of the relation of mutual dependence. At the	1
conclusion of the first immeasurable aeon [the bodhisattva), progressing without inter-	1
ruption in the accumulations [of merit and direct intuition] enters this level of direct	1
intuition which transcends the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object¹65	1
and apprehending subject. Thus, while cultivating l 166 the non-existence of form etc.	1
based upon this [doctrine of] representation-only, he realizes the meditative concen-	0
tration known as the state of heat (ușmagata), together with its peripheral elements	1
This is the essential nature of the first [stage] of the supramundane path. Following	0

from this [comes the concentration] known as the summit (mürdhan); Immediately	0
after that comes the concentration known as receptivity to knowledge (kṣãnu) which is	1
conducive to the non-perception of the apprehender and is due to the non-perception of	1
the apprehended object in its entirety. Immediately after that, based upon the non-per-	1
ception of the object, while cultivating167 the non-perception of even representation-	1
only 168, [the bodhisattva], in accompaniment with wisdom etc., realizes the meditative	0
concentration known as the highest mundane experience (laukikägryadharma) together	1
with its peripheral elements. Immediately after that [he attains] the path of vision and it	1
is only here that he enters the first spiritual level due to his understanding of the all-	1
pervading dharmadhātu. This is a mental attention directed towards reality; it is not a	1
mental attention towards firm conviction 169 like the [four] immeasurables are.	1
[11] In order to demonstrate the fact that perception has non-perception for its own-	1
being, he says:	1
1.7 ab	0
Consequently, it is proven that the	1
own-being of perception is non-	1
perception;	1
1.7 cd	0
Alternatively, that which was previously asserted, that the duality does not exist in the	1
imagination of what is unreal, has been proven because it is introspectively knowable	1
"in this aspect. It is in order to demonstrate this that he says: ""consequently, it is proven"	1
"that the own-being of perception is non-perception"". Consequently, i.e. because"	1
there can be no perception if there is no object to be perceived 170. The term 'perception'	1
could be construed as any one of: (a) a state, (b) an agent, or (c) an instrument;	1
however this trio is not tenable due to the non-existence of an objective referent171	1
"(karma) - ""consequently, it is proven that the own-being of perception is non-percep-"	1
"tion"". This is why the author of the commentary says: because, in the absence of"	1
the object to be perceived, perception is not tenable.	1
Therefore, it should be known that	1
non-perception and perception are	1
equivalent.	1
Since perception has non-perception for its own-being, therefore they are the same; i.e.	1
the fact that they are equivalent should be known because there is no difference insofar	1
as there is neither the non-perception of the object nor is there perception consisting in	1
representation-only. In order to remove mutual contradiction between the words	1
'perception' and 'non-perception', he says: ...but is described as perception	1

insofar as it consists in the appearance of an unreal object; but since	0
nothing is perceived by that [perception] because of the absence of the object, hence,	1
there is no contradiction in an absolute sense because he says: ...although having	1
non-perception for its own-being172.	1
[13] Others say that on the one hand there is the perception of the object173 by naive	1
people, although there is no object, and on the other hand there is the non-perception of	1
the object by the Noble Ones; both of these should be known to be the same because	1
their characteristics are equivalent, like in the [perception and] non-perception of an	1
"erroneous snake. This is why he says: ""...but is described as perception insofar as it"	1
consists in the appearance of an unreal object, although having non-perception for its	1
"own-being 174"", like in the statement about the non-perception of an erroneous snake."	1
[14] Others again say that on the one hand there is the perception of the apprehending	1
subject by naive people; and on the other hand there is the non-perception of the appre-	1
hending subject by the Noble Ones, because of the absence of the object. Although in	1
the two cases both perception and non-perception should be known to be the same	1
because there is no difference insofar as there is no apprehender if there is no appre-	1
"hended object. This is why he says: ""...insofar as it consists in the appearance of an"	1
"unreal object""."	1
[15] However, others believe that in order to counteract imputation and negation he	1
"says: ""therefore, it should be known that non-perception and perception are equiva-"	1
"lent"", i.e. because of the absence of the object and since perception175 does not have the"	1
essential nature of perception, it is described as not having such an essential nature.	1
[Response]: [The notion] that perception has perception for its essential nature is not	1
excluded 176, nor is it interpolated that it has non-perception for its essential nature. 177	1
What is it then? Both of them are the same owing to the absence of conceptual differ-	1
entiation. Therefore, regardless of imputation and negation, the fact that there is intro-	1
spective equality on the part of both non-perception and perception should be known.	1

Now he states the characteristic of the differentiation of that imagin-	1
ation of what is unreal.	1
1.8 ab	1
The Characteristic of the Differentiation.	1
The imagination of what is unreal	1
consists in the mind and the mental	1
According to their differentiation among the spheres of sense-desire,	0
form or formlessness.	0
concomitants that pertain to the three	0
realms of existence.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y29.14 [1] He states the characteristic of the differentiation. There are various	1
modes of differentiation of the imagination of the unreal as being of the nature of ¹81 the	1
realms of sense-desire, form and formlessness. Since the differentiation itself is the	1
characteristic, it is the characteristic of the differentiation [i.e. the term prabheda-	1
lakṣaṇam is a karmadhāraya compound] because the imagination of the unreal is char-	1
acterized by this differentiation ¹82. What is the reason that the characteristic of the	1
differentiation is declared? Because the (existence of the] realms of sense-desire and	1
form is not tenable if there is just the imagination of what is unreal. [If] the differen-	1
tiation of Noble Ones and ordinary people etc. is not made according to the differen-	1
tiation183 of realms of existence as the result of the differences in the adverse elements	1
and their counteragents, there would be a great calamity on the part of the teachings;	1
[hence], in order to dispel such a fear, the characteristic of the differentiation is stated.	1

[2] Alternatively, some believe that the imagination of what is unreal is found only	1
where184 there is conjecture and deliberation and not otherwise; hence, in order to reject	1
such a [notion], the characteristic of the differentiation is mentioned.	1
1.8 ab	1
The imagination of what is unreal	1
consists in the mind and the mental	1
concomitants that pertain to the three	0
realms of existence.	1
But not just where there is conjecture and deliberation. Just as form refers to the	1
primary 185 and secondary elementary matter; similarly, the imagination of what is	1
unreal also refers to both mind and the mental concomitants and not just to mind alone.	1
Moreover, these are the own-being of the three realms of existence, i.e. they pertain to	1
the three realms according to their differentiation!!	1
186 among the spheres of	0
sense-desire, form and formlessness. The realm of sense-desire therein refers	1
to the twenty 187 modes [of existence] in the aspects of the narakas etc. which manifest	1
from that unreal imagination. The realm of form refers to the seventeen modes [of	1
existence] in the aspects of the brahmakãyika etc. The formless realm refers to the four	1
modes [of existence] in the aspects of the ākäśānantyāyatana etc.	1
[3] However, another says that the realm of sense-desire 188 refers to those who belong	1
to the sphere of sense-desire189, i.e. whose passion for sense-desire has not been relin-	1
quished and whose notions about form have not been abrogated. The realm of form	1
refers to those who belong to the sphere of form190, i.e. whose passion for sense-	1
desire has been relinquished and whose notions about form have not been abrogated.	1
The formless realm 191 refers to those who belong to the sphere of formlessness 192, i.e.	1
whose passion for sense-desire has been relinquished and whose notions about form	1
have been abrogated 193.	1
[4] Others believe that the realm of sense-desire refers to those with a propensity for	1
the passion of sense-desire, the realm of form refers to those with a propensity for the	1
passion of form and the formless realm refers to those with a propensity for the	1
passion of formlessness.	1

[5] Others believe that the realm of sense-desire refers to those who are constantly	1
distracted and have become the basis of [special] sorts of mental dissatisfaction. The	1
realm of form refers to those who are meditatively composed and whose modes of	1
mental dissatisfaction have been dispelled. The formless realm refers to those who are	1
meditatively composed and whose modes of pleasure and dissatisfaction have been	1
relinquished.	1
[6] Others again believe that the realm of sense-desire refers to those who have not	1
relinquished odours and tastes and their appearances in consciousness. The realm of	1
form refers to those who have relinquished both odours and tastes and their appear-	1
ances in consciousness. The formless realm refers to those who have relinquished the	1
appearances of the fifteen elements.	1
[7] Which is most relevant among all these explanations? It is only necessary that	1
what was described in the first explanation be mentioned since the [subsequent}	1
explanations are only correlative to it. This is a further reference to the imagination of	1
what is unreal in the chapter on unreal imagination because it was interrupted by [the	1
explanation of non-perception.	1
f. The Characteristic of its Synonyms.	1
He states the characteristic of the synonyms:	1
1.8 cd	0
Vision in regard to the object con-	1
sists in consciousness, but in regard	1
to its particulars, it consists in the	1
mental concomitants.	0
Therein, vision in regard to the object alone consists in conscious-	1
ness; vision in regard to the particulars of the object consists in the	1
mental concomitants, such as sensation.	0
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] He states the characteristic of the synonyms194. By demonstrating the	1
particulars as belonging to the mind and the mental concomitants 195, he states the char-	1
acteristic of the synonyms of the imagination of what is unreal. How so? Because the	1
mind and the mental concomitants manifest as imaginative constructions in regard to	1
194 Read: paryayalakṣaṇam ca khyāpayatīti in place of paryayalakṣaṇam ceti; Tib, mam grans kyi	0
mtshan ñid kyań ston te (D204a.6). Cf. Bhäşya N20.17.	1
Read: cittacaittaviseșapradarśanena in place of cittacaittanam prabhedam pradarsayitvä; Tib. sems	1
dan sems las byun ba mams kyi bye brag rab tu bstan pas (D204a.6).Y32	1
both the own-being and the particular of an unreal¹96 entity that is to be imaginatively	0
constructed. Since the vision197 of an object's essential nature and particulars consists	1
in both the mental concomitants and unreal imagination they are included as synonyms,	1
however, the particular does not exist in the object.	1
[2] Therein, the vision in regard to the object alone198 consists in con-	1
sciousness. The word 'alone' is for the purpose of excluding the particulars 199; what	1
is meant is: the perception of just the essential nature of an entity the particulars are	1
not 'seized'. Vision in regard to the particulars of the object200 consists in	1
the mental concomitants, such as sensation; because they function with regard	0
to that [i.e. the object]201 in various particular forms. In this regard, the particulars of	1
joyfulness or sorrow can pertain to an entity and the 'seizing' of the condition of well-	0
being etc. belonging to that is 'sensation' (vedana). The particular of an object is the	1
sign202 which consists in a conventional expression, such as 'man' or 'woman' and its	1
apprehension is 'ideation' (samjña). The other respective [mental concomitants) should	1
also be construed in this way. Thus these203 are associated by having the same nature	1
in regard to (a) basis, (b) objective support, (c) time and (d) substance, but not by	1
having the same nature in regard to aspect too, because it would be non-distinguishable	1
from consciousness.	1
[3] Some [schools] understand that it is just the special modes of mind (cittaviseșa)	1
that are intended as the mental concomitants in this context and that same conscious-	1
ness arises in variegated appearances, like the eyes on a peacock's tail, in forms etc. that	1
are similar204. [Objection]: How can it be both singular and variegated since, with	1
regard to a singular entity 205, the world does not accept a variety of [incompatible]206	1
characteristics? Otherwise it would be said that a singular entity has a manifold own-	1
being. [Response]: This fault would apply if the own-being of a dharma were per-	1
"fected, but this fault does not relate to 'bare' error because of the statement: ""because it"	1
"does not exist as such, nor is it non-existent in every respect""; (I.4 c). [Objection]:"	1
"This is not so because it contradicts this statement from a Sutra: ""these dharmas known"	1
as sensation (vedanā), ideation (samjñā), mind (citta) and consciousness (vijñāna) are	1
mixed together they are not discrete; and close-contact (samsarga) indeed belongs to	1

g. The Actualizing Characteristic.	0
Next he states the actualizing characteristic:	1
1.9 abcd	1
The first is consciousness as causal	1
condition; the second pertains to	1
sense-experience; the mental con-	1
comitants therein are sense-experi-	1
ence, discrimination and stimulation.	1
Consciousness as causal condition is the store-consciousness since	1
Actual con-	0
it is the causal condition for the other consciousnesses.	0
sciousness, which pertains to sense-experience, has the latter for its	0
causal condition. Sense-experience refers to sensation. Discrimination	1
refers to ideation. The stimulations refer to the formative forces of	1
consciousness volition and mental attention etc.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y32.10 [1] In order to demonstrate that when there is the 'bare' imagination of the unreal and	1
nothing else, its differentiation as cause and result is not discerned, [hence] he states	1
the actualizing characteristic. It is a characteristic since the imagination of the	0
unreal [is characterized] as cause and result on account of this. [Since] the actualizing	1
itself is the characteristic, it is the actualizing characteristic [i.e. the term pravṛtti-	1
lakṣaṇam is a karmadhāraya compound). Furthermore, this actualization209 is twofold:	1
(a) the actualization as a regular succession of momentary instants under the influence	1
of which there is the defilement of sense-experience in the present lifetime and (b) the	1
actualization as another rebirth under the influence of which there is the defilement of	1
moral defilement, karma and rebirth, in the future. The actualization as a regular	1
succession of momentary instants in this context is described as the actualizing charac-	1
teristic. The actualization as another rebirth will be stated as the characteristic of	1
defilement [in the next section].	1

209 Ms.(9b.3): pravŢttiḥ, disregard Y's fn.4 p.32.Y33	1
1.9 a	1
The first is consciousness as causal	1
condition etc.	1
"In the above, ""the first"" refers to the store-consciousness210. Since it is the cause, i.e."	1
the basic causal condition (hetupratyaya), of the remaining seven consciousnesses, it is	1
consciousness as causal condition.	1
1.9 b	1
The second pertains to sense-	1
experience.	1
"The word ""consciousness"" remains in force [from the preceding sentence]. The"	1
ellipsis is: it is the result of the latter [i.e. the store-consciousness]; moreover, it is	1
sevenfold. The actual consciousness pertains to sense-experience because it has sense-	1
experiencing for its purpose.	1
1.9 cd	1
The mental concomitants therein are	1
sense-experience, discrimination and	0
stimulation.211	1
It is the fact that the mental concomitants therein, i.e. in consciousness, are also the	1
result of that [store-consciousness) that is referred to because they are [constituents of]	1
consciousness and because they share its attainments and protection as one.	1
[2] Consciousness as causal condition is the store-consciousness since	1
it is the basic causal condition for the other consciousnesses212. It is	1
[described as] a store-house (ālaya) since, in its mode as result, all impure213 dharmas	1
are collected (aliyante) there, and, in its mode as cause, it collects in them. It is con-	1
sciousness because it causes the representation of the world of sentient beings and	1
inanimate things through appearing as such; moreover, because it consists exclusively	1
in the karma result, it is undefined. It is consciousness as causal condition since it is	1
the basic causal condition for both the 'seeds' of all impure dharmas that follow in	1
consequence of it214 and for the other actual consciousnesses. Actual conscious-	1
ness, which pertains to sense-experience, has the latter for its causal	1
condition; what is meant is: since it arises (pratyeti) from that store-consciousness, it	1
is produced with the latter for its causal condition (tatpratyaya). How does arise?	1
The actual consciousness, while in the process of manifesting from the store-	1
consciousness, fosters in that store-consciousness a 'seed' which is the progenitor of an	1
actual consciousness which has not yet arisen and which is of the same genre. [Then]	1

an actual consciousness of the same genre is produced again from that matured 'seed'	0
which has undergone a special transformation215. Thus, that actual consciousness216	1
has that [store-consciousness] for its causal condition²17.	1
[3] [Objection]: Is it not so that218 the store-consciousness also pertains to sense-	1
experience, and the actual consciousness can be [construed as the consciousness as	1
causal condition because [the store-consciousness] is the basis of the sense-experience	1
of non-painful and non-pleasurable sensations and also because the latent impressions	1
are activated219 in the store-consciousness? There is no other activation of the latent	1
impressions 220	1
except as causal conditions, as has been stated in this verse from the	0
Abhidharmasutra:221	1
All dharmas are collected in consciousness,	1
and likewise the latter in the former as	1
result and cause of each other, eternally.	0
[Response]: It need not lead to this conclusion. Why?222 Because of the difficulty in	1
distinguishing the sensation that belongs to it, [the store-consciousness] is not recog-	1
nized as being pertinent to sense-experience, like actual consciousness is, or it should	1
be known as something pre-eminent, like the sun. Accordingly, only actual	1
consciousness is the basis for the sense-experience of the three kinds of sensation - the	1
store-consciousness is not. Moreover, in this context [the store consciousness] is	1
intended as the basic causal condition, not just a causal condition. Likewise, under the	1
influence of wholesome and unwholesome dharmas, the store consciousness incor-	1
porates the latent impressions consisting in both the karma-result and the natural	1
outcome-result, whereas 223, under the influence of the undefined dharmas (it incor-	1
porates] only the latent impressions that belong to the natural outcome-result. Hence	1
the store consciousness is the basic causal condition for all impure dharmas in their	1
entirety. However, actual consciousness is the predominant causal condition for the	1
store consciousness it is not the basic causal condition224. Thus, that the actual	1
consciousness is a causal condition is not a [wrong) conclusion.	1

[4] Sense-experience refers to sensation; It is [described as] sense-experience	1
since just the three modes [of sensation] are 'partaken of 225, what is ant is: they are	1
experienced. Sensation is like the essence of the flavour of existence. Due to the latter,	1
naive people are attached to sense-objects226 for the sake of the full sensory experience	1
of them. Others believe that sense-experience refers not just to sensation but also to	1
the perception of objects, but this is not so because it is in contradiction with	1
"[Vasubandhu's] commentary which states: ""sense-experience refers to sensation""."	1
Moreover, since the perception of an object is not different from consciousness, it	1
would not be logically tenable227 that it can be a mental concomitant. The discrimi-	1
nation of what has been sensed refers to ideation, because it consists in the appre-	1
hension of the particulars, such as what is pleasurable. The stimulations towards	1
sense-experience and ideation refer to the formative forces of conscious-	1
ness 228, volition and mental attention etc.	1
"[5] Alternatively, he says: ""sense-experience refers to sensation"", because one experi-"	1
ences an objective support according to its nature; and because one experiences the	1
karma of what is to be sensed as pleasure etc. Thus229, since sensation consists in the	1
sensory experience of both sense-objects and their karma, it is sense-experience.	1
Discrimination refers to ideation since it discriminates the mark (cihna) of the sense-	1
object, i.e. its conventional sign (vyavahära-nimitta). The stimulations towards differ-	1
ent objective supports on the part of consciousness are the formative forces 230; hence,	1
through the influence of volition etc., consciousness partakes of a different objective	1
"support 231. Will-power and the like are referred to by the term ""etc.""."	0

ing and (h) attracting;	1
(i) Fettering, (j) directing and (k)	1
suffering the world is defiled.	0
In the above: (a) it is due to concealing, because of the obstruction	1
of [one's] vision [of phenomena] as they are in reality, by ignorance.	1
(b) It is due to implanting, because of the establishment of the latent	1
impressions of karma in consciousness, by the formative forces. (c) It	1
is due to conducting, because it is made to reach the place of rebirth, by	1
consciousness. (d) It is due to encapsulating, of the individual nature	1
by name form. (e) It is due to completing, by the six sense-fields. (f)	1
It is due to threefold discriminating, by contact. (g) It is due to sense-	1
experiencing, through sensation. (h) It is due to the attracting, of the	1
new existence projected through karma, by craving. (i) It is due to the	1
fettering, of consciousness to the sense-desires etc. that are conducive	1
to rebirth, through the graspings. (j) It is due to directing, because the	1
karma that has been performed is directed towards the provision of the	1
karma-result in the new existence, by becoming. (k) It is due to	0
suffering that the world is completely defiled, by birth, old-age and	1
death. This:	1
Threefold, twofold and sevenfold	0
defilement [manifests] from the	0
imagination of what is unreal.	1
Defilement is threefold: the defilement of moral defilement, the	1
defilement of karma and the defilement of rebirth. Of these, the defile-	1
ment of moral defilement consists in ignorance, craving and grasping.	1
The defilement of karma consists in the formative forces and becoming.	1
The defilement of rebirth consists in the remaining [seven] elements.	1
Defilement is twofold: defilement as cause and defilement as result.	1
Of these, the defilement as cause includes those elements which have	1
moral defilement and karma for their own-being. Defilement as result	0
includes the remaining [elements].Y35.6	1
Sevenfold defilement refers to the seven types of causes: (a) the	1
cause of erroneous inversion, (b) the cause of projection, (c) the cause	1
of leading, (d) the cause of possession, (e) the cause of sense-experi-	1
ence, (f) the cause of attraction and (g) the cause of anxiety233. Of	1
these, the cause of erroneous inversion is ignorance. The cause of	1
projection is the formative forces. The cause of leading is conscious-	1
ness. The cause of possession is name / form and the six sense-fields.	1
The cause of sense-experience is contact and sensation. The cause of	1
attraction is craving, grasping and becoming. The cause of anxiety is	1
birth, old-age and death. And all of these defilements manifest from the	1
imagination of what is unreal.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Now he states the characteristic234 of defilement. The characteristic of	1
defilement refers to that mode in which the defilements of moral defilement, karma and	1
rebirth, while in the process of manifesting, lead to the complete defilement of the	1
world. Although it is insubstantial 235, samsāra is generated just from the imagination	1
of what is unreal. In order to demonstrate this it is stated:	1
I.10 ab	1
Due to: (a) concealing, (b) implant-	1
ing, (c) conducting, . (d) encapsulat-	1
ing etc.	1
These twelve elements of dependent origination are shown with reference to 236 the	1
actualizing side [of consciousness).	0
[2] In the above, it is due to concealing, ...that the world is defiled; the	1
"latter portion of this statement [i.e. ""the world is defiled""] refers to all [twelve"	1
elements]. How is it that [the world] is defiled due to concealing and by what is it con-	1
cealed? Hence he says: because of the obstruction of [one's] vision [of	1
phenomena] as they are in reality, by ignorance. Since ignorance237 consists	1
in the absence of vision, when the sphere of one's vision of reality is hidden, the vision	1
of what is real does not arise. Consequently, because it obstructs the arising of one's	1
vision of the real, ignorance is an obstruction to [the arising of the vision of what is	1
real; furthermore, the vision of the real consists chiefly in supramundane wisdom. The	1
latter, which is subsequently attained because it arises subsequently [to the path of	1
vision] and which consists in learning, reflection and meditative development which	1

Because it obstructs the vision of what is real, ignorance is described as the causal	1
"condition for the formative forces, thus it is said: ""due to concealing by ignorance, the"	1
"world is defiled""."	1
[3] It is due to implanting; that the world is defiled - this is understood. As to the	1
agent, locus and object of implanting, he says: of the latent impressions of	1
karma in consciousness, by the formative forces. Therein, the formative	1
forces consist in karma of body, speech and mind and its essential nature can be vir-	1
tuous, non-virtuous or neutral. It is a formative force (samskāra) since it formatively	1
influences (abhisamskaroti) the new existence; what meant is: it implants what was	1
not previously implanted 239; it is just this [sense that is expressed by the term	1
"""formative force"", but not all [its meanings]. Moreover, since they have the capacity to"	1
project the new existence because of the influence of ignorance240 and not merely on	1
account of their existence, it is said that the formative forces have ignorance for their	1
causal condition. Accordingly, they bring about the new existence for one whose	1
knowledge 241 has not yet arisen, but not for one whose knowledge has arisen. Ignor-	1
ance is not described as the causal condition for the formative forces merely as the	1
predominant [causal condition] because it is the general causal condition in the	1
manifestation [of the new existence] as well, for ignorance is likewise associated with	1
all moral defilement. Just as it is the causal condition in general for the arising of the	1
moral defilements that do arise242, so too is it (the causal condition] for the volitions	1
which arise243 from the latter. Even when the [meritorious 1244 formative forces mani-	1
fest, i.e. those that follow as a consequence of the genuine wish for245 the special states	1
of existence and enjoyments, ignorance which is innate to them246, is their general	1
causal condition. Also, [when there is the arising] of neutral247 [formative forces] that	1
arise 248 with the notion that one can escape to those levels 249, ignorance, which is	1

innate to them 250, is their general251 causal condition. Thus it is described as the causal	0
condition for the formative forces. In the above, the store-consciousness is intended	1
"by the term: ""consciousness"", and not the actual consciousness because of the impossi-"	1
bility of being conveyed to the place of rebirth by the actual consciousness whose	1
continuity is interrupted 252, and also because the latent impressions of karma are not	1
established therein by the formative forces since both the wholesome and defiled	1
"[dharmas] cannot be brought together. When [Vasubandhu] says: ""[it is due to the"	0
"implanting] of the latent impressions of karma..."", just what is this that is described as"	1
the latent impression of karma? It is the 'seed' of the future birth253, i.e. a causal entity.	1
For example, a grain of rice is the seed, i.e. the causal entity, for the arising of a sprout	1
[which develops] through a transformation in dependence upon special conditions such	1
as soil, ash and manure. Because of the establishment...; this term expresses	1
"implanting again through a different synonym. Furthermore, ""establishment"" in this"	0
context refers to the augmentation of that 'seed' in the continuum of consciousness	1
from the very beginning254, by these [formative forces]; for, no previously non-	1
existent 'seed' of any dharma that is accompanied by impurity is generated, like in the	1
case of one without impurity. In this way, the world is defiled due to the generation of	1
the 'seed' of the new existence in consciousness, by the formative forces.	1
[4] It is due to conducting; that the world is defiled. Since the agent, locus and	1
object of conducting is not discerned, he says:. because it is made to reach255 the	1
place of rebirth256, by consciousness. Conducting refers to the conveying of	1
the latent impressions of the 'seed' of the new existence, from the place of death to the	1
place of rebirth, by consciousness which is fully developed by karma and which	1
functions as a continuum 257. After considering it in this way258, then the conscious-	1
ness at conception cannot have the formative forces for its causal condition; and it has	1
been demonstrated that only the consciousness belonging to the previous existence has	1
the formative forces for its causal condition, because the arising of an effect from a	0
cause that has perished is not tenable. Since those who have gained the formless	1
attainments are reborn in that very place where they die, how can they be conveyed to a	1
place of rebirth in the formless [realms]? [Rather] it should be understood according to	1
the circumstances, as is the case with name / form.	1

[5] It is due to encapsulating259; that the world is defiled. As to the agent,	1
locus 260 and object of encapsulation261, he says: of the individual nature, by	1
name form. Because name / form are [equivalent to the five aggregates. The	0
latter, after appropriating conception, while in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth	0
stages of embryonic development262, and before the six sense-fields have arisen,	1
comprise name / form which have consciousness for their causal condition. Thus, the	0
differentiation into different homogeneous groups is accomplished through a special	1
activation within that [name / form]. And when the latter have arisen, their individual	1
nature is differentiated due to the difference in homogeneous groups, such as between	1
human and animal; thus it is said that the individual nature is encapsulated by name /	1
form. Alternatively, it envelops the whole individual nature up until death263 because	1
the whole is determined as a causal state from the beginning. Or else, although it is not	1
differentiated264, the individual nature is enveloped by name / form, thus he shows it to	1
be separate; just as everything conditioned is included in the five aggregates [yet are	1
separate from them]; however, only 265 the sense-fields of creatures of miraculous birth	1
(aupapăduka) have consciousness for their causal condition266 (and not name / form].	1
Consequently, it should be known that name / form have consciousness for their causal	1
condition, according to the circumstances.	0
[6] It is due to completion; that [the world] is defiled 267. As to the agent, locus268	1
and object of completion, he says: of the individual nature which is included in name /	1
form 269, by the six sense-fields. For the individual nature 270 is described as	1
incomplete in the state of name form because of the absence of the sense-fields of	1
sight etc. Moreover, although the tactile and mind sense-fields do exist in that state,	1
they too are definitely incomplete because as a ['field' comprising] both that which is	1
based [i.e. the object of the senses] and the basis [i.e. the sense organs], it is incom-	1
plete. Furthermore, the basis271 is complete in the state of the six sense-fields because	1
of the actualization of sight etc. The tactile sense-field is also complete because of the	1

completion of sight etc. which is based on it272. How is it that sight etc. are based on	0
it273? Because their functioning depends upon it. The mind sense-field too, which is	1
included in the six consciousnesses, is completed at this time because of the completion	1
of the basis 274 in its entirety. Also, since the major and minor members [of the body]	1
are complete 275 only in the state of the six sense-fields276 because the basis is complete,	1
it is said that the world is defiled by the six sense-fields.	1
"[7] It is due to threefold discriminating; ""that the world is defiled” is under-"	1
"stood. ""Threefold"" refers to the combination of sense faculty, sense-object and"	1
consciousness. Contact refers to the discrimination of the three modes of modifi-	1
cation of the sense faculty and is conducive to the arising of the sensation of pleasure	1
etc. It is described as contact (sparśa) since it is an aspect of that likeness of modifi-	0
cation of the sense faculty which it touches (sprșati)277. Alternatively, contact which	1
has the six sense-fields for its causal condition, produces a threefold modification of	1
the sense faculty that is conducive to the sensation of pleasure etc.	1
[8] It is due to sense-experiencing278, through sensation; because sensation	1
is experienced on account of craving; what is meant is: 'consumed with relish'. Alter-	1
natively, the sense-experience of sensation is due to the experience of karma279 that is	1
virtuous etc. Alternatively, in this context sense-experience refers to the experience of	1
a sensation and when pleasure etc. is experienced, due to the full development therein	1
of [sensations] such as pleasure, the world is defiled by [subsequent] passion, hatred	1
and delusion.	1
[9] It is due to the attracting; since the agent and object of attraction are not	1
discerned, he says: of the new existence projected through karma, by crav-	1

on account of the formative forces in consciousness, by craving, which can be likened	1
to the moisture 280 [in the generation of a seed]. Then, after securing the generation of	1

[11] It is due to directing; here too when questioned by another, [Vasubandhu]	1
himself responds: because the karma that has been performed is directed	1
towards the provision of the karma-result in the new existence287, by	1
becoming. Thus, the karma performed in the past is the cause of consciousness and	1
as being pertinent to the new existence is in state of latent impression; it receives an	0
existence since the 'fruit' of the karma-result acquires a functional status and is directed	1
towards accomplishing the projection of an existence288. Thus the world is defiled due	1
to directing289, by becoming.	1
[10] It is due to the fettering; when questioned as to the agent, locus and object	1
of fettering, [Vasubandhu] himself says: of consciousness to the sense-desires	1
etc. that are conducive to rebirth282, through the graspings. Conscious-	1
ness, which is projected by karma by means of the four graspings that are char-	1
acterized by notional attachment 283 and the passion of sense-desire, is fettered to, i.e.	1
fixed in284 sense-desire, false view, morality and observances and false view of self285	1
which are conducive to rebirth because consciousness abides therein [in the new birth]	1
by force of the passion of sense-desire286,	1
[12] It is due to suffering that the world is completely defiled by birth,	1
old-age and death 290. Thus, when there is the actualization of the new existence	1
due to becoming, from the very outset [the world] is defiled as the consequence of the	1
coagulation of consciousness in semen and blood at the time of impregnation.	1
Similarly, it is defiled due to the to-and-fro movement [of the foetus] midway between	1
the stomach and the abdomen of the mother. Similarly, it is defiled because of the	1
mother's inability to dispel anxiety and anguish when eating and moving about.	1

[13] Since it is in motion (gacchati), it is [described as] the 'moving', [i.e. the world]	1
(jagat); what is meant is: it progresses from an homogeneous condition to a momentary	1
"condition. By ""it is defiled"" is meant; in [all] the three realms of existence, [the world]"	1
is afflicted on account of birth, old-age, sickness and death etc. and on account of its	1
incessant motion through a regular succession of moments. Others believe that the	1
"term ""it is defiled"" means: 'it is not purified'. Thus, these twelve elements of dependent"	1
origination which are characterized by defilement, arise on account of these eleven	1
"modes beginning with ""due to concealing"" as the direct counterpart to purification; and,"	1
beginning with ignorance, they form a sequential progression, since each subsequent	1
element is brought about by each preceding element.	1
Similarly, the world291 is defiled by coming out292 [of the womb] through a restricted	1
and impure passage. Again, the world is defiled insofar as one is born only to be	1
deprived of293 cherished youth and vitality by old-age characterized by baldness and	1
grey hair etc.294 and by death which is characterized by the dissolution295 of name /	1
form.	1

"The word ""and"" has a conjunctive and repetitive298 sense. Since moral defilement itself"	1
is defilement, it is described as the defilement of moral defilement. Similarly are the	1
defilements that consist in karma and rebirth [so-called], for moral defilement manifests	1
as defilement [in general] because it is harmful to both oneself and others; as is said in	1
"a Sutra: ""one who is enamoured 299 and overcome with passion is intent upon harming"	1
himself, is intent upon harming others and is intent upon harm in both (this and the	1

into being [only] on account of the manifestation of moral defilement and since there is	0
the bond of conception in a new existence for one whose mind is defiled, the defile-	1
ment that consists in rebirth is a cause [for the defilement of the world]. Consequently,	1
since the Arhat does not possess a defiled mind, there is no bond of conception.	1
Moreover, karma whether pure or impure is [equivalent to] defilement because it both	1
causes bodily and mental fatigue in the present301 and provides the karma-result in the	1
future. Rebirth too is [equivalent to] defilement because it is the locus of all	1
misfortune.	1
[15] Defilement is threefold; because the cause is differentiated as twofold. The	1
defilement of moral defilement consists in ignorance, craving and	1
grasping302; the latter form a trio because they have the nature of moral defilement.	1
The defilement of karma consists in the formative forces and becoming;	1
the latter form a pair because they have the nature of karma. However, there is this	1
difference: karma, in its state as essential nature consists in the formative forces, but in	1
its state as 'seed' it consists in becoming. The defilement of rebirth consists in	1
the remaining [seven] elements, i.e. consciousness, name form, the six sense-	1
fields, contact, sensation, birth, old-age and death, since these are included within	0
rebirth.	1
[16] Defilement is twofold, since the cause is not differentiated. The defile-	1
ment as cause includes those elements which have moral defilement and	1
karma for their own-being303; defilement as result includes the remain-	1
ing elements. Of these, the defilement as cause304 is pertinent to karma and moral	1
defilement because the latter are engaged in the generation of rebirth which: (a) begins	1
with consciousness and concludes with sensation, (b) has the nature of birth and (c)	1
possesses the distress of old-age and death³05. Moreover, defilement as result includes	1
the remaining elements beginning with consciousness, because they are the result of	1
karma and moral defilement.	1
[17] Furthermore, that same process of dependent origination consists in a sevenfold	1
defilement which refers to seven kinds of causes because they are the causes	1
of: (a) erroneous inversion, (b) projection, (c) leading, (d) possession, (e) sense-	1
experience, (f) attraction and (g) agitation. Of these, the cause of erroneous	1
inversion is ignorance, for one who has succumbed to ignorance erroneously	1
inverts what is impermanent etc. as being of the nature of something permanent etc.	1

"is impermanent etc.""...mi rtag pa la sogs pa la rtag pa'i no bor mthon bas (D210a.1).Y43"	1
due to his confusion about reality. The cause of projection is the formative	0
forces, because they establish in consciousness the 'seed' of rebirth which consists in	0
four of the elements (of dependent origination]. The cause of leading307 is con-	1
sciousness, because it conveys one who has died here in this world to the place of	1
rebirth. The cause of possession is both name / form and the six sense-	1
fields, because that which is led [i.e. consciousness] possesses a (particular] homo-	0
geneous grouping on account of name / form and the six sense-fields. The possession	1
just by name form was mentioned in the above where the womb of creatures born	1
from a womb was intended. Here, the possession by the six sense-fields as well is	1
mentioned having regard for creatures of miraculous birth. Alternatively he wishes to	0
say that, prior to [its possession) by the latter, just the individual nature is possessed by	1
name form; however, since it refers to the possession]308 of either the completed	0
[state], or that which is incomplete there is no contradiction here. The cause of	1
sense-experience is contact and sensation ³09, because the sense-experience of	1
wholesome and unwholesome karma-result is on account of experience, together with	1
its cause. The cause of attraction is craving, grasping and becoming; a	1
naive person whose karma-result has been experienced, craves for various feelings;	1
when craving intensifies he clings to sense-desires etc. on account of his craving for	1
both the union with, and non-separation from, the latter. As the consequence of the	1
grasping for these [sense-desires] his karma belonging to the past, which pertains to	0
the new existence and which is in a state of latent impression, is transformed. This	1
leads to the imparting of the karma-result, in accordance with what has been projected,	1
then after being activated it is becoming'. Moreover, that [karma] is attracted, i.e. is	1
directed 310 towards the actualization of the new existence projected by the formative	1
forces on account of craving, grasping and becoming. Alternatively, craving, grasping	1
and becoming are the cause of attraction since they are directed towards one of the two	1
latent impressions of karma conducive to the passion of sense-desire, on account of	1
craving. The cause of anxiety is birth, old-age and death; thus, here one	1
experiences the pain of birth, old-age and death among the various classes of sentient	1
beings because of the attraction of birth, as well as [experiencing] an endless variety of	1
suffering that consists in sorrow, lamentation, depression and perturbation.	1
[18] In the above, moral defilement and karma311 are shown as general and specific	1
causes [respectively] of rebirth, through the description of threefold defilement. Moral	1
defilement is the general cause [in the germination] of the 'sprout' of rebirth, just as soil	1
is [for a plant]; however, karma is the specific cause, just as the seed is [the specific	1

cause] for its sprout because the differentiation among rebirths is according to the	0
differentiation in that [karma). Alternatively, although there are not three separate	1
segments that comprise the past, present and future in this regard (i.e. dependent orig-	1
ination], he nevertheless demonstrates that it does consist in karma, moral defilement	1
and their result.	1
[19] Through the statement about twofold312 [defilement] he demonstrates that this 313	1
is merely cause and result and that no other agent of action nor agent of sensation is	1
defiled in this regard. Alternatively, the cause refers just to karma and moral defile-	1
ment in this context because it is seen that the presence or absence of rebirth is due to	1
the presence or absence of these two [i.e. karma and moral defilement]; hence, rebirth	1
is indeed the result of them. Therefore, he demonstrates that there is neither cause nor	1
result in this regard, but in every case [i.e. in each of the twelve elements] there is a	1
state possessing the five aggregates.	1
[20] Furthermore, two kinds of dependent origination have been demonstrated	1
through the explanation of the sevenfold causes, namely: that characterized by project-	1
ion and that characterized by actualization. Of these, that characterized by projection	1
has been explained through the seven elements of dependent origination by demon-	1
strating: (a) thet by which it is projected, (b) the way in which it is projected and (c)	1
that which is projected. That which is characterized by actualization [has been	1
explained] through the five [remaining] elements [by demonstrating]: (a) that by which	1
there is the actualization of what has been projected, (b) the way in which it actualizes	1
and (c) the actualization (itself], as well as the distress [implicit] therein. What is the	1
agent of projection? The formative forces which have ignorance for their causal con-	1
dition. How so? After becoming acquainted with erroneous inversion due to delusion	1
about reality 314, [ignorance] formatively influences the wholesome, unwholesome and	1
neutral formative forces. How is it projected by those formative forces? They	1
establish it in the appropriate place315 of rebirth due to the development of the 'seeds' in	1
consciousness. What is projected? All that pertains to the new existence, i.e. name /	1
form, the six sense-fields, contact and sensation, respectively. By what means is there	1
the actualization of that which is projected in this way? As has been said, [it is actual-	1
ized] in stages from what was previously projected through grasping which has for its	1
causal condition that craving which has already arisen in dependence upon the	1
sensation that has arisen in the present lifetime. How is it actualized through this	1
[grasping]? The karma which is in the state of latent impression within consciousness	1
is caused to come into being through that [grasping], for many kinds of latent	1

impressions of karma exist in consciousness because it is fully developed by various	0
kinds of formative forces. That on account of which there is a new existence, because	1
it is encapsulated by a special grasping, is described here as 'becoming'. Just what is	1
this actualization? It is that birth in the future of the name form etc. that has been	1
projected. Now, when that occurs what is distressful? Old-age and death, because one	1
is deprived of cherished youth and vitality316. [Objection]: What if one were to	1

The Summary Meaning of the Imagination of	1
What is Unreal.	1
[To recapitulate], the summary meaning of the imagination of what is	1
unreal is revealed as consisting in nine types of characteristic: (a) the	1
characteristic of existence, (b) the characteristic of non-existence, (c)	1
the individual characteristic, (d) the characteristic of the totality, (e) the	1
characteristic of the expedient for entry into the characteristic of non-	1

[To recapitulate], the summary meaning of the imagination of what is	1
unreal...; the explanation of the meaning in detail is for the purpose of reaching an	1
understanding with ease. Whereas the explanation of the summary meaning is for the	1
purpose of remembering it. Consequently, both meanings are stated here: (a) The	1
"characteristic of existence: ""there is the imagination of what is unreal"" (I.1 a)."	1
"(b) The characteristic of non-existence: ""the duality is not found therein"" (I.1"	1
"b). (c) The individual characteristic: ""consciousness comes into being in the"	1
"appearances of objects, sentient beings, the self and representations"" (1.3 ab). (d) The"	1
"characteristic of the totality: ""the imaginary, the other-dependent and indeed the"	1
"perfected"" (1.5 ab). (e) The characteristic of the expedient for entry into the"	1
"characteristic of non-existence: ""based upon perception, non-perception comes"	1
"into being"" (1.6 ab). (f) The characteristic of the differentiation: ""the imagina-"	1
tion of what is unreal consists in the mind and the mental concomitants that pertain to	1
"the three realms of existence"" (I.8 ab). (g) The characteristic of the synonyms:"	1
"""therein, vision in regard to the object consists in consciousness, but in regard to"	1
"particulars, it consists in the mental concomitants"" (1.8 cd). (h) The actualizing"	1
"characteristic: ""the first is consciousness as causal condition, the second pertains to"	1
"sense-experience"" (1.9 ab). (i) the characteristic of defilement: ""due to conceal-"	1

Y45.15 [1] Having stated the ninefold characteristics of the imagination of what is	1
unreal, he now explains the manner in which emptiness should be	1

by him [i.e. Vasubandhu] as: (a) the imagination of the unreal and emptiness; and (b)	1
purification which is preceded by defilement and the correct determination of real	0
nature (dharmata) which has for its basis an understanding of the dharmas. Hence,	1
immediately following the explanation of the imagination of the unreal, he explains the	1
manner in which emptiness should be understood.	1

How can it be non-existent? Because there is the non-existence of	1
the duality. How can it be not non-existent? Because there is the exist-	1
ence of the non-existence of the duality. And this is the characteristic	1
of emptiness. Therefore, in relation to unreal imagination:	1
1.13 d	0
The characteristic consists neither in	1
difference nor identity.	1
If there were difference, real nature (dharmata) would be something	1
other than a dharma, like the impermanence and painfulness [of some-	1
thing impermanent and painful], which is not tenable. If there were	1
identity, there would not be an objective support of purity, [consisting	1
in direct intuition]331, nor would there be a universal characteristic. In	1
this way, its characteristic has been revealed as being devoid of identity	1
and difference.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y46.17 [1] How should the characteristic be understood? Since the characteristic	1
was listed initially 332, hence it is that which is queried from the very beginning.	1
I.13 ab	1
The non-existence of the duality,	1
which consists in the existence of a	1
non-existent, is the characteristic of	1
emptiness333.	1
Thus should it be understood. There is the non-existence, in the nature of an	1
entity, of the duality of apprehended object and apprehending subject,	1
because its nature is imaginatively constructed either in the imagination of what is	1
unreal, or by the imagination of what is unreal. This existence of that non-exist-	1
ent duality is the characteristic of emptiness. Owing to the rules of prosody in	1
the above verse, the abstract suffix334 [i.e. the tã of śünyatā] is to be regarded as	1
"expressed although omitted. What is meant by ""the existence of a non-existent""? The"	1
nature of a non-existent is existence, otherwise, because its non-existence would not	1
exist as an [empty] existent3³35, there would be the existence of the existent duality.	1

"the nature of an existent. [Objection]: The word ""existence"" is superfluous here"	1
"because this meaning is understood as being implicit in the word ""non-existence"" even"	1
"if the word ""existence"" is omitted, since it is a statement about the denial of existence."	1
"[Response]: It is not superfluous. If it were only stated that ""the non-existence of the"	1
"duality is the characteristic of emptiness"", one would understand 337 the non-existence"	1
of the duality as just an independent reality, like the non-existence of the horns of a	1
hare, and not the fact that it consists in real nature, like the painfulness etc. [of some-	1
thing painful]. Therefore the non-existence of the duality is thus described as empti-	1
ness and the existence of its non-existence in the imagination of what is unreal is also	1
described as emptiness. The fact that [emptiness] has the nature of real nature is	1
demonstrated because it is included as the characteristic of the existence of a non-	1
existent.	1
"[2] Alternatively, since the word ""non-existence"" in the statement ""the non-existence"	1
"of the duality is emptiness"" has only general significance, it cannot be discerned here"	1
which non-existence is intended. Thus in order to demonstrate its absolute non-exist-	1
"ence it is said: ""there is the existence of the non-existence of the duality in the imagina-"	1
"tion of what is unreal"", for antecedent non-existence [i.e. before coming into being] and"	1
subsequent non-existence [i.e. after passing from being] cannot be spoken of other	1
than as self-appropriation ³38. Moreover, reciprocal non-existence, i.e. as having a	1
single basis, is not tenable because [separate] basis is required in both cases. There-	1
fore, because it appropriates the characteristic of the non-existence of an existent, it has	1
been shown that it indeed the absolute non-existence of the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject that is [equivalent to] emptiness.	1
[3] If emptiness has the nature of non-existence, how can it be described as the	1
absolute? Because it is the object of the highest direct intuition, like the impermanence	1
[of what is impermanent], but not because it is an entity. Moreover, this does not have	1
a non-existent own-being, because this own-being of that non-existent, it339:	1

How can it be non-existent? Because there is the non-existence of the	0

non-existence of the duality, 341 for the non-existence of the duality is not	1
[equivalent to the non-existence, by way of own-being, of the non-existent duality. If	1
it were that non-existent, the duality would exist and there would not be the real nature	1
of the imagination of what is unreal; and, by analogy; [there would be no] imperma-	1
nence and painfulness [of what is impermanent and painful]. It is said to be neither	1
existent nor non-existent because it has the nature of the non-existence of a permanent	1
and pleasurable entity which is imputed through erroneous inversion on the part of	1
sentient beings.	1
[4] If the emptiness of the imagination of what is unreal is real nature, 342should this	1
be described as other than that [imagination of what is unreal], or not other? Hence he	1
says: and this 343 is the characteristic of emptiness; i.e. it is the very own-being	1
of non-existence 344. Alternatively, existence itself has the nature of the denial of non-	1
existence. Therefore, in relation to unreal imagination:	1
1.13 d	0
The characteristic consists neither in	1
difference nor identity.	1
If there were difference, real nature (dharmata) would be something	1
other than a dharma which is not tenable. Why is it not tenable? Because if	1
its characteristic were different from a dharma, real nature would in fact be another	1
dharma, like any dharma other than it; however, one dharma cannot be the real nature	1
of another dharma because, in that case, another dharma would have to be sought [to	1
account for real nature] and there would be an infinite regress. Like the imperma-	1
nence and painfulness (of something impermanent and painful]; i.e., just	1
as impermanence is not other than what is impermanent and painfulness [is not other}	1
than what is painful 345, so too is emptiness not other than what is empty. If there	1
were identity, there would not be an objective support of purity, nor	1
would there be a universal characteristic. Since one is purified by it, the path	1
is purity 346. The path would not be an objective support, like the individual char-	1
acteristic of a dharma, because there would be no difference from the individual char-	1
acteristic of that dharma. Therefore, since it would not be different from the individual	1
characteristic, the universal characteristic would not be tenable. Also, since it can be	1
differentiated from something else, just as the essential nature of one dharma [can be	1
differentiated from another], universality is lost. Alternatively, because the individual	1
characteristic would not be different from this [universal characteristic] there would be	1

no difference, like [in the case of the essential nature of an existent thing347.	0
Consequently, there would be no universal as well because the universal characteristic	1
depends upon the fact of differentiation348 [i.e. such as between the universal and the	1
individual characteristic]. Alternatively, an objective support of purity is an objective	1
support for purification; and the individual characteristic of something, if it is taken as	1
[an objective] support, does not bring purity because all sentient beings would already	1
be purified.	1
[5] If [emptiness] cannot be described in terms of difference and identity [in relation to	1
the imagination of what is unreal], why is the doctrine of the Nirgrantha not given	1
credence? Because one who believes in the Nirgrantha doctrine does not make a	1
distinction in regard to the difference or identity of something that truly exists ³49.	1
However, since emptiness is not an existent, there is no fault here.	1
[6] Thus emptiness is: (a) the characteristic of non-existence, (b) the characteristic of	1
the essential nature of non-existence, (c) the characteristic of the absence of the duality	1

A synonym 350 is well known as a different word351 for the one thing. It is described	1
as a synonym since it is expressive of a synonymous meaning. The one and the same	1
emptiness is explained in other Sūtras by these terms. Although these five synonyms	1
as mentioned in the verse are the principal ones, the other synonyms³52 that are not	1
mentioned here are to be learned from the scriptures; for example: the absence of the	1
duality, the realm without conceptual differentiation, real nature, the inexpressible,	1
absence of cessation, the unconditioned and nirvāṇa etc.	1
c. The Meaning of the Synonyms of Emptiness.	1
How should the meaning of the synonyms be understood?	1
I.15 abcd	1
The meaning of the synonyms are,	1
respectively: (a) immutability, (b) the	1
absence of erroneous inversion, (c)	1
the cessation of those [signs], (d) the	0
sphere of the Noble Ones and (e) the	1
cause of the noble qualities.	1
It is thusness in the sense of immutability, considering that it is	1
eternally just thus. It is the limit of what is real in the sense of the	1
freedom from erroneous inversion because there is no foundation for	1
erroneous inversion. It is signless in the sense of the cessation of	1
signs because of the absence of all signs. Because it is the sphere of	1
the direct intuition of the Noble Ones, it is the absolute for it is the	1
domain of the highest direct intuition. Because it is the cause of the	1
noble qualities, it is the dharmadhātu, for the noble qualities arise with	1
"that as their support in this context the meaning of ""dhatu"" is 'cause'"	0
(hetu).	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] How should the meaning of its synonyms be understood ³53? He	1
shows this as follows: these words are not metaphors, rather, they conform with the	1
actual meaning [of emptiness].	1

absence of erroneous inversion, (c)	1
the cessation of those [signs], (d) the	0
sphere of the Noble Ones and (e) the	1
cause of the noble qualities.	1
It is thusness in the sense of immutability. What is meant is: in the sense of	1
unchanging. In order to demonstrate just this, he says: considering that it is eter-	1
nally just thus354. What is meant is: it is unchanging because it is unconditioned	1
always, i.e. at all times 355. It is the limit of what is real in the sense of the	1
freedom from erroneous inversion; the real means: the true and non-erroneously	1
inverted. The limit is the extremity; i.e. beyond this there is nothing to be known.	0
Hence the limit of what is real356 is described as the extremity of what is real. How	1
can thusness be described as the extremity of the knowable?357 Because it is the	1
sphere of direct intuition that is purified 358 from obscuration consisting in the know-	1
"able. The words: ""in the sense of the freedom from erroneous inversion"" are equiva-"	1
lent to: 'in the sense of the freedom from superimposition and negation'. Here now he	1
gives the reason: because there is no foundation for erroneous inversion.	1
Erroneous inversion is [equivalent to] conceptual differentiation; [emptiness] is not a	1
foundation 359 for erroneous inversion because it is not an objective support for	1
conceptual differentiation. It is signless in the sense of the cessation of	1
signs360. Signlessness, in this context, is described as the cessation of signs. In	1
order to demonstrate just this, he says: because of the absence of all signs.	1
Since emptiness is empty of all signs, both conditioned and unconditioned, it is	1
described as signless. It is signless because of the non-existence of all signs; only that	1
which is without signs361 is signless. Because it is the sphere of the direct	1
intuition of the Noble Ones, it is the absolute 362. For, supramundane direct	1
intuition is the highest (parama); the object (artha) of that is the absolute (paramārtha) -	1
in order to demonstrate just this, he says: since it is the domain³63 of the high-	0
est direct intuition. 364 Because it is the cause of the noble qualities, it	1

is the dharmadhātu. In this context it is the noble qualities that are [referred to] by	1
the word dharma, i.e. those beginning with correct view and concluding with correct	1
liberation and direct intuition; since it is the cause of these, it is the source (dhātu). In	1
order to illustrate just this he says: for the noble qualities arise with that as	1
their support. Since this term dhatu also occurs in the sense of a base for both the	1
individual characteristic and the [twenty-four] secondary forms of matter365, he says:	1
"in this context, the meaning of ""dhatu"" is 'cause' (hetu); for example, [a"	1
mine is described as] the source of gold or the source of copper³66. Other synonyms	1
that are also mentioned in other Sūtras should be explained by way of their intrinsic	1
meaning in accordance with this method.	1

and apprehending subject; or else, it was stated that its differentiation should be under-	0
stood immediately following the [section on the] meanings of its synonyms. Hence,	1
immediately after the explanation of the latter, he asks: how should the differen-	1
tiation of emptiness be understood? The imagination of the unreal is	1
[equivalent to] defilement when that is relinquished, it is described as purity; and at	1
the times of defilement and of purification367 there is nothing else that is subject to	1
defilement and to purification apart from emptiness. Therefore, in order to demonstrate	1
that at the times of defilement and of purification it is just emptiness that is subject to	1
defilement and to purification, he says:	1
I.16 a	0
As defiled and pure;	0
Thus is its differentiation.368 Since it is not known when it is defiled and when it	0
is devoid of stain, he asks: in which state is it defiled and in which is it	1

1.16 b	1
it is both accompanied by stain and	0
devoid of stain ³70 etc.	1
[Emptiness] is respectively determined to be accompanied by stain371 and as having its	1
stain relinquished depending upon whether or not there is a turning about of the basis.	1
Emptiness does not manifest for those who do not know, whose mental continuum	1
possesses the stain of defilement of the notional attachment to both the apprehended	0
object and apprehending subject and passion etc., due to the faults of both lack of	1
insight and wrong insight with regard to such [people] it is determined as bei	1
accompanied by stain. However, the emptiness which is unblemished like space mani-	0
fests continually for the Noble Ones whose minds are free from erroneous inversion	1
because of their direct intuition of reality with regard to such [people] it is said to	1
have had its stain relinquished. The fact that emptiness has a relationship372 with	1
defilement and purity in this way should be seen, although its own-being does not	1
possess stain because it is luminous by nature.	1
[2] If, after being stained...373 Since a differentiation in state is not seen without	1
a modification, and since modification is logically connected with production and	1
destruction, he says: how can it not be impermanent since it possesses the	1
quality of change? Because there is no other modification of emptiness apart from	1

Purity is considered as like the	1
purity of elementary water, gold and	1
space.	0
Therefore, it is not impermanent. For example, elementary water, gold and space do	1
not possess stain for their own-being because they do not have such an own-being;	1
both when possessing adventitious stain and also when adventitious stain is removed,	1
while not taking on a different own-being, they remain pure. Similarly, emptiness too	1
is defiled by adventitious stain and is purified as the result of the removal of that,	1
although its own-being is unchanged. For, he who determines the one and the same	1
entity initially as having the characteristic of defilement and subsequently as	0
having purity for its own-being, does not [avoid the conclusion] that a dharma which is	1
modified is destroyed due to a modification in its own-being. However, this is not so	1
when both [i.e. defilement and purity] are adventitious; therefore, this [process] does	1
not 'touch' the real nature of change [i.e. emptiness).	1

Such as the [ten] powers, the [four] intrepidities and the special	1

should be understood in this way. What again is emptiness in this	1
regard?	1
1.20 abcd	1
The non-existence of the personal	1
entity and of the dharmas is [one]	1
emptiness here, and the actual exis-	0
tence of their non-existence in that	1
[enjoyer etc.] is another emptiness.	0
The non-existence of the personal entity and the dharmas is one	1
emptiness and the actual existence of their non-existence in the above-	1
mentioned enjoyer etc. is another emptiness. In order to state the char-	1
acteristic of emptiness he respectively determines emptiness as twofold	1
at the end, [namely], the emptiness of non-existence and the emptiness	1
of the own-being of non-existence for the purpose of avoiding impu-	1
tation in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas and the negation	1
of their emptiness, in due order. The differentiation of emptiness	1
should be understood in this way.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Since all differentiations of emptiness should be described in the section that	1
explains its differentiation376, he says this is another differentiation: the six-	1
teen types of emptiness. It is sixteenfold according to its differentiation in	1
relation to [various] entities, however, there is no differentiation in regard to its own-	1
being which consists in the non-existence of the duality. These sixteen pes are taught	1
in the Prajñāpāramitãs as emptiness, beginning with internal emptiness and concluding	1
376 Ms.(15a.1); prabheda...; disregard Y's fn.3 p.52.Y53	0
with the emptiness of the own-being of non-existence. These should be known in	0
brief as:	1
The emptiness of the foundation for:	0
(a) the enjoyer, (b) enjoyment, (c)	0
the body [which is the locus] of	0
these and (d) the support etc.	1
Emptiness is a universal characteristic because all dharmas have the essential nature of	1
the non-existence of the duality. Since it is not possible to show its multiplicity in any	1
other way, he shows its multiplicity by way of its multiple foundations.	1
1.17 ab	1
[2] From the very beginning, the enjoyer is to be annihilated [through clear under-	1
standing]377 in order to abandon one's affection and notional attachment to it; for this	1
affection and notional attachment are impediments to the attainment of liberation and	1
Buddhahood. Immediately after that, the enjoyment belonging to that [enjoyer] [is to	1
be annihilated]. Immediately after that, the physical body which is the locus of both of	1
these [is to be annihilated]. Then, the inanimate world, i.e. the support for the physical	1
body which is the locus for both [the enjoyer and the enjoyment] is to be annihilated	1
[through clear understanding] in order to destroy the grasping of and affection for [the	1
inanimate world] as belonging to the self because it is of service to the enjoyer. These	1
are the four types of foundation - the emptiness of these is described as the emptiness	1
of the foundation.	1
[3] Of these, the emptiness of the enjoyer refers to the internal sense-	1
fields 378, beginning with 'sight' up until 'mind'. Because there is no agent of enjoy-	1
ment apart from these and because they see the eyes etc. as active in the sense-	1
experience of objects, people have an erroneous view of the 'enjoyer' especially in	1
regard to sight and the other [senses]; therefore the emptiness of the sense-fields of	1
sight etc. is described as the emptiness of the enjoyer.	1
[4] The emptiness of enjoyment [refers to the external [sense-fields] ³79;	1
beginning with 'form' up until the 'non-sensible'. Since they are enjoyed (bhujyante) as	0
entities of the sensory domain, they are [described as] enjoyments (bhojana). Hence	1
the emptiness of the external sense-fields is described as the emptiness of enjoyment.	1
[5] The body belonging to those is the physical body because both the	1
enjoyer and the enjoyment are established as mutually inseparable [entities]380 in	0

the physical body; hence the emptiness of that is described as internal	0
and external emptiness³81.	1
[6] The foundation for the support refers to the inanimate world; because	1
it is perceived as the foundation for the support of sentient beings in every respect³82	1
This is why he says: the emptiness of that is described as universal empti-	1
"ness because of its extensiveness. The word ""foundation"" is connected"	1
individually [with each of the four categories discussed].	1
[7] To that bodhisattva-yogi who is mentally attentive, through proper mental attention	1
accompanied by deliberation in regard to the emptiness of the four types of entity 383	0
that are to be known, a different 'sign-grasping' becomes evident, [namely] - that	1
knowledge of emptiness through which this [entity] consisting in the internal	1
and external sense-fields etc. is seen to be empty384. There is [a twofold] con-	1
ceptual differentiation: (a) the notional attachment to the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject and (b) just this here is an aspect of the absolute according to	1
what is seen through that knowledge of emptiness. For the sake of the annihilation	1
[through clear understanding] of these two modes of conceptual differentiation which	1
have the sign of error pertinent to the spiritual level of the yogi, (a) the emptiness of	1
emptiness and (b) the emptiness of the absolute [are indicated], respectively. These are	1
"indicated, bearing in mind that the words ""knowledge"" and ""aspect"" are [respectively]"	1
omitted 385 [i.e. the full expressions would be śünyatā(jñāna)śūnyatā and	1
paramärtha(ākāra)śünyata. Alternatively, that knowledge is described as emptiness³86	1
because it has emptiness for its object. The emptiness, of the existence of the	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject, of that is the emptiness of empti-	1
ness. Also, the way in which the latter, i.e.] the internal sense-fields etc., are	1
seen through that knowledge of emptiness as the absolute in this context the	1
emptiness of that aspect is the emptiness of the absolute. What is the	1
reason? Because the absolute is empty of the imaginary nature387.	1
[8] The other 'sign-grasping' [referred to above] is harmful to the meditative develop-	1
ment of emptiness; the essential nature of an entity (bhāva) is imputed upon that for	1
the sake of which the bodhisattva aspires388 to [the understanding of] empti-	1
ness. In order to clearly understand this emptiness has been explained, beginning with	1

"tence"". The words 396; ""he does not throw away"", express the same sense as ""he"	1
"does not dismiss"". If this is so, how then can the nirvana-realm that is devoid of"	1
the remnants of existence be proven? It is an established fact that even in the nirvāṇa-	1
realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence, there is no interruption to the Dharma	1
Body belonging to the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, which is an entity free from	0
impurity 397 because of the non-existence of the body which is the karma-result of the	1
impure dharmas. Hence, the emptiness of that is described as the emptiness	1
of non-rejection.	1
And, for the purity of the spiritual	1
lineage (gotra);	1
The emptiness of this is intrinsic emptiness; here now he gives the reason: because	0
the spiritual lineage is intrinsic; how so? he responds: since it derives	1
from own-being 398. That which derives from own-being exists from time	1
immemorial; what is meant is: it is not adventitious. In the same way that some	0
[entities] in beginningless samsara are endowed with consciousness and some are non-	1
conscious, similarly, in this regard some [beings] endowed with the six sense-fields	1
belong to the spiritual lineage of the Buddhas and some belong to the spiritual lineage	1
of the śrävakas etc. Since the spiritual lineage consists in a regular sequence [of	1
rebirths] that is beginningless, it is not accidental like the difference between non-	1
conscious and conscious [entities]. Others believe that since all sentient beings belong	1
"to the spiritual lineage of the tathāgata, the term ""spiritual lineage"" in this context"	1
should be understood accordingly 39⁹9.	1

tence of their non-existence in that	1

The non-existence of the personal entity and the dharmas is one empti-	1
ness and the actual existence of their non-existence in the above-	1
mentioned enjoyer etc. is another emptiness. Of these, the non-existence of	1
the personal entity and the dharmas is [equivalent to the emptiness of non-existence.	1
The actual existence of that non-existence is [equivalent to] the emptiness of own-being	1
of non-existence. 405 For what reason are these two kinds of emptiness respectively	1
determined at the end?406 Hence he responds: in order to state the characteristic	1
of emptiness407. Why is there a re-statement of emptiness? Hence he says: for the	1
purpose of avoiding both imputation in regard to the personal entity and	1
the dharmas and the negation of their emptiness, in due order. In order to	1
avoid imputation in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas, he determines the	1
emptiness of non-existence; and in order to avoid negation in regard to the emptiness	1
of the latter, [he determines] the emptiness of own-being of non-existence. If the	1

emptiness of non-existence were not mentioned one may conclude that the dharmas	0
and the personal entity, whose essential nature is imaginary, do exist. If the emptiness	1
of own-being of non-existence were not mentioned, one may conclude that emptiness	1
is indeed non-existent and as a consequence of the non-existence of the latter, the	1
personal entity and the dharmas would exist like before.	1
[16] In the above, internal emptiness refers to: (a) the non-existence of: (i) the personal	1
entity, i.e. the 'enjoyer' and (ii) sight etc., whose characteristic is imagined, among the	1
internal sense-fields which have the [karma-] result-consciousness [i.e. the store-	1
consciousness] for their own-being and are regarded by naive people as constituting an	1
'agent of enjoyment', and (b) the actual existence of the non-existence408 of the latter.	1
External emptiness refers to: (a) the non-existence of: (i) enjoyment that pertains to the	1
self and (ii) form etc., whose characteristic is imagined, among the external sense-fields	1
which have the appearances of representations of form etc. for their own-being and are	1
regarded by naive people as objects of enjoyment, and (b) the actual existence of the	1
non-existence of the latter. Internal and external emptiness refers to: (a) the non-exis-	1
tence of: (i) a personal entity as 'enjoyer' in that body, i.e. the physical body, (ii) form	1
etc. which is imaginatively constructed by naive folk and (iii) the body itself, and (b)	1
the existence of the non-existence of the latter. Universal emptiness refers to: (a) the	0
non-existence of a world of sentient beings within the inanimate world, (b) the non-	1
existence, by way of essential nature, of such an imaginative construction and (c) the	1
actual existence of the non-existence of the latter. In regard to both the knowledge of	1
emptiness409 and an aspect of the absolute, the emptiness of emptiness and the empti-	1
ness of the absolute refer respectively to the non-existence of: (a) the knowledge of	1
emptiness, on the part of the knowing agent, which has the characteristic of an imagi-	1
native construction and (b) the aspect of the absolute on the part of the personal entity	1
who is the apprehender of the aspect410, and the actual existence of the non-existence	1
of the latter. Now, that for the sake of which the bodhisattva aspires, i.e. [the under-	1
standing of the emptiness of the conditioned411, concluding with the emptiness of all	1
dharmas refers respectively to: (a) the non-existence both of the dharmas which have	1
an imaginary characteristic and of the personal entity, among those elements beginning	1
with the conditioned up until all the Buddha qualities which are the aim of the	1
bodhisattva's accomplishment 12 and (b) the actual existence413 of the non-existence of	1

the latter. For there exists no personal entity, whether it be 'owner' or 'agent' pertinent	0
to the conditioned, nor does a conditioned [entity] exist in the nature imagined by naive	1
folk. These sixteen kinds of emptiness which pertain to the bodhisattvas and which are	1
not common to the śrävakas have been explained in brief in order to counteract all	1
grasping on account of conceptual differentiation, and also, in order to explain all	1
hidden meanings of the Sūtras.	1
[17] And in this respect, the object of emptiness, the own-being of emptiness and the	1
aim of the meditative development of emptiness have been shown by the Venerable	1
One. Of these, the object of emptiness refers to those subjects beginning with the	1
'enjoyer' up until the Buddha qualities; furthermore, the demonstration of the latter is	0
for the sake of showing that emptiness pervades all dharmas. The own-being of	1
emptiness refers to both the own-being of non-existence as well as the own-being of	1
the existence of non-existence414. Moreover, the demonstration of the own-being of	1
emptiness is in order to show the nature of escape415 from all [false] views since it	1
[acts as] counteragent to superimposition and negation. The aim of the meditative	1
development of emptiness begins with the [aspiration for the attainment of the dual	1
virtues (cf. I. 18a) and concludes with the [aspiration for the] attainment of the Buddha	1
qualities (cf. I.19cd). Furthermore, the demonstration of the latter is in order to	1
demonstrate that the culmination of the perfection of the Form and Dharma Body, for	1
oneself and others, is due just to the meditative development of emptiness416. The	1
differentiation emptiness should be understood in this way; i.e. it	1
should be known that [emptiness] is defiled in the stained state and is purified in the	1
stainless state; and it has a sixteenfold differentiation as just described, beginning with	1
internal emptiness.	1

e. The Logical Proof of Emptiness.	1
How is its logical proof to be understood?	1
1.21 abcd	1
If it were not defiled, all incarnate	1
beings would be liberated. If it were	1
not pure, effort would be in vain.	1
If the emptiness of the dharmas were not defiled by adventitious	1
secondary defilement, even when no counteragent has arisen, all	1
sentient beings would be liberated without any effort at all because of	1
the absence of defilement. Now, even when the counteragent has	1
arisen, should [emptiness] not become purified, undertakings for the	1
sake of liberation would be in vain. And so, after considering it in this	1
I.22 ab	0
It is neither defiled nor is it unde-	1
filed. It is neither pure nor is it	1
impure;	1
How can it be neither defiled nor impure? [Because] by way of	0

How can it be neither undefiled nor pure?	1

tiation418, immediately after the explanation of that he asks: How is its logical	1
proof to be understood?419 What is to be proven here? The fact that: (a) it is	1
defiled by adventitious secondary defilement and (b) it has purity of own-being. In the	1

Liberation is [equivalent to the relinquishment of defilement; the relinquishment of	0
such defilement is due to the meditative development of the path. In this respect, if	1
the emptiness of the dharmas were not defiled by adventitious	1
secondary defilement, even when no counteragent has arisen; the word	1
"""even"" implies that like when it has arisen [it would not be defiled] - this being so, all"	1
sentient beings would be liberated without any effort at all421 because of	1
"the absence of defilement. The words: ""without effort""422 are [equivalent to]"	1
'without a counteragent'. However, since there can be no liberation for living beings	1
without the counteragent, in the state of ordinary people the fact of defilement of thus-	1
ness423	1
by adventitious stain must necessarily be admitted the differentiation of	0
emptiness as defiled is proven in this way.	1
[2] Now, in order to prove the differentiation [of emptiness] as purified, he says:	1
1.21 cd	1
If it were not pure, effort would be	1
in vain424,	1
It is [the effort] of incarnate beings that is referred to. Now, even when the	0
"counteragent has arisen; the word ""even"" implies that like when it has not arisen"	1
[it would not become pure]; should [emptiness] not425 become purified; this	1
being so, the undertakings for the sake of liberation would be in vain	1
because even through the meditative development of the counteragent, separation from	0
such stain would not occur and also because liberation is not possible for one who	1
possesses stain. However, [the undertakings] for the sake of liberation are not consid-	1
ered to be in vain; therefore, due to the practice of the counteragent, the purity of	1
emptiness, through the separation from adventitious secondary defilement, must	1
necessarily be admitted. The differentiation of the purity of emptiness is proven in this	1
way. In this context, defilement is due to the appropriation of the dharmas that consti-	1
tute defilement and purity is due to the appropriation of the dharmas that constitute	1
purity. However, neither defilement nor purity is considered to be manifestly present	1
for emptiness426 because real nature is dependent upon the dharmas. This is why he	1
"says: ""all incarnate beings would be liberated"". The term ""incarnate beings"" in the"	1

above refers to just the 'ground' (upādāna; rgyu) of these [i.e. defilement and purity].	0
Otherwise, if defilement or purity were manifestly present for emptiness, then what	1
connection would it have with incarnate beings, on account of which both the purity	1
and defilement of the incarnate beings is described as being due to the purity of empti-	1
ness and the defilement of emptiness, respectively? And when emptiness is defiled in	1
the state of ordinary people and is pure in the state of the Noble Ones this too427 has	1
been proven:	1
It is neither defiled nor is it unde-	1
filed; it is neither pure nor is it	1
impure. 42	1
How can it be neither defiled nor impure?429 It is definitely pure because this	1
is made clear through the use of the double negative. Here he quotes scriptural tra-	1
dition: [Because] by way of intrinsic nature:	1
1.22 C	1
There is the luminosity of mind;430	1
"Here it is indeed the real nature of mind that is referred to by the word ""mind"" for the"	1
[phenomenal] mind is characterized by stain.431 How can it be neither undefiled	1
nor pure? On the contrary, the use of the double negative makes it clear that it is	1
definitely defiled.	1
1.22 d	1
1.22 ab	1
Because of the adventitious nature of	1
defilement. 432	1
He shows that it is defiled but not intrinsically so433. Scriptural tradition is also quoted	1
"here: ""It is defiled by adventitious secondary defilement""."	1
[4] When it has been differentiated as twofold, i.e. as defiled and pure, why then is a	1
fourfold differentiation mentioned? Some say that it is in order to demonstrate 34 the	1
distinction between the mundane path and the supramundane path, for, the mundane	1
path is defiled by the stain pertinent to its own level but not by that which belongs to a	1
lower [level] because [the former] is the counteragent to the latter. The supramundane	1
path is impure [in one sense] because it is differentiated as weak, middling etc., how-	1
ever, it is pure due to the absence of impurity; but not so in the case of emptiness.	1
Again, after describing [emptiness] as undefiled, others describe it as not impure in	1
order to distinguish it from the [sense-faculties] of sight etc., because sight etc. are not	1

The Summary Meaning of Emptiness.	1
Therein, the summary meaning of emptiness should be known both	1
in terms of characteristic and establishment. Of these, in terms of	1
characteristic includes both the characteristic of non-existence and the	1
characteristic of existence. Furthermore, the characteristic of existence	1
includes both the characteristic as devoid of existence and non-exis-	1
tence and the characteristic as devoid of identity and difference. Again,	1
its establishment should be known in terms of the establishment of its	1
synonyms etc. In this regard, through these four modes of teaching: (a)	1
the individual characteristic of emptiness, (b) the characteristic of	1
karma [pertinent to its realization], (c) the characteristic of both its	1
defilement and purification and (d) the characteristic of reasoning	1
[pertinent to its proof] are made known these lead to the appeasement	1
of: (a) conceptual differentiation, (b) fear, (c) indolence and (d) doubt,	1
[respectively].	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y61.22 [1] The summary meaning of emptiness 437 should be understood both in	1
terms of characteristic and establishment. Of these, in terms of charac-	1
teristic includes both the characteristic of non-existence and the	1
characteristic of existence. It [should be known] in terms of the characteristic of	1
"non-existence because of the statement: ""the non-existence of the duality"" (I.13 a). It"	1
[should be known] in terms of the characteristic of existence because of the statement:	1
"""which consists in the existence of a non-existent"" (I.13 b). Furthermore, the"	1

"it not exist"" (1.13 c); ...refers to both the characteristic as devoid of exis-"	1

"and difference, because of the statement: ""...this is the characteristic of emptiness."	1
"Therefore, in relation to the imagination of what is unreal:"" (I.13 c comm.) ""The char-"	1
"acteristic consists neither in difference nor identity."" (I.13 d). This is the summary"	1
meaning in terms of characteristic.	1

[2] How should its summary meaning be understood in terms of establishment?	1
Again, its establishment should be known in terms of the establishment	1
of its synonyms etc.439 What is meant is: its synonyms, their meaning, its differ-	1
entiation and logical proof. Through these four modes of teaching, beginning	1
with the characteristic, (a) its individual characteristic, (b) the characteristic	1
of karma [pertinent to its realization], (c) the characteristic of both its	1
defilement and purification and (d) the characteristic of reasoning	1
[pertinent to its proof] are made known as the counteragents to the four types	1
of secondary defilement440. Of these, the individual characteristic [acts] as the counter-	1
agent to conceptual differentiation; the latter consists in the perception [of things]	1
as existent, non-existent, both [existent and non-existent] and different or identical.	1
The characteristic of karma [acts] as the counteragent to fear for those who, after	1
learning of the characteristic of emptiness, do not have firm conviction, for example,	1
(a) the karma that pertains to [the realization of] thusness that is free from error, (b) the	0
karma that pertains to the absence of erroneous inversion, (c) the karma that pertains to	1
the relinquishment of all signs, (d) the karma that exists in the sphere of all supra-	1
mundane direct intuition and (e) in regard to the objective support, the karma that	1
pertains to the causal ground of the noble qualities. Thus, the characteristic of the	1
differentiation is for the removal of indolence on the part of lazy people who, just by	1
learning of the own-being of emptiness and the karma [pertinent to its realization]	1
'seize' this as sufficient. The characteristic of reasoning is for the removal of doubt on	0
the part of skeptics who believe that [emptiness] is subject to defilement and	1
purification.	1

The ObscurationsN28.3	1
With reference to the obscurations, he says:	1
II.1 abc	1
[Sthiramati]	1
1. The Five Obscurations Beginning with the	1
Pervading.	0
Of these, (a) the pervading refers to obscuration consisting in both	1
moral defilement and the knowable and is pertinent to those who belong	1
to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it forms the totality.	1
(b) The limited refers to obscuration consisting in moral defilement and	1
is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka	1
etc. (c) The excessive refers to [obscuration] that pertains only to those	1
who course in passion etc. (d) The equal refers to [obscuration] that	1
pertains to those who course in equal shares. (e) The obscuration com-	1
prising the acceptance and rejection of samsāra is pertinent to those	1
who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it is an	1
obscuration to the nirvana [wherein the bodhisattva is] not permanently	1
fixed. Thus these obscurations are elucidated respectively as being	1
pertinent to both, i.e., as pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual	1
lineage of the bodhisattva as well as those who belong to the spiritual	1
lineage of the śrävaka etc.	1
(a) The pervading, (b) the limited,	1
(c) the excessive, (d) the equal and	1
(e) acceptance and rejection are	1
elucidated as the obscurations that	1
pertain to the two.	1
[1]2 Immediately after the explanation of the characteristic is an appropriate place for	1
the explanation of obscuration and since [the latter] was mentioned immediately	1
following the former, [Vasubandhu] says: with reference to the obscurations,	1
[Maitreya] says:	1
II.1 abc	1
(a) The pervading, (b) the limited,	1
(c) the excessive, (d) the equal and	1
Read: sakalyät omitting kam. Although the Tibetan (mtha' dag la sgrib pa'i phyir Dóa.4)	0
would substantiate a reading of sakalyavaraṇāt, sgrib pa here is probably an elaboration inserted	1
by the Tibetan translator as is clearly the case in several of the following sentences.	1
The first few folios are missing from the Ms. of Ch.II hence the translation of this section is	1
based entirely on the Tib. Fn.15 below indicates the point where the Ms. begins.Y65	1
(e) acceptance and rejection are	1
elucidated as the obscurations that	1
pertain to the two.	1
The obscurations that pertain to the two refer to obscurations pertinent to those who	1
belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva and those who belong to the spiritual	1
Lineage of the śrävaka etc. This verse has been composed in order to demonstrate that	0
the differentiation among the obscurations is in accordance with the difference in	1
benefit that is obscured. Of these, the pervading refers to obscuration con-	1
sisting in both moral defilement and the knowable and is pertinent to	1
those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva. It is the	1
pervading (vyāpi) since it pervades or permeates (vyāpnoti). Because it is an	0
obscuration in regard to the totality of benefit; the totality of benefit is both benefit	1
for oneself and benefit for others. Alternatively, it is described as the pervading since	1
it pervades the obscuration that pertains to the bodhisattva according to the designation	1
of the two as obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable. Since	1
moral defilement is itself an obscuring, it is [described as] an obscuration. Herein,	1
"secondary defilement is also referred to by the word ""moral defilement"" because it is"	1
"exactly similar in its nature as moral defilement. Otherwise, the words: ""the character-"	1
"istic of moral defilement is ninefold"" [verse II.1 d], would not include envy and avarice"	1
since these two are both secondary defilements. It is an obscuration that consists in the	1
knowable because it is an obscuration in regard to the knowable. Since that which is	1
knowable is concealed (prāvṛta) on account of this, it is not the sphere of knowledge.	1
Alternatively, it is an obscuring of direct intuition in regard to the knowable because it	1
creates an obstruction to the arising of direct intuition in regard to the knowable. There	1
"is the omission of the word ""of"" between the words ""obscuration"" and ""knowable"" [in"	1
the compound jñeyāvaraṇa] as in the [tatpuruşa] compound 'a pot of oil' (tailakuṇḍa).	1
Furthermore, it consists in undefiled nescience. Those who belong to the spiritual	1
lineage of the bodhisattva endeavour in every way to produce the accumulations of	1
merit and direct intuition for the sake of the attainment of Buddhahood since it is the	1
culminating attainment3 in regard to benefit for both oneself and others. Because both	1
[those consisting in moral defilement and the knowable] are obscurations to the latter	1
[i.e. Buddhahood] they are determined as obscurations pertinent to those who belong	1
to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva. [Objection]: In this respect, given that the	1
"pervading has the whole for its domain and the expression ""the totality"" means ""in"	0
"every respect"", how does the totality intimate pervading? [Response]: It is described as"	1
obscuration that pervades because it forms the totality by way of its explanation as a	1
"cause. Alternatively, the statement: ""because it forms the totality"" is made in order to"	1
"explain the word ""pervading"" as having the meaning of totality."	1
D: phul du byun ba thob pas (220a.5), although P: ...thob pa.Y66	1
[2] The limited refers to obscuration consisting in moral defilement and	1
is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka	1
etc. It is designated as an obscuration since it is an obscuration in regard to just one's	1
"own benefit and is described as ""limited"" because it does not pervade. Why does"	1
undefiled nescience not pertain to śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas? Because if it is	1
determined that only obscuration consisting in moral defilement is pertinent to them,	1
then in that case, [undefiled nescience] is not an obscuration pertinent to them because	1
śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas [are said to] attain enlightenment even though it exists.	1
[Objection]: Is nescience on the part of the śrävaka etc. not an obscuration to the	1
arising of knowledge in regard to the sphere of the truth of suffering etc.? Therefore,	1
the two obscurations would be pertinent to them as well. Consequently, perhaps it	1
should not be said that only obscuration consisting in moral defilement is pertinent to	1
śrävakas etc.? [Response]: This is not so, since ignorance is determined just as obscur-	1
ation that consists in moral defilement because: (a) it is defiled, (b) it is adverse to	1
knowledge and (c) it is the root of samsāra. However it is not [determined as] obscura-	1
tion that consists in the knowable, like uncertainty. For example, uncertainty in regard	1
to the sphere of the truth of suffering etc. is not [uncertainty] in regard to other spheres	1
described as doubt and moral defilement, for it is only uncertainty in regard to another	1
sphere and not defilement nor doubt. Similarly, nescience in regard to just the sphere	1
of the truth of suffering etc. is ignorance and moral defilement but not in regard to	1
other spheres, for in regard to other spheres it is only nescience and not ignorance nor	1
moral defilement. Therefore, since [nescience] described as the obscuration that	1
consists in the knowable because it is an obscuration to the emergence of only the	1
direct intuition of what is knowable, moral defilement, karma and rebirth are not	1
produced as is ignorance. [Objection]: If this be so, [obscuration that consists in the	1
knowable] cannot be determined as the obscuration pertinent to bodhisattvas.	1
[Response]: This is not so [since] obscuration that consists in the knowable is the	1
obscuration pertinent to bodhisattvas because they are characterized by the accumu-	1
lations of learning. It is said:	1
Without applying himself to the five kinds	0
of learning, in no way can a Supremely	1
Noble One arrive at omniscience; thus, he	1
applies himself to these, either to restrain or	1
assist others or, for his own knowledge.4	1
[3] The excessive; even a small aspect of passion etc. that manifests continually and	0
to an excessive degree in those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva	1
4 This verse is from MSA XI.60:	0
vidyasthane pańcavidhe yogam akrtvä sarvajñatvam naiti kathamcit param āryaḥ/	1
ity anyeşâm nigrahaṇānugrahanaya svājňärtham vă tatra karoty eva sa yogam //Y68	1
and those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc. ...refers to	0
[obscuration] pertinent to those who course in passion etc. Those who	1
course in passion and the like refers to those for whom any passion manifests continu-	1
ously and to an excessive degree even in regard to a miserable things.	1
[4] The equal; i.e., obscuration pertinent to both those belonging to the spiritual	1
lineage of the bodhisattva and those belonging to the spiritual lineage of the śrāvaka	1
etc. It is equal because the two modes are absent; refers to [obscuration] pertin-	0
ent to those who course in equal shares. They who course in equal shares	1
refers to those for whom moral defilement manifests in conformity with the object, but	0
not continuously.	1
[5] The obscuration comprising the acceptance and rejection of	1
samsāra...; the bodhisattva accepts samsāra on account of his compassion yet, on	1
account of his wisdom, after observing the evil of samsara as it is in reality, he rejects7	1
it. Consequently, although free from moral defilement [himself], having regard for	1
sentient beings, he takes rebirth in the nirväpa [wherein the bodhisattva is]	1
not permanently fixed, because he is not permanently fixed in samsara or nirvāṇa.	1
The obscuration to this consists in the acceptance of samsāra as being overcome by	1
moral defilement or the complete rejection of samsăra without compassion, after	1
observing its evil as it is in reality. Others believe that nescience is described as an	1
obscuration herein because it is an obstruction to both compassion and wisdom.	1
"Alternatively, as has been stated in the Maharatnakūta: ""His mental disposition is"	1
"directed towards nirvāṇa but his application is directed towards samsara""8. This is the"	1
unfixed nirvana of the bodhisattva. In this regard, in order to turn his back on nirvāṇa	1
he accepts samsāra with his mental disposition and application, just like a sentient	1
being who has no spiritual lineage. Similarly, in order to turn his back on samsāra, he	1
completely rejects samsāra with both his mental disposition and application directed	1
towards entering nirvāṇa, just like those who belong to the spiritual lineage of śrävakas	1
etc. Thus, both the acceptance of samsāra and its rejection are obscurations in regard	1
to the unfixed nirvana of the bodhisattva because they both constitute a falling to one	1
extreme away from samsāra as well as nirvāṇa. At the time that they become tathā-	1
gatas, bodhisattvas do not remain in samsāra because they have relinquished both the	1
obscurations that consist in moral defilement and the knowable. And because the	1
Dharma Body continues without interruption in the nirvana devoid of the remnants of	1
Read: hine 'pi vastuni; cf. AS-Bhasya #142.	0
This refers to the normal state of defilement devoid of both the excessively strong and weaker	1
degrees; cf. ibid.: samabhagacaritaḥ praktisthaḥ samkleśaḥ autkatyamandyavivarjitasamävasthe	0
kleša ity arthaḥ.	1
Tib. should probably read gton bas in place of ston pas (cf.D221a.4).	1

found in KP #16 (p.35).N28.13	1
existence, they do not remain in nirvana like śrävakas and the like. Thus they are not	0
fixed permanently in samsāra or nirvāņa.	1
[6] These five obscurations have been enumerated here because they cause obstruction	1
in regard to: (a) the path of the bodhisattva and the śrävaka etc., (b) their application,	1
(c) the result and (d) the unfixed nirvana [of the bodhisattva). Thus these	1
[obscurations are elucidated] respectively, i.e. as is appropriate. Therein, the	1
first and the last [i.e. the 'pervading' and 'acceptance and rejection'] are obscurations	1
pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva.	1
But that which follows the first [i.e. the limited'] is an obscuration pertinent to	1
those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc. The other	1
two [i.e. the excessive' and the 'equal'] are obscurations pertinent to both. In the	1
above, obscuration that consists in the knowable has been described as obscuration	1
that pertains to the bodhisattvas, moreover, it is known as undefiled nescience.	1

false view of individuality, the foun-	1

Cessation, the path, the [three]	0

austerity.	1
The fetters are obscurations⁹. The fetter of pride is an obscuration	1
in the clear comprehension of the false view of individuality because	1
the non-relinquishment of the latter is on account of the manifestation	1
of intermittent and continuous self-conceit at the time of direct reali-	1
zation. The fetter of ignorance [is an obscuration] in the clear compre-	1
hension of the foundation of the false view of individuality because the	1
lack of clear comprehension in regard to the aggregates that have been	1
appropriated is on account of that. The fetter that consists in false view	1
[is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the truth of cessation	1
because the fear of the latter is on account of the false views of	1
individuality and the grasping of extremes and is also due to negation	1
by wrong view. The fetter of clinging [to false views etc.] is [an	1
obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the truth of the path because	1
one clings to the highest purity with the wrong motive. The fetter of	1
doubt is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the three jewels	1
due to the lack of true belief in the virtues of the latter. The fetter of	1
envy is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of gain and honour	1
because one does not perceive the faults of the latter. The fetter of	1
avarice is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of austerity	1
because one covets the necessities of life.	1

obstruct, hence he says:	1
II.1 d	0
The characteristic of moral defile-	1
ment is ninefold.	1
It is the obscurations that are referred to. The characteristic of moral defilement is	1
[equivalent to] the essential nature of moral defilement. What are these ninefold	1
[fetters]? Hence he says: [they are]:	1
samyojanany avaraṇam but Tib. has simply sgrib pa yin; (D6b.2).Y70	0
11.2 a	1
The fetters etc.	1
They are fetters inasmuch as they fetter [people] to various sufferings. The various	1
sufferings which belong to the group of sense-desire, form and formlessness, refer to	1
the painful nature of suffering, the painful nature of change and the painful nature of	1
the formative forces as is appropriate to the three realms of existence. They begin with	0
the fetter of attachment and conclude with the fetter of avarice. Therein, repugnance	1
refers to aversion. Envy refers to intolerance in regard to another's success 10. Avarice	1
refers to miserliness concerning the necessities of lifell; these three pertain to sense-	1
desire. The fetter of attachment consists in the passion that pertains to the three realms	1
of existence. Similarly, the fetters of pride, ignorance, false view, clinging [to false	1
views etc.] and doubt all pertain to the three realms of existence. The fetter of false	1
view comprises the false view of individuality, the grasping of extremes and wrong	1
view. The fetter of clinging [to false views etc.) comprises the clinging to false view	1
and to morality and vows. Doubt is disbelief in regard to the [noble] truths and the	1
[three] jewels. Moreover, those other secondary defilements, such as anger, are defi-	1
nitely obscurations that consist in moral defilement because they are the	1
natural outcome of moral defilement and they are defiled. Envy and avarice are	1
"referred to as fetters because of their predominance, for it is said in a Sutra: ""O"	1
"Kausika, the gods and mankind possess the fetters of envy and avarice"" 12."	1
[2] The obscurations that comprise these [fetters] are relevant to what?	1
Hence he says:	1
II.2 bc	1
They are relevant to anxiety,	1
equanimity and the insight into	1
reality;	1
Anxiety is included among the synonyms for despondency, hence it is said: the fetter	0
of attachment is an obscuration relevant to anxiety. Since the attachment to	1
the physical body, vitality, enjoyment and family etc. as well as to the meditative	1
absorptions and formless [attainments] is on account of this, one does not become	0
anxious of the three realms, although oppressed by the sufferings of samsära. The	1
fetter of repugnance is [an obscuration] relevant to equaniraity. How so?	1
Hence he says: because, on account of this, one is unable to be even-	1
minded, i.e. free from formative influence, in regard to the foundation of	1
repugnance, i.e., the cause of repugnance, especially something disagreeable	1
etc.; it is disagreeable insofar as it is the cause of depression. It is logical that it is not	1

the Kośa-vyakhya (W491.5-6).Y71	1
possible to be even-minded in regard to the foundation of attachment because of the	0
absence of what is disagreeable. However, since the foundation of repugnance	1
consists in repugnance especially in regard to something disagreeable, one is unable to	1
be even-minded. Hence in order to demonstrate that the latter [i.e. the fetter of repug-	1
"nance] is a greater evil than [the fetter of] attachment, he says: ""especially"". When one"	1
who is engaged in meditative concentration gains equanimity of the formative forces,	1
his mind consequently becomes even. However, if the fetter of repugnance reaches an	1
excessive degree in such a person, then on account of the latter, he does not attain	1
equanimity in regard to the cause of repugnance; and when that occurs the self is	1
necessarily supported as an objective support; thus, on account of the fetter of attach-	1
ment he does not find solitude. Conversely, although isolated on account of the fetter	1
of repugnance he does not attain meditative concentration.	1
[3] Furthermore, the remaining seven [fetters] are obscurations relevant to	1
the insight into reality, i.e. they are obscurations to true insight. He asks: How	1
do they occur? Since this is not known he says: They occur respectively:	1
II.2 d	1
[In the clear comprehension] of: the	1
false view of individuality, the foun-	1
dation of the latter etc.	1
The fetter of pride is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the	1
false view of individuality. Pride herein refers to that arrogance of mind which	1
has the false view of individuality for its basis 13 and this is sevenfold ¹4 according to its	1
differentiation as pride, excessive pride etc.15 The clear comprehension of the false	1
view of individuality refers to the insight into the false view of individuality through	1
the discrimination of: (a) a self, (b) what pertains to a self, (c) the apprehending subject	1
and (d) the apprehended object, as well as through the discrimination ¹6 of an own-	1
being on the part of the dharmas as imagined by naive people. The fetter¹7 of pride is	1
an obscuration to that [insight] because it obstructs its arising. As to how and when	1
this occurs, he says: because the non-relinquishment of the latter is on	1
account of the manifestation of intermittent and continuous self-conceit	1
at the time of direct realization18. The time of direct realization of the truth is	1
"equivalent to the condition that is conducive to penetration. In the above ""intermittent"""	1
"refers to that which is interrupted by the counteragent; ""continuous"" refers to that"	1
14 Read: saptavidham in place of navavidham; Tib, mam pa bdun (D222b.5). This sevenfold	0
division is substantiated by the T-Bhaşya (L29.4-17) where seven kinds of pride are defined.	1

which is not interrupted by the counteragent. And this should be understood in regard	0
to strong and weak counteragents [respectively]. For as long as intermittent and con-	1
tinuous self-conceit19 manifests, there is no relinquishment of the false view of indi-	1
viduality since the arising of self-conceit is only on account of the false view of	1
individuality.	1
[4] The fetter of ignorance [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehen-	1
sion of the foundation of the false view of individuality. It is the fact that	1
it is an obscuration that is referred to. The foundation of the false view of individuality	1
refers to the five aggregates that have been appropriated because it arises from the	1
objective support that consists therein; as is stated in a Sutra:	1
Certain śramaṇas or brahmanas perceive the self as the self and are notionally	1
attached to it; it is just on the basis of these five aggregates that have been	1
appropriated that they perceive and are notionally attached to the latter.20	1
Just what is this clear comprehension? It is the perception of the emptiness of the self	1
and what pertains to the self21 and the emptiness of the own-being of the dharmas	1
which is imagined by naive people in regard to the aggregates as well as their percep-	1
tion as impermanent, painful, empty, without self or as originating etc. this is clear	1
comprehension of those [aggregates]. Here now he gives the reason: because the	0
lack of clear comprehension in regard to the aggregates that have been	1
appropriated is on account of that. Ignorance is an obscuration in the clear	1
comprehension of the aggregates because, on account of ignorance, there is the absence	1
of clear comprehension of these [as impermanent etc.] in regard to the aggregates	1
which are obscured by aspects of permanence etc.	1
[5] The fetter that consists in false view [is an obscuration] in the clear	1
"comprehension of the truth of cessation; the word ""obscuration"" remains in"	1
force. The fetter of false view comprises three false views: The false views of: (a)	1
individuality, (b) grasping of extremes and (c) wrong [view]. In the above, the false	1
view of individuality refers to the notion that there is a self or what pertains to a self	1
among the five aggregates that have been appropriated. The false view that consists in	1
the grasping of extremes concerns that same entity that has been construed as a self and	1
refers to the notion that it is eternal or that it perishes22. Wrong view refers to that	1
notion on account of which one negates an entity, whether it be cause, result, deed or	1
an actual existent, or else wrongly construes it. The clear comprehension of the truth	1

of cessation refers to [its comprehension] in accordance with the aspects such as the	0
tranquil. Just how can [false view] be an obscuration to that [clear comprehension]?	1
Hence he says: because the fear of the latter [i.e. cessation] is on account	1
of the false views of both individuality and the grasping of extremes	1
and is also due to negation23 by wrong view. Therein, on account of the false	1
"views of individuality and the grasping of extremes one fears cessation, thinking: ""I"	1
"will not exist in that [state]"", also, on account of wrong view one negates it, thinking"	1
there is indeed no cessation. In this respect, on account of the false views of individu-	1
ality and the grasping of extremes, one does not clearly comprehend [cessation] as	1
tranquil, sublime and as escape24; yet on account of wrong view one does not compre-	1
hend it as cessation. In this way the fetter that consists in false view becomes an	1
obscuration in the clear comprehension of cessation.	1
[6] The fetter of clinging [to false view etc.] is [an obscuration] in the	1
clear comprehension of the truth of the path25. Therein, the fetter of clinging	1
refers to both the clinging to false view and the clinging to morality and vows. Cling-	1
ing to false view therein refers to that notion in regard to false view and the five aggre-	1
gates that have been appropriated and which are the basis of false view26, as being pre-	1
eminent27 and so on. Clinging to morality and vows refers to that notion on the part of	1
one who perceives either morality, vows, both of these or the five aggregates that have	1
been appropriated and which are the basis of that [notion], as being [equivalent to]	1
purity, liberation or definitive liberation. Furthermore, the clear comprehension of the	1
path is in accordance with aspects, such as definitive liberation. Just how can the fetter	1
of clinging be an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the path? Hence he says:	1
because one clings to the [highest] purity with the wrong motive28; i.e.	0
because one clings to purity as either: (a) just morality and vows, (b) an abode of	1
pleasure pertinent to sense-desire, (c) ascetic practices or (d) the knowledge of enu-	1
merations etc. By clinging to a [false] view on account of just which one believes in	1
purity, one clings to that same [view] as being pre-eminent. Thus, on account of the	1
fetter of clinging [to false view etc.] one abandons the path and clings to purity with the	1
wrong motive29	1

[7] The fetter of doubt [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of	1
"the three jewels; the word ""obscuration"" remains in force. As to how this can be"	1
so, he says: because of the lack of true belief in their virtues. The fetter of	1
doubt is perplexity in regard to the truths and the [three] jewels. There is clear com-	1
prehension in regard to the jewel of the Buddha as being the final basis for the	1
excellence and absence of all virtues and faults [respectively 30. There is clear compre-	1
hension in regard to the jewel of the Dharma: (a) as being the conveyance across the	1
ocean of samsära, (b) as having the nature of the absolute separation from all suffer-	1
ing31 together with its causes and (c) as providing the understanding of the latter.	1
There is clear comprehension in regard to the jewel of the Sangha as: (a) the locus for	1
the results of monkhood³2, (b) engagement in the latter and (c) the 'field' worthy of	1
supreme veneration. By acquiring perfect faith through the perception of truth and the	1
relinquishment of doubt³ one truly believes in the virtues of the three jewels and since	1
there remains no doubt that is not relinquished, the fetter of doubt is described 34 as an	1
obscuration in the clear comprehension of the three jewels.	1
[8] The fetter of envy is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of	1
gain and honour. Here now he gives the reason: because one does not	0
perceive the faults of the latter. For the fetter of envy, which has aversion for a	1
component, refers to the dissatisfaction of mind in regard to another's success and is	0
pertinent to one intent upon gain and honour³5. Clear comprehension in regard to gain	1
and honour is [equivalent to] the awareness that these are the basis of all misfortune³6	1
However, on account of envy one does not clearly comprehend gain and honour ³7 as	1
being adverse to all virtue nor as the root of various misfortunes. Hence the fetter of	1
envy is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of gain and honour.	1
[9] The fetter of avarice [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension	1
of austerity. As to how this can be so, he says: because one covets the	1

necessities of life. Avarice which has passion for a component refers to miserli-	0
ness of mind in regard to goods and chattels on the part of one who is intent upon ³8 the	1
necessities of life. Austerity consists in the separation from from the necessities of life.	1
Its clear comprehension is [equivalent to] the understanding that it is the foundation or	1
basis of all virtue. However, one does not clearly comprehend it as the basis of all	1
virtue because one is intent upon the necessities of life on account of avarice.	1
Consequently, it is said that avarice is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of	1
austerity.39	1
[10] In [summary of the above, the fetters of attachment and repugnance are obscura-	1
tions in the endeavour to reach an understanding of reality [but the remainder are	1
not]40. The remainder are obscurations to the understanding of reality for one who has	1
[already] applied himself [in such an endeavour]. For this very reason the sequential	1
order of these [fetters] is given; for example, one who desires liberation41 should, from	1
the very beginning, necessarily cause his mind to shrink from samsāra. Following	1
from that, he should have equanimity towards everything. After that, the false view of	1
individuality should be clearly comprehended because it is the root of all misfortune.	1
Then, the foundation of the latter should be clearly comprehended as consisting in	1
suffering and its arising. Then, the cessation of the latter should be understood. Then,	1
the path of attainment should be understood. Then, one acquires perfect faith in regard	1
to the three jeweis due to the awareness of their virtues and the vision of the truth.	1
And since it is only on account of the force of the vision of the truth that one becomes	1
a seer of the faults and virtues [respectively] of gain and honour as well as austerity,	1
thus the sequential order of these obscurations should be understood in conformity	1
with the respective cause of the dharmas to be obscured 42. [Objection]: Since it is	1
possible that obscuration can pertain to all [the fetters] at all times43, the explanation of	1
obscuration as restricted to each individual foundation is not tenable. [Response]: A	1
restriction 44 to each individual foundation is not employed here; on the contrary, this	1
explanation is chiefly in terms of close contiguity.	1

Which obscurations are to be known as being pertinent to each of	1
these [qualities] beginning with virtue?	1
II.10 ab	1
The obscurations that pertain to	1
these [qualities] are to be known in	1
groups of three.	1
The three obscurations to the wholesome are: (a) lack of application,	1
(b) application in regard to unworthy objects and (c) superficial appli-	1
cation. The three obscurations to enlightenment are: (a) the non-arising	1
of the wholesome, (b) lack of mental attention and (c) incomplete accu-	1
mulations. Complete acceptance refers to the generation of the resolve	1
for enlightenment. The three [obscurations] to the latter are: (a) depri-	1
vation of spiritual lineage, (b) deprivation of good friends and (c)	1
mental exhaustion. Intelligence refers to the bodhisattva state. The	1
three obscurations to the recognition of the latter are: (a) deprivation of	1
spiritual practice, (b) living with stupid people and (c) living with	1
pernicious people. Therein, stupid people are [equivalent to] foolish	1
people; pernicious people are those who bear il will. The three	1
[obscurations] to absence of error are: (a) the disquiet of erroneous	1
inversions, (b) whatever remains from the three obscurations such as	1
moral defilement and (c) the non-maturation of the wisdom that brings	1
liberation to fruition. Absence of obscuration is [equivalent to the	1
relinquishment of obscuration. The three [obscurations] to the latter	1
are: (a) innate disquiet, (b) laziness and (c) carelessness. The three	1
[obscurations] to transformation, on account of which one's mind is	0
transformed into other modes and not into supreme and perfect	1
enlightenment, are: (a) attachment to existence, (b) attachment to	1
enjoyments and (c) faintheartedness. The three [obscurations] to lack	1
of fear are: (a) a low opinion of people, (b) a lack of firm conviction in	1
regard to the Dharma and (c) deliberation in accord with the letter as	1
FoothY75.14	0
regards its meaning. The three [obscurations] to lack of avarice are: (a)	0
a lack of enthusiasm for the true Dharma, (b) enthusiasm for gain and	1
honour and for veneration and (c) lack of compassion for sentient	1
beings. The three [obscurations] to mastery, on account of which one	1
fails to obtain supremacy, are: (a) loss of what has been learnt due to	1
the arising of karma conducive to the loss of the Dharma, (b) learning	1
little and (c) lack of the necessary preparation for meditative	0
concentration.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Are the latter [i.e the obscurations that consist in the nine fetters] the only obscu-	1

all the roots of the wholesome (dharmas]; enlightenment is the result of it. In the	1
above, virtue has been listed in general terms but it is not understood by way of differ-	1

[2] Some believe that since the obscurations to virtue and enlightenment are explained	1
as independent, as are [the obscurations to] complete acceptance etc., they are discerned	1
in this context just as independent [entities] but not as things that can be listed and	1
explained. [This is not so]; the obscuration to arising is determined in relation to virtue	1
and it is common to such things as the resolve for enlightenment because of the	0
necessity for the production of that virtue. The obscuration to complete acceptance etc.	1
and the obscuration to the basis are obscurations to complete acceptance etc. and are	1
different [from the obscuration to virtue]49. Also, since enlightenment is unshakable	1
and is to be attained, both the obscuration to its maintenance and the obscuration to its	1
attainment are respectively determined. Therefore, independence does not result here.	1
[3] And their sequential order in brief is as follows: Enlightenment is to be attained	1
after perfecting the root of the wholesome in its entirety. In detail [it is as follows]:	1
From the very beginning the resolve towards enlightenment should be generated	1
because it is the foundation for the accomplishment of benefit for both oneself and	1
others. Then comes spiritual practice in regard to [the six perfections], beginning with	1
generosity, which conforms with 50 the generation of the resolve, and, on account of	0
which, one is recognized51 as a bodhisattva. After that, as the result of continual	1
practice throughout immeasurable aeons 52 and in order to purify one's mental disposi-	1
tion through the collection of the accumulations of merit and direct intuition, the path of	1
vision, which has the nature of the absence of error, should be generated as the counter-	0
agent to error in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas. Then the path of	1
meditative development which is characterized by the separation from obscuration	0
should be followed to its culminating point in order to bring about the possession of a	0
special purity53. Then, all the mundane and supramundane roots of the wholesome	1
should, as they are collected, be transformed into enlightenment through application	0
that transcends that of the śrävaka etc. Then, one who has arrived in this condition has	1
no fear54 in regard to the profound and sublime explanations of the Buddha and the	1
bodhisattvas because he is mentally disposed towards universal enlightenment 55.	1

Then, one who is endowed with much learning56 and understanding teaches the sub-	1
lime Dharma for the purpose of bringing sentient beings to full maturation. After that,	1
it is said that one attains mastery, i.e. Buddhahood, when those to be trained are	1
brought to full maturation in order to liberate them.	1
[4] Here the obscurations are stated as thirty, but only ten qualities to be obscured [are	1
stated] beginning with virtue, hence he asks: which obscurations are to be	1
known as being pertinent to each of these [qualities] beginning with	1
virtue?	0
II.10 ab	1
The obscurations that pertain to	1
these [qualities] are to be known in	1
groups of three57;	0
In the above, the three obscurations [to the wholesome] are: (a) lack of	0
application, i.e. lack of enterprise. What is the obscuration in this context? One	1
does not apply oneself on account of any moral defilement, whether it be carelessness	1
or laziness. Or else, one does not apply oneself to that particular condition, whether it	1
be undefined or defiled, that possesses the 'seed' of moral defilement. It is described as	1
the lack of application since one does not apply oneself continually or respectfully	1
because [one's application] is insignificant but not because of an absence of application,	1
because if the latter were the case there would be no possibility of obscuration. (b)	1
Application in regard to unworthy objects58. Scriptural works, which are the	1
'doorway' (dvāra) to the origination of enlightenment and the roots of the wholesome	1
which bring about enlightenment, are worthy objects (āyatana). Something other than	0
the latter is an unworthy object (anāyatana). Application in regard to the latter is appli-	1
cation in regard to an unworthy object59, i.e. in regard to objects other [than worthy	1
objects]. What is the obscuration here? The nescience or moral defilement that	1
consists in wrong view on account of which one applies oneself to an unworthy object	1
as well as that application is the obscuration. (c) Superficial application. An	1
expedient60 is something fundamental (yon); application that is contrarywise to what-	1
ever expedient one possesses is superficial (ayoniśaḥ) application. It is mentioned in	1
this very scriptural instruction, namely:	1
For one who courses in passion, the meditative development of friendliness	0
is not an expedient for the relinquishment of passion, [likewise] the meditative	1

development of the impure62 is [not an expedient for the relinquishment of	0
repugnance] for one who courses in repugnance.	1
Here too, superficial mental attention or application which has that for its cause is an	1
obscuration.	1
[5] The three [obscurations] to enlightenment...; enlightenment consists in an	1
understanding that is in accord with its object. ...are: (a) the non-arising of the	1
wholesome, which has already been discussed. How can its non-arising be an	1
obscuration? When the wholesome does not exist there can be no enlightenment,	1
hence the non-arising of the wholesome is an obscuration to enlightenment. Alterna-	1
tively, that moral defilement or particular state which is an obscuration to the arising of	1
the wholesome 63 is also [an obscuration] to enlightenment, for that which is an obscu-	1
ration to the accumulations [of merit and direct intuition] is certainly also [an obscura-	1
tion] to its result. (b) Lack of mental attention, is [equivalent to] the lack of the	1
meditative development of [wholesome elements] that have already arisen; what is	1
meant is: they are not augmented64, Even though wholesome [elements] are produced	1
in a particular state, one is not mentally attentive time and again65 on account of moral	1
defilement such as laziness. This is the obscuration here. (c) Incomplete accu-	1
mulations. Enlightenment is attained through a certain amount of accumulations.	0
While the accumulations of merit and direct intuition are incomplete one abides in a	1
morally defiled condition like before, or eise, one has scanty accumulations. However,	1
another believes that although no distinction is made here, non-arising is intended just	1
as [an obscuration]66 to those elements conducive to penetration and not to others.	0
Also, there can be a lack of mental attention to those [elements conducive to penetra-	1
tion] that have arisen, although one is being mentally attentive; the non-accumulation of	1
what has been accumulated [on account of that] is described as an obscuration.	1
[6] Complete acceptance refers to the generation of the resolve for	1
enlightenment. Complete acceptance consists in the generation of the resolve for	1
enlightenment since the accumulations of merit and direct intuition, in their entirety, and	1
the result of these, i.e. Buddhahood, are to be completely accepted and possessed on	1
account of the fact that they should cause all sentient beings67 to be established in the	1
most excellent nirvāṇa realm devoid of the remnants of existence by means of this	1

[resolve for enlightenment]. Furthermore, this consists in the mental disposition to	1
perform acts of welfare for oneself and others, i.e., it is volition accompanied by will-	1
power. The three [obscurations] to the latter are68: (a) deprivation of	1
spiritual lineage; i.e. not having a spiritual lineage or belonging to the spiritual	0
lineage of the śrävaka etc. (b) Deprivation of good friends; i.e., although one	1
belongs to a spiritual lineage, one does not meet with those who inspire the generation	1
of the resolve for enlightenment69; or else, on account of these [people], one turns	1
away from enlightenment, or is not strengthened by the wholesome dharmas. Even	1
when one meets with good friends, there is (c) mental exhaustion70 - on account	1
of the sufferings of samsara the anxious minds of those who have wrong insight	1
aspire for parinirvāṇa as soon as possible. What are the obscurations here? (a) A	0
defect in causes [i.e. gotra], (b) a defect in conditions [i.e. kalyāṇamitra], (c) lack of	1
compassion for sentient beings71 or (d) laziness, since one who lacks compassion for	1
sentient beings is either exhausted or is lazy.	1
[7] Intelligence72 refers to the bodhisattva state, for they are suited to the	1
careful consideration, in every respect, of all that is to be known, because, in compari-	0
son to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc.73, they naturally	0
have keen faculties. And it is just the bodhisattva who possesses intelligence because	1
of his firm conviction in the profound and sublime Dharma; others do not. The	1
bodhisattva state consists in spiritual practice that is not erroneously inverted for the	1
benefit of others74. (a) Deprivation of spiritual practice75; i.e. one does not	1
engage in the practice of the [six] perfections etc., for, one who is situated in'	1
spiritual practice76 is known as a bodhisattva. (b) Stupid people are [equivalent	1
to] foolish people77; what is meant is: people who do not investigate [phenomena]	1
because, stupid people do not know that a particular person is a bodhisattva even	1
though he is occupied with spiritual practice 78, (c) Pernicious people are those	1
who bear ill will; i.e. those who bear enmity towards bodhisattvas. These people	1

fail to see the real virtues of a bodhisattva because they seek79 his point of vulnera-	0
bility. Having concealed the real virtues [of the bodhisattva] they promulgate non-	1
existent faults after superimposing the latter upon the former because they see non-	1
existent faults or have harmful thoughts on account of enmity. What is the obscuration	1
here? (a) That which is adverse to the [six] perfections such as generosity, (b)	1

[8] The three [obscurations] to absence of error...; error is on account of	1
superimposition and negation80; its counteragent is the absence of error and is	1
[equivalent to] the path of vision; ...are: (a) the disquiet of erroneous inver-	1
sions. Some believe that this refers to the maturation of the latent impressions of	0
notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject. Others	1
believe it refers to the maturation of the 'seeds' lodged in the store-consciousness of: (a)	1
all propensities that are to be abandoned by means of [the path of] vision, or (b) unde-	1
filed nescience which is an impediment to 82 the facility for an understanding 83 of the	1
all-pervading dharmadhātu. Others believe that erroneous inversion refers to the	1
conceptual notion of the self etc. in regard to the absence of self etc. (b) Whatever	1
remains from the three obscurations such as moral defilement84. Therein,	1
obscuration that consists in moral defilement is the moral defilement such as passion	1
which manifests intensely and for a long time; it is an obscuration to the absence of	1
error because there is no opportunity for the application of the counteragent to it.	1
Obscuration that consists in karma is the karma that brings an immediate result etc. and	1
which leads necessarily 85 to unfortunate states of existence. Obscuration that consists	1
in the karma-result is the unfortunate state of existence etc. and one who is born therein	1
does not have the good fortune of the arising of the noble Dharma. Moreover, what-	1
ever is left as a remainder from these [three], i.e. moral defilement, karma and rebirth,	0
are obscurations but they are definitely not the entire [obscurations]86. (c) The non-	1
maturation of the wisdom which brings liberation to fruition87; this refers	1
to the fact that the wisdom which brings about liberation is ineffective. Some believe	1

that this is because of the failure to attain the condition conducive to penetration. How-	0
ever, others say that there are two [types] of wisdom in this regard which bring	1
liberation to fruition: (a) absence of conceptual differentiation and (b) the application of	1
the latter³8. The non-maturation of both of these, which respectively consists in an	1
incapacity concerning the understanding of reality and an incapacity concerning the	1
state that causes the latter89, is due to the fact that the accumulations are incomplete.	1
What are the obscurations here? (a) The maturation of the latent impressions of moral	1
defilement that are to be abandoned by the path of] vision90, (b) whatever remains	1
from the obscurations such as moral defilement, (c) nescience which is an impediment	1
to the maturation of wisdom and (d) the non-completion of the accumulations.	1
[9] Absence of obscuration is [equivalent to the relinquishment of	1
obscuration. It is the relinquishment of obscuration since obscuration is relin-	1
quished on account of it. The absence of obscuration consists in the path of meditative	1
development because this is the counteragent to obscuration. The three	1
[obscurations] to the latter are: (a) innate disquiet. This refers to the	1
propensity for moral defilement that is to be abandoned by meditative development.	1
Alternatively, this refers to the maturation of the 'seeds' that are lodged 91 in the store-	1
consciousness, of: (a) the innate (elements] such as the false view of self and (b) unde-	1
filed nescience 92 which is an impediment to the penetration of the highest meaning of	1
the dharmadhātu etc93. (b) Laziness is [equivalent to] slothfulness; this refers to the	1
lethargy of mind that has delusion for a component 94. (c) Carelessness consists in	1
both an excessive attachment to sense-objects and an inattentiveness in regard to the	1
wholesome. Some believe that carelessness here refers to the savouring 95 of meditative	0
concentration. Due to disquiet and laziness in this respect, the path is not cultivated	0

and due to carelessness the mind is not protected from the unwholesome. What are the	0
obscurations here? These very three.	0
[10] The three [obscurations] to transformation 96 on account of which	1
one's mind is transformed into other modes; [and is not transformed into	1
supreme and perfect enlightenment]97. Transformation 98 therein refers to [the trans-	1
formation] of the roots of the wholesome which have already arisen and is restricted to	1
[the transformation] by mind into Buddhahood alone. There are three obscurations to	1
the latter. Which are these three? Those, on account of which, mind is transformed	1
into modes99 other than Buddhahood, i.e. into samsāra or the enlightenment of the	1
śrāvakas etc., ...and not into supreme and perfect enlightenment. And these	1
are: (a) attachment to existence, (b) attachment to enjoyments and (c)	1
"faintheartedness. ""Existence"" refers to the five aggregates that have been appro-"	1
priated. Since they are enjoyed (bhujyante), the sense-objects of form etc. are	1
"""enjoyments"" (bhoga). ""Attachment"" is the strong desire for the latter two."	1
"""Faintheartedness"" refers to a mind that lacks sublimity; i.e. one has a low opinion of"	1
"oneself and thinks: ""how can someone like mel00 obtain Buddhahood?"" In regard to"	1
this, on account of the attachment to existence and the attachment to enjoyments, one's	1
mind is transformed into a propitious state of existence; however, on account of faint-	1
heartedness, the mind is transformed into the śrävaka vehicle etc. What are the obscu-	1
rations in this regard? They are: the craving for existence and enjoyments, laziness and	0
lack of compassion.	1
[11] The three [obscurations] to lack of fear. What is this lack of fear? It is a	1
fearless state that consists in a firm conviction101 in regard to emptiness and the	1
profound and sublime Dharma of the Buddha and the bodhisattvas. (a) A low	1
opinion of people; i.e. erroneous understandings and statements about people who	1
proclaim the way of the universal vehicle, or disbelief in the virtues of morality, medi-	1
tative concentration and wisdom etc. (b) lack of firm conviction in the	1
Dharma; i.e. disbelief concerning the words of the Buddha as expounding a profound	1
and sublime way and as having meaning that is not erroneously inverted. (c)	1
Deliberation in accord with the letter as regards its meaning 102; i.e. one	1
understands only the verbatim meaning of 'non-arisen', 'without cessation' and 'peaceful	1
from the beginning' etc., but the meaning that is intended in reality is not understood.	1

Therefore, there is no firm conviction in regard to the meaning of 'non-arisen' etc.	1
What are the obscurations here? (a) Doubt and (b) nescience which is adverse to both	1
wisdom and meditative concentration and is also adverse to a conclusive investi-	1
gation¹03 of the meaning that is intended.	1
[12] The three [obscurations] to lack of avarice... It is on account of the lack	1
of avarice that one teaches the Dharma, either for the continued existence of the true	1
Dharma, or in order to assist others. are: (a) lack of enthusiasm for the true	1
Dharma; i.e. not holding it dear. It is on account of this that the true Dharma's long-	1
lasting existence is not ensured because it is not conveyed to another's mental	1
continuum. (b) Enthusiasm for gain and honour and for veneration; i.e.	1
holding them dear. One worries that another may be equal or even superior to oneself	1
concerning enthusiasm for the true Dharma, and consequently, one does not teach the	1
Dharma because of fear that gain etc. will be hindered. [Alternatively], although one	1
does not cling to gain and honour, there is: (c) a lack of compassion for	1
sentient beings; i.e. one does not teach the Dharma] 104 due to an absence of com-	1
passion for sentient beings because one who lacks compassion is not affected by the	1
sufferings of sentient beings. What are the obscurations here? (a) Lack of enthusiasm,	1
(b) attachment to gain and honour and (c) lack of compassion.	1
[13] The three [obscurations] to mastery. Since mastery consists in the	1
attainment of all kinds of masteries of the mind, mastery is [equivalent to] Buddha-	1
hood105. But since the three obscurations to the latter are not known, he says: on	0
account of which one fails to obtain106 supremacy. He states that the obscu-	1
rations to mastery are those on account of which supremacy is not obtained, because	1
supremacy is dependent upon the mastery of mind. Furthermore, supremacy refers to	1
excellence in regard to direct intuition, relinquishment and power. Alternatively, by the	1
"statement: ""...those on account of which supremacy is not obtained"", [supremacy] is"	1
demonstrated as a synonym for mastery 107. What is meant is: Buddhahood 108 is not	1
attained. (a) The loss of what has been learnt. [This is equivalent to the total	1
separation from hearing the true Dharma in the same way that¹09 the loss of one's	1

relatives is [equivalent to the total separation from one's relatives. Furthermore, the	0
loss of what has been learnt is due to the arising of karmal10 conducive to the	1
loss of the truell1 Dharma; i.e. because they either abide in the attachment to their	1
own views or they have recourse to people who are not good friends, the Sūtras of the	1
"universal vehicle are rejected by those who lack remorse saying: ""these words are"	0
spoken by Māra and are the cause of unfortunate states of existence; these words are	1
"not spoken by the Buddha"", and they deter other people from these [Sūtras]. They"	1
efface the writings, burn and submerge them in water and so, in various ways, there is	1
the arising of karmal 12 conducive to the loss of the true Dharma on account of the	0
maturation of the 'seed' of an individual nature113 that is deprived of hearing the true	1
Dharma. [Alternatively], when there is no loss of what has been learnt, (b) learning	1
little is referred to as an obscuration since the accumulations of direct intuition are	0
incomplete and one who has little learning is unable to analyse the dharmas. And	1
[alternatively], even if one has much learning, (c) lack of the necessary prepa-	1
ration for meditative concentration114 is referred to as an obscuration. The lack	1
of the necessary preparation for meditative concentration is due to: (a) the absence of	1
any of [the qualities] beginning with will-power, or (b) the non-completion of medita-	1
tive development¹15 because of the absence of any of the eight formative forces that	1
facilitate relinquishment. Alternatively, the lack of necessary preparation refers to the	1
non-perfection of the Buddha's meditative concentrations such as the Vajra-like	1
[concentration]116. What are obscurations here? They are: (a) karma conducive to the	1
loss of the Dharma, (b) learning little, (c) weakness in wisdom and (d) the secondary	1
defilements that are adverse to meditative concentration such as spiritual indifference	1
and restlessness.	1
Furthermore, these obscurations in regard to virtue etc. should be	1
known according to the influence of each [respective] category, in	1

"These same daśakāraṇāni are listed in AS (P28.12) where karanam is defined as the ""own-being"	1
"of the cause"" (hetusvabhava).N32"	1
relation to which there are ten [instrumental] causes. The ten causes	0
are: (a) The cause for origination; for example, the eyes etc. [are the	1
cause] for eye-consciousness, (b) The cause for continued existence;	1
for example, the four types of food [are the cause for the continued	1
existence] of sentient beings. (c) The cause for support refers to that	1
which is the foundation of something; for example, the inanimate world	1
[is the cause for the support] of the world of sentient beings. (d) The	1
cause for manifestation; for example, sight [is the cause for the mani-	1
festation] of form. (e) The cause for modification; for example, fire	1
etc. [is the cause for the modification] of cooked food etc.	1
(f) The	1
cause for disjunction; for example, the scythe [is the cause for the dis-	1
junction] of that which is to be severed. (g) The cause for transfor-	1
mation; for example, a gold-smith etc. [is the cause for the tran for-	1
mation] of gold etc. when it is transformed into things such as	1
bracelets. (h) The cause for a belief; for example, smoke etc. [is the	1
cause for the belief that there is] fire etc. (i) The cause for making	1
[others] believe; for example, the logical reason is the cause for	1
making (others) believe] in a premise. (j) The cause for attainment; for	1
example, the path etc. [is the cause for the attainment] of nirvăpa etc.	1
Thus the obscuration to origination is to be regarded [as an obscu-	1
ration] to virtue because of the necessity for the origination of the	1
latter. The obscuration to continued existence is [an obscuration] to	1
enlightenment because of the unshakability of the latter. The obscu-	1
ration to support is [an obscuration] to complete acceptance because the	1
latter is the foundation of the resolve for enlightenment. The obscu-	1
ration to manifestation is [an obscuration] to the possession of intelli-	1
gence because of the necessity for the promulgation of the latter. The	1
obscuration to modification is [an obscuration] to the absence of error	1
because the latter changes into the reverse of error. The obscuration to	1
disjunction is [an obscuration] to the absence of obscuration because	1
the latter is [equivalent to] separation from obscuration. The obscu-	1
ration to transformation is [an obscuration] to development because the	1
latter is characterized by the transformation of mind into enlightenment.	1
The obscuration to belief is [an obscuration] to lack of fear because fear	1
is due to disbelief. The obscuration to making [others] believe is [an	1
obscuration] to lack of avarice because others are made to believe on	1
account of lack of avarice in regard to the Dharma. The obscuration to	1
attainment is [an obscuration] to mastery because the latter is charac-	1
terized by the attainment of supremacy.N33	1
In regard to origination, continued	1
existence, support, manifestation,	1
modification, disjunction, transfor-	1
mation, belief, making [others]	1
believe and attainment, the causes	1
are tenfold.	1
The examples of these begin with the	1
eyes, food, the ground, light and	0
fire;	1
The remainder begin with the scythe,	0
a craftsman, smoke, the logical cause	0
and the path.	1
118 Now, from the very beginning, on account of the desire to attain	1
enlightenment, the root of the wholesome should be generated. Then,	1
by engendering the force of the root of the wholesome, enlightenment	1
should be attained. Moreover, the resolve towards enlightenment is the	1
support for the origination of the root of the wholesome. The	1
bodhisattva is the [physical] basis of that resolve towards enlighten-	1
ment. Moreover, in order to relinquish119 erroneous inversion, the	1
absence of erroneous inversion is to be generated by the bodhisattva	1
who has secured the engendering of the force of the root of the whole-	1
some and who has generated the resolve towards enlightenment. Then,	0
all obscuration should be relinquished on the path of meditative develop-	1
ment on account of the absence of erroneous inversion¹20 on the path of	1
vision and all the roots of the wholesome should be transformed into	0
supreme and perfect enlightenment owing to the relinquishment of	1
obscuration. Then, by engendering the forces of transformation, there	1
should be no fear in regard to the profound and sublime Dharma teach-	1
ings. Thus, these Dharmas should be revealed to others in full detail by	1
one whose mind is devoid of fear and who sees the virtues of the	1
Dharmas. Following that, the bodhisattva who has secured the engen-	1
dering of the forces of the various virtues in this way soon arrives at	1
supreme and perfect enlightenment, having acquired mastery over all	0
Nagao suggests that the following paragraph of the Bhaşya (N32.11 to 33.2) could well be a	0
later interpolation peculiar to the Bhaşya because it receives no comment by Sthiramati. Cf.	1

dharmas. This is the sequential order of [the development of the	0
categories] beginning with virtue.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Furthermore, these obscurations beginning with lack of application in	1
regard to virtue etc., i.e. in regard to the tenfold categories concluding with	1
supremacy, [should be known according to the influence of each respect-	0
ive category], in relation to which there are ten [instrumental] causes¹21,	1
i.e. in relation to each category 122, beginning with origination and concluding with	1
attainment, there are ten causes, beginning with application123 and concluding with the	1
necessary preparation for meditative concentration, because they are contrary to those	1
obscurations. And although they are individually differentiated here, this explanation	1
does not differentiate [i.e. it designates them all as causes] because no distinction is	1
made concerning causality in regard to origination and the other [nine]. According	1
to the influence of each [respective] category; what is meant is: according to	1
the predominance of the category, such as origination. For, when there is an obstruc-	1
tion to the cause of the origination etc. of these [categories] such as virtue, it is	1
described as an obscuration to origination etc. For example, something, such as a wall	1
which obscures light is described as an obscuration to eye-consciousness which is the	1
effect of that [light]. In this way, thirty [instrumental] causes are explained 124	1
as the	1
reverse of the thirty obscurations that pertain to these ten dharmas [i.e. virtue etc.].	1
[2] In this respect, (a) the three causes for the origination of virtue are: applica-	1
tion, application in regard to worthy objects and proper application. Here now he	1
provides an example: for example, the eyes etc. For the eyes etc. are just causes	1
for the origination of consciousness, they do not cause continued existence etc.125	1
Therein, lack of application etc. is an immediate obstruction to application etc.126, and	1
indirectly, is an impediment to the origination of virtue too, on account of their mutual	1
relationship, thus the obscuration to origination is an obscuration to	1
virtue, hence he says: because of the necessity for the origination of the	1
latter. He shows that this is just an obscuration to origination because there is no	1
possibility of continued existence in regard to virtue [if it has not originated].	1
[3] (b) The cause for continued existence is in relation to enlightenment.	1
The turning about of the basis is [equivalent to] enlightenment which has thusness,	1

Tib. omits ādi; cf. D229b.6.Y85	1
devoid of stain, for its basis 127. Here he gives the reason: because of its unshaka-	0
bility. It is unshakable because it remains for the duration of the world; it cannot	1
become otherwise nor can it cease. However, the enlightenment of the śrävaka etc.	1
ceases after having accomplished its aim in his own mental continuum. The	1
bodhisattvas who with their superior mental disposition which consists in the	1
provision of welfare and happiness for all sentient beings are engaged in accumu-	1
lations, vow to remain [in the world] up until such time as there is the enlightenment	1
characterized by the turning about of the basis for [all] sentient beings ¹28; but not for	0
the sake of mere non-rebirth, like the śrävakas etc. 129 Moreover, since there can be no	1
continued existence without origination130, origination is also [applicable] here. There-	1
fore, just the cause for the continued existence of enlightenment is mentioned, not the	1
cause for origination. And since, there is no other cause for continued existence apart	1
from this, consequently, only the latter is mentioned. Alternatively, enlightenment is	1
[equivalent to] pure thusness and thusness does not originate because it has purity for	1
its own-being. On the contrary, only continued existence is positively mentioned by	1
way of these causes because of the absence of adventitious stain; origination is not	1
[mentioned]. Furthermore, the causes for the continued existence of enlightenment¹31	1
are: (a) the production of the roots 132 of the wholesome, (b) mental attention and (c)	1
accumulations that are complete. And while such things as the non-origination of	0
virtue are hindrances herein to the arising of the wholesome etc.; since they impair the	0
continued existence 133 of enlightenment, they are described as obscurations to its	1
continued existence. (b) The cause for continued existence¹34; here he gives an	1
example: for example, the four types of food [are the cause for the con-	1
tinued existence] of sentient beings, for no new sentient beings are brought	1
into existence by means of the [four] foods such as morsel food135, whereas those who	1
have already come into existence are certainly maintained 136.	1

example: whatever is the foundation of something is indeed its support137,	1
considering that it is supported by this. For example, the inanimate world is	1
[the cause for the support] of the world of sentient beings138. The causes	1
for this [support] are: (a) the spiritual lineage, (b) being endowed with good friends	1
and (c) the absence of mental exhaustion. The deprivation of a spiritual lineage etc. is	1
also mentioned herein as an obscuration to support because it is at odds with the cause	1
for support, hence he says: the obscuration to support is [an obscuration] to	1
complete acceptance because the latter is the foundation of the resolve	1
for enlightenment.	1
[5] The cause for manifestation is in relation to the possession of intelli-	1
gence; because of the necessity for its promulgation by the bodhisattva. Moreover,	1
this refers to: (a) success in spiritual practice, (b) living with suitable people and (c)	1
living with people who are not intent upon harm 39. Since they are impediments to the	1
cause for the manifestation of intelligence, the deprivation of spiritual practice and the	0
like herein are described as obscurations to manifestation. Hence he says: the obscu-	1
ration to manifestation is [an obscuration] to the possession of intelli-	1
gence because of the necessity for the promulgation of the latter. Here	1
now is an example: for example, sight is [the cause for the manifestation]	1
of form 140; for sight141 is the cause for the manifestation of form alone, it is not the	1
cause for origination and the like.	1
[6] The cause for modification is in relation to the absence of error.	1
Because it has the nature of the reverse of the errors of imputation and	1
negation, the absence of error, which is [equivalent to the path of vision, is described	1
as a modification of error¹42. For example, ash etc. [is a modification] of wood etc.	1
The three causes of this are: (a) the eradication of disquiet that consists in erroneous	1
inversion, (b) the absence of the three obscurations such as moral defilement and (c)	1
the maturation of the wisdom which brings liberation to fruition. For example, fire	1
etc. [is the cause for the modification] of cooked food etc. For eatables	1
such as boiled rice are different from uncooked rice etc., but belong to their series. The	1
cause of the latter is fire etc.	1

confused: Mul pa med ni mthon ba'i lam mo // khrul pa med pa'i 'gyur ba źes bya ba ste	1
(D230b.5).Y87	1
[7] The cause for disjunction is in relation to the absence of obscu-	1
ration. The obscuration that remains 143 from obscuration that is to be relinquished by	1
means of the path of vision is relinquished on account of this, thus the absence of	1
obscuration refers to the path of meditative development. The three causes for the latter	1
are: (a) the eradication of innate disquiet, (b) vigour¹44 and (c) the absence of careless-	1
ness. Moreover, these are causes for disjunction because they [act as] counteragents to	1
the cause for non-disjunction. Hence he says: the obscuration to disjunction is	1
[an obscuration] to the absence of obscuration; and this is an obscuration to	1
just the counteragent for the cause for disjunction. Here now he gives the reason:	1
because the latter consists in the separation from obscuration.	1
Since one	1
is separated [from obscuration] on account of this, it is described as disjunction.	1
[8] The cause for transformation is in relation to development ¹45, because	1
the latter is characterized by application in regard to the roots of the wholesome, i.e. in	1
regard to universal enlightenment. Moreover, this consists in a turning aside from	1
existence and enjoyments and the absence of faintheartedness. Consequently, the	1
obscuration to transformation should be regarded as an impediment to the cause for	1
transformation. For what reason? Because the latter, i.e. development, is char-	1
acterized by the transformation of mind146 into universal enlightenment.	1
[9] The cause for belief is in relation to lack of fear. This consists in: (a)	1
the holding of people in esteem, (b) the firm conviction in the Dharma and (c) the	1
understanding of the meaning that is intended. Since belief is on account of these	1
qualities, the obscuration to belief is [an obscuration] to lack of fear¹47,	1
since [the latter] is an impediment to the cause for belief. Here now is the reason148:	1
because fear is due to disbelief because it is on account of disbelief that one has	1
fear of the Dharma.	1
[10] The cause for making [others] believe is in relation to lack of	1
avarice. Moreover, this consists in: (a) enthusiasm for the true Dharma, (b) indiffer-	1
ence towards gain and honour and veneration and (c) compassion for sentient beings.	1
And since it is at odds with the cause for making (others] believe, the obscuration	1
to making (others] believe is established as [an obscuration]149 to lack of	1
avarice. Here now he provides the reason: because others are made to	1
believe! 150	1
on account of lack of avarice in regard to the Dharma. Avarice	0

is created towards the Dharma due to lack of enthusiasm etc. for the true Dharma.	0
Moreover, one does not teach the Dharma to others because of avarice for the Dharma.	1
Hence the obscuration to making [others] believe is described as [an obscuration]151 to	1
lack of avarice.	0
[11] The three causes for attainment are152: (a) the absence of karma conducive to	1
the loss of the Dharma, (b) much learning and (c) the necessary preparation for medita-	1
tive concentration. Loss of what is learnt etc. is established as [an obscuration] to	1
mastery because it is at odds with these [causes]. Here now is the reason: because	1
the latter, i.e. mastery, is characterized by the attainment of supremacy.	1
[12] However, others say that the causes for virtue etc. have the following sequential	1
order. A mental continuum that is supported 153 by the wholesome dharmas is	1
conducive to the attainment of enlightenment; consequently, virtue is mentioned at the	1
beginning. Immediately after that, enlightenment is mentioned. Since [the bodhisattva)	1
has the ability to accomplish both of these owing to his resolve for enlightenment and	1
since his resolve for enlightenment is the support for all the wholesome dharmas until	1
[he attains] enlightenment, the resolve for enlightenment is then mentioned. When he	1
has generated the resolve for enlightenment he applies himself to the six perfections as	1
well as to the avoidance of stupid or pernicious people. In this way his status as a	1
bodhisattva becomes publicly manifest. Hence his possession of intelligence is	1
mentioned immediately after complete acceptance. And while applying himself in this	1
way [the bodhisattva] relinquishes erroneous inversion and produces direct intuition.	1
that is not erroneously inverted. Hence the absence of error is mentioned immediately	0
following the possession of intelligence. Moreover, this consists in the path of vision	1
because obscuration is relinquished through the practice thereon. Hence, immediately	1
after this, the absence of obscuration is mentioned which consists in the relinquishment	1
of obscuration. Since the mind of one who is devoid of obscuration is transformed	1
just into Buddhahood and not into any other [mode of being] because he is not attached	1
to existence and enjoyments, consequently, development is then mentioned. And thus,	1
elation arises towards the extremely profound Dharmas of the Buddha on the part of [a	1
bodhisattva] who has attained such a state of being and since he is devoid of fear, the	1
lack of fear is then mentioned. In this way, since one who has direct perception of the	1
Dharma 154	1
resorts only to those expedients through which he perceives correct	1
discipline for sentient beings, how can there be any avarice on his part? Therefore,	1
immediately after lack of fear, lack of avarice is mentioned. Thus the bodhisattva	1
Tib. inserts avarana which is omitted from the Ms. (cf. D231b.1).	1

[13] Since this chapter is the section concerning obscuration156, the causes for the	1
origination of virtue etc. are not expressed in aphorisms 157 [in Maitreya's kārikās), like	1
the obscurations are. However, a summary of the [causes for the origination of virtue	1

(a) Lack of skill in regard to the foundation is an obscuration to the	1
applications of mindfulness. (b) Laziness is (an obscuration] to the	1
complete relinquishments. (c) The two deficiencies in meditative con-	0
centration are [obscurations] to the bases of psychic power, namely, (i)	1
[a deficiency] in completeness165 due to defectiveness in either will	1
power, vigour, mind or examination and (ii) [a deficiency] in meditative	1
development due to defectiveness in the formative forces that facilitate	1
relinquishment. (d) The non-engendering of [the elements] conducive	1
to liberation is [an obscuration] to the faculties. (e) The excessive	1
weakness of those faculties is [an obscuration] to the powers because	1
of their contamination by adverse elements. (f) The fault of false view	1
is [obscuration] to the limbs of enlightenment because they characterize	1
the path of vision. (g) The fault of disquiet is [an obscuration] to the	1

contribute to [enlightenment are explained] according to the differentiation of the latter	1

(a) Lack of skill in regard to the	1
foundation, (b) laziness etc.	1
The factors that contribute to enlightenment are common in this respect because both	1
the śrävakas and bodhisattvas are entitled to them167 without a specific distinction [as	1
to activity]168. However, the perfections and the spiritual levels, which consist in the	1
activity pertinent to the bodhisattvas, are not common [to all] because only the	1
bodhisattvas have sovereign power over them. Moreover, the obscuration to the result	1
was previously described by way of the obscuration to the cause of virtue etc.; how-	1
ever, what is other than what was discussed previously is mentioned (now] since it is	1
the immediate obscuration to the result [that is discussed] here. Alternatively, since	1
such [qualities] as the lack of skill in regard to the foundation is indeed different from	1
the lack of application etc., this difference is discussed. Alternatively, when virtue and	1
enlightenment [were discussed in the previous section] the lack of application etc. to	1
conduct and its result, which go together with the expedients of the bodhisattvas alone,	0
were described as obscurations. Here in this section however, by means of an analysis	1
165 The danda between dvayahinata and paripurya (N33.10) should be omitted, and, although both	0

tatrāvikarat.	1
168 Tib. (D232a.5) inserts bya ba (kriyā / karaṇa) which is not found in the Sanskrit.Y91	1
of the factors that contribute to enlightenment etc., the lack of skill in regard to the	0
foundation etc. should be understood as an obscuration to virtue, whether common or	1
not common [to all spiritual lineages], that is different from the lack of application etc.	1
Therein, enlightenment is threefold according to its differentiation among the śrāvakas	1
etc. and since they conform with these [three], [those qualities] beginning with the	1
applications of mindfulness and concluding with the path169 are described 170 as the	1
factors that contribute to enlightenment. The ten perfections and the ten spiritual levels	1
[are described] in accordance with the Sutras.	1
[2] Lack of skill in regard to the foundation is an obscuration to the	1
applications of mindfulness. Moreover, this refers to the four applications of the	1
mindfulness of: (a) budy, (b) sensation, (c) mind and (d) the dharmas. The body,	1
sensation, mind and the dharmas form the foundation of these [four applications of	1
mindfulness] because they have these for their object. Therein, the body forms the	1
foundation for notional attachment to a '[physical] basis'. Sensation forms the founda-	1
tion for notional attachment to the enjoyments that belong to the self. Mind forms the	1
foundation for notional attachment to the belief in the self. The dharmas171 form the	1
foundation for notional attachment to the defilement and purification of the self.	1
Absence of understanding in regard to the individual and general characteristics of the	1
body etc. is [equivalent to] lack of skill in this regard. Therein, the individual charac-	1
teristic of the body refers to its nature as a composite of many impure substances ¹72.	1
The [individual characteristic] of sensation refers to its essential nature consisting in	1
pleasure etc. The individual characteristic] of consciousness refers to its various	1
representations as sense-objects. The [individual characteristic] of the dharmas is in	1
accordance with the context [i.e. pure or impure]. Furthermore, the general charac-	1
teristic refers to the aspects such as impermanent, painful, empty and not-self. Alter-	1
natively, lack of skill in regard to the foundation refers either to: (a) lack of knowledge	1
in regard to the body etc. in its aspects as impure, painful, impermanent and without	1
self, or (b) conceptual differentiation [in regard to the body etc.] in terms of the aspects	1
of purity, pleasure, permanence and a self, because nescience or wrong view are	1
[respective] obscurations to the applications of mindfulness. [Objection]: If the appli-	1
cations of mindfulness have wisdom and mindfulness for their own-being, why is only	1
the lack of skill in regard to the foundation described as an obscuration but not also the	1
absence of memory in regard to the foundation? [Response]: Because the activity [of	1
mindfulness] is dependent upon wisdom; for thus, since wisdom consists in vision,	1

mindfulness etc. acts upon an objective support that is attained subsequently to wisdom	0
but does not exist independently, like wisdom. Therefore, the absence of memory is	1
not described as an obscuration in this regard.	1
[3] Laziness is [an obscuration] to the complete relinquishments. The	1
topic under discussion is the obscurations. Vigour receives the title of 'complete relin-	1
quishment in this context when it is occupied with: (a) the relinquishment of adverse	1
elements that have [already] arisen and the non-origination of those which have not yet	1
arisen, and (b) the augmentation of the counteragent that has [already] arisen and the	1
production of those which have not yet arisen. Although the latter cannot be differen-	1
tiated, they are respectively determined as fourfold due to the differentiation in	1
result. 173 Consequently, since the complete relinquishments consist in vigour, sloth-	0
fulness is described as an obscuration.	1
[4] The two deficiencies in meditative concentration are [obscurations]	1
to the bases of psychic power. It is described as psychic power (rddhi) since	0
[the bodhisattva] becomes successful (rdhyate) by means of this. Moreover, it consists	1
in the meditative concentrations of will-power, vigour, mind and examination. This is	1
the base of psychic power because it is the support for the psychic powers such as	1
travelling 174 through space and [the performance of] magical creations. Alternatively,	1
psychic power (rddhi) is [equivalent to] moving (ardana)175; what is meant is: a power	1
such as traveling through space. The bases of these are the bases of psychic power	1
because they form its foundation. The latter refers to meditative concentration and is of	1
four kinds beginning with the meditative concentration of will-power. Will-power is	1
the essential feature in this meditative concentration of will-power because one attains	1
meditative concentration by means of it. However, it is not that vigour and the others	1
are absent therein for they do accompany will-power, but since they are not essential	1
features in the latter [i.e. in the chandasamadhi], they are not proclaimed. The same	1
should be said for the meditative concentrations of vigour, mind and examination. The	1
two deficiencies in meditative concentration were described as obscurations and since	1
these are not known, he says: namely, (a) [a deficiency] in completeness 176	1
due to defectiveness in either will-power, vigour, mind or examination	0
and (b) [a deficiency] in meditative development due to defectiveness in	1
the formative forces that facilitate relinquishment. The deficiency in com-	1
pleteness in this regard is due to the absence of any one of: will-power, vigour, mind	1
and examination, because meditative concentration does not occur due to the power of	1

that [absence] 177. As to the deficiency in meditative development, this is due to the	0
absence of any one of the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment. More-	1
over, the latter have the nature of faith, will-power, vigour, tranquillity, mindfulness,	1
full awareness, volition and equanimity Since mastery in meditative concentration	1
is obtained by means of the meditative development of these formative forces that	1
facilitate relinquishment and not by any other means, hence, because there is a	1
deficiency in meditative development due to their absence, mastery over meditative	1
development is not obtained. What are the obscurations here? (a) That which is	1
adverse to will-power etc. and (b) secondary defilement that is adverse to the formative	1
forces which facilitate relinquishment, namely, laziness, forgetfulness in regard to an	1
objective support, indolence, excitability, the absence of formative force and the	1
[presence of] formative force.	1
[5] The non-engendering of [the elements] conducive to liberation is [an	1
obscuration] to the faculties. The root of the wholesome which one who is	1
afraid of samsāra179 produces for the sake of liberation is described as 'conducive to	1
liberation' since the assurance of obtaining liberation is on account of that. And since	1
faith etc. receive the title of 'faculties' when it is engendered and not otherwise, hence ¹80	0
the non-engendering of [the roots of the wholesome] that are conducive to liberation is	1
described as the obscuration to the faculties. What are the obscurations here? They are	1
that: (a) attachment to a new existence and (b) fear in regard to nirvana. [which occur	1
when the root of the wholesome] which is conducive to liberation is not generated on	1
account of any secondary defilement 181.	1
[6] The excessive weakness of those faculties is [an obscuration] to the	1
powers. The topic under discussion is obscuration. 182 How then can there be an	1
excessive weakness of the faculties? Consequently, he says: because of their	1
contamination ¹83 by adverse elements; what is meant is: they are overcome	1
by adverse elements which have the nature of lack of faith, laziness, loss of mindful-	1
ness, distraction and a weakness in wisdom 185. The faculties are nurtured by the state	1

of 'heat' and the state of the 'summit'186; and although these two [states] are conducive	0
to penetration, they become excessively weak because they are overcome by adverse	1
elements such as lack of faith. Hence there is the possibility of loss through that187.	1
However faith and the like receive the title of 'powers' in the states 188 of the 'receptivity	1
to knowledge and the highest [worldly]189 realization' because the adverse elements	1
have been vanquished. Hence whatever excessive weakness there is in those	1
[faculties] such as faith, when they are overcome by adverse elements in the states of	1
'heat' and the 'summit'190, that is an obstruction to the powers because when it exists	0
there is no possibility of a condition of power191. What are the obscurations here?	1
Just those adverse [elements] such as lack of faith.	1
[7] The fault of false view is [an obscuration] to the limbs of enlight-	1
enment. The fact that obscuration [is the subject under discussion] remains in force	1
here ¹92, Enlightenment here is intended as [equivalent to the path of vision and since	1
these seven limbs of enlightenment which have the nature of mindfulness, the investi-	1
gation of the Dharma, vigour, joy, tranquillity, meditative concentration and equanimity	1
arise at the time of the relinquishment of moral defilement that is to be relinquished by	1
means of [the path of] vision, they are described as the limbs of the latter¹93 [i.e. of	1
enlightenment]. However, if they were [described as] limbs because they are	1
favourable to enlightenment then the applications of mindfulness and the like would	1
also be limbs of enlightenment. How can the fault of false view be an obscuration to	1
the limbs of enlightenment? Hence he says: because they are nurtured by the	1
path of vision; what is meant is: because they are respectively determined by the	1
path of vision. What then is this fault of false view? (a) The five imaginary views, (b)	1
doubt, (c) ignorance, (d) the moral defilements and secondary defilements together	1
with their associates such as passion, which have the latter [i.e. a, b & c] for their	1
objective support. [Objection]: Is it not so that doubt and the like are also obscurations	1
in this respect? [Response]: Admittedly these are obscurations, however, here194 he	1

annunciates the fault of false view 195 by laying the stress on its essential features, thus	1
the absence of an exposition of these [elements, i.e. doubt etc.] is not contradictory.	1
Moreover, of these [elements] beginning with false view, it is just the 'seed' lodged in	1
the store-consciousness that is described as an obscuration to those [limbs of enlight-	1
enment] because it is to be relinquished 196 by means of the path of vision.	1
[8] The fault of disquiet is mentioned as the obscuration to the limbs of the	1
path, which are enumerated as: correct view, correct intention, correct speech, correct	1
action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness and correct meditative	1
concentration 197. Here now he provides the reason: because those limbs of the path	0
are characterized by the path of meditative development, because they are	1
respectively determined by the path of meditative development. What is the fault of	1
disquiet? In detail it refers to: (a) the innate false views of individuality and grasping	1
of extremes together with their associated elements and (b) the moral defilements and	1
secondary defilements of passion etc. together with their associated elements, which	1
have the former [i.e. (a)] as well as the sense-objects for their objective supports. The	1
'seed' of these, which is lodged in the store-consciousness, is disquiet. However, in	1
brief, it refers to the impurities other than those which are to be relinquished by means	1
of [the path of] vision. The force of those [impurities], which is lodged in the store-	1
consciousness, is disquiet. Moreover, this is determined as an obscuration to the limbs	1
of the path since it is to be relinquished by means of the path of meditative develop-	1
ment. The obscuration to the factors that contribute to enlightenment has now been	1
described.	1
b. The Obscurations to the Perfections.	1
The obscurations to the perfections are:	1

Obscurations to: (a) dominion, (b)	1

(f) liberation, (g) imperishability, (h)	1
the continuity of virtue, (i) the assur-	0
ance of [the arising of the latter] and	1
(j) enjoyment of the Dharma and	1
causing maturation.	0
Here the obscurations that pertain to the ten perfections are shown	1
by way of the particular obscuration to the relevent result of each	1
perfection. Of these, (a) the obscuration to dominion and sovereignty	1
is an obscuration [to the result]198 of the perfection of generosity. (b)	1
The obscuration to propitious states of existence is [an obscuration to	1
the result of the perfection of morality. (c) be obscuration to the	1
non-abandonment of sentient beings is [an obscuration to the result] of	1
the perfection of patience. (d) The obscuration to the diminution of	1
faults and the augmentation of virtues is [an obscuration to the result]	1
of the perfection of vigour. (e) The obscuration to the guidance of	1
those to be trained is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of	1
the meditative absorptions. (f) The obscuration to liberation is [an	1
obscuration to the result of the perfection of wisdom. (g) The obscu-	1
ration to the imperishability of generosity etc. is [an obscuration to the	1
result of the perfection of skill in regard to expedients because its	1
imperishability is on account of the transformation into enlightenment.	1
(h) The obscuration to the uninterrupted emergence of the wholesome in	1
all rebirths is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of vows	1
because the possession of a rebirth that is favourable to this is on	1
account of the strength of vows. (i) The obscuration to the assurance	1
[of the arising] of those wholesome [elements] is [an obscuration to the	1
result] of the perfection of the powers because [the bodhisattva] is not	1
overcome by adverse elements on account of his powers of critical	1
consideration and meditative development. () The obscuration to both	1
the enjoyment of the Dharma for himself and causing the maturation of	0
others is an obscuration [to the result of the perfection of direct intu-	1
ition because the understanding [by the bodhisattva] of the meaning of	1
what he has learnt is not in accord with the letter.	1
[1] Immediately following the latter [i.e. the obscurations to the factors that contribute	1
to enlightenment], [the obscurations] to the perfections should be mentioned. Hence he	1
Tib. (D9a.2) inserts bras bu which is not found in the Ms.Y95	0

II.12 ab	0
Obscurations to: (a) dominion, (b)	1
propitious states of existence, (c) the	1
non-abandonment of sentient	1
beings! etc.	1
Here the obscurations that pertain to the ten perfections are shown by	1
way of the particular obscuration to the relevent result of each perfec-	1
tion. What is the reason that here avarice and the like, which exist substantially as	1
impediments 200 to generosity etc., are not described as obscurations to the perfections	1
although they are [described as] obscurations to the result of the relevent (perfection]?	1
All [people] engage in generosity and the like for the sake of its result201; therefore, in	1
order to generate interest in the relinquishment of avarice etc., the obscuration to the	1
result is mentioned but the obscuration to the perfection not. Alternatively, obscura-	1
tion such as avarice which is adverse to dominion and which produces a result	1
consisting in poverty etc., impedes a result such as dominion202, thus it is described as	1
an obscuration to the latter. What are the results of those [perfections]? In this	1
respect the chief results of the perfection of generosity are dominion and	1
sovereignty. The [chief result] of the perfection of morality is a propitious state	1
of existence. The [chief result] of the perfection of patience is the non-aban-	1
donment of sentient beings. The [chief result] of the perfection of vigour is the	1
diminution of faults and the augmentation of virtues. The [chief result] of the	1
perfection of meditative absorption is guidance for sentient beings in scriptural	1
instruction. The [chief result] of the perfection of wisdom is liberation for those	1
who have been guided203. The [chief result] of the perfection of skill in regard	1
to expedients is the imperishability of the wholesome on account of its transfor-	1
mation into enlightenment. The [chief result] of the perfection of vows is uninter-	1
rupted virtue. The [chief result] of the perfection of the powers is the assurance	1
[of the arising] of wholesome dharmas. The [chief result] of the perfection of	1
direct intuition is the enjoyment of the Dharma and the maturation of sentient	1
beings.	1

[2] The obscuration to dominion and sovereignty204; therein, dominion refers	1
to an abundance of wealth and property. Sovereignty refers to the power that comes	1
from the enjoyment of the latter. The obscuration to these two is an obscuration	1
pertinent to the perfection of generosity because they result from that. What then is this	1
[obscuration]? It is avarice.	1
[3] The obscuration to the propitious states of existence; a propitious state	1
of existence refers to an excellent state of existence either among mankind or the	1
gods205. The obscuration to this is an obscuration pertinent to the perfection of moral-	1
ity because [propitious states of existence] result from that. Moreover, this	1
[obscuration] consists in: (a) immorality and (b) contemptible actions of body and	1
speech.	1
[4] [The obscuration] to the non-abandonment of sentient beings; i.e.	1
treating [even] offensive sentient beings just like those who are helpful. And this is the	1
result of [the perfection of 206 patience; the obscuration to this is anger.	1
[5] [The obscuration] to the diminution of faults and the augmentation	1

[elements] that have not yet arisen. The augmentation [of virtues]207 refers to the	1
growth of [elements] that have already arisen which manifest for the benefit of oneself	1
and others and the origination of [elements] that have not yet arisen. What then is the	1
obscuration here? It is laziness.	1
[6] The obscuration to the guidance of those to be trained...; i.e. guidance	1

through appeasement, sentient beings effortlessly understand the scriptural instruction	1
on account of: (a) reading the thoughts of others, (b) their psychic power208; and	1
distraction is the obscuration here.	0
[7] The obscuration to liberation; liberation consists in the relinquishment of	1

consequently, liberation is the result of the perfection of wisdom. The obscurations to	0
this are: (a) defiled wisdom, (b) delusion and (c) a weakness in wisdom.	1
[8] The obscuration to the imperishability of generosity etc.210; an obscu-	1
ration to the imperishability of generosity and morality etc. is an obscuration pertinent	1
to the perfection of expedients. Moreover, as to how generosity etc. can be imperish-	1
able, he says: because its imperishability is on account of the transfor-	1
mation into enlightenment. The root of the wholesome such as generosity which	1
is transformed into universal enlightenment, like Buddhahood, does not perish,. Some	1
believe that this obscuration consists in a lack of knowledge of the expedients which	1
characterize the transformation into universal enlightenment. Others believe that this	1
obscuration consists in the grasping of the three components [of giving]211 which is	1
[equivalent to] lack of skill in regard to expedients.	1
[9] The obscuration to the uninterrupted 212 emergence of the wholesome	1
in all rebirths; the uninterrupted [emergence] of the wholesome is [equivalent to its	1
emergence] day by day or moment by moment. And this is the result of the perfection	1
of vows. As to why this is so, he says: because the possession²	1
213 of rebirth	0
that is favourable to this is on account of the strength of vows; for [the	0
bodhisattva] takes a rebirth that is congenial to the uninterrupted emergence of	1
generosity etc. through the strength of his vows. Obscuration to this consists in the	1
absence of vows in relation to a rebirth favourable to generosity etc.	1
[10] The obscuration to the assurance214 [of the arising] of those whole-	1
some [elements]; assurance consists in the combining [of the three: vīrya, samadhi	0
and prajñāļ215 day by day and moment by moment. Here now he gives the reason:	1
because [the bodhisattva] is not overcome by adverse [elements] on	0
account of his powers of critical consideration and meditative develop-	1
ment. The power of critical consideration here consists in wisdom accompanied by	1
steadfastness. Furthermore, steadfastness is a designative dharma since it is a designa-	1
tion applicable to the innate trio of vigour216, meditative concentration and wisdom.	1
The power of meditative development [is mentioned here] because [the bodhisattva)	1
engages in generosity etc., effortlessly, through his possession of habitual practice	1

216 Ms.(28b.4): vīryasa-; disregard Y's fn.2 p.96.	1
because he is not overcome by avarice which is the counteragent to this [power of	0
meditative development]. What are the obscurations here? (a) The absence of critical	1
consideration217 and (b) weakness in meditative development.	1
[11] The obscuration to the enjoyment of the Dharma for himself and	1
causing the maturation of others; the results are: (a) the enjoyment of the	0
profound and sublime Dharma of the universal vehicle by one who is situated in the	1
circles of the assembly which pertain to enjoyment218 and (b) causing the maturation 219	1
of sentient beings through teaching the Dharma by acts of transformation in their	1
various aspects220. Moreover, the obscurations to this are: (a) deliberation upon the	1
meaning of what has been learnt, according to the letter221 and (b) sluggish wisdom.	1
And so ends the obscurations [to the perfections].	1
[12] Although, substantially there are six perfections herein, nominally there are ten²22	1
since four perfections are constituted by the perfection of wisdom. The perfection of	1
wisdom therein consists in supramundane direct intuition devoid of conceptual differ-	1
entiation; the gradual relinquishment of all obscuration is on account of that direct	1
intuition. Furthermore, the perfections of expedients, vows, the powers and direct	1
intuition are incorporated in direct intuition that is attained subsequently to the supra-	1
mundane path. How is it that the perfection of direct intuition, although it is pre-	1
eminent, is not devoid of conceptual differentiation? Because the perfection of direct	1
intuition consists in that direct intuition attained subsequently to the direct intuition that	1
is devoid of conceptual differentiation and after precisely defining his understanding by	1
means of that direct intuition223, [the bodhisattva] experiences in return the enjoyment	1
of the Dharma for himself and brings others to maturation. And since this duality [i.e.	1
self/others subject/object] is non-existent in [direct intuition] devoid of conceptual	1
differentiation, consequently, the perfection of direct intuition is not without conceptual	1
differentiation. The obscurations to the perfections have now been described.	1

c. The Obscurations to the Spiritual Levels.	1
Moreover, [the obscurations] to the spiritual levels are, respectively:	1
In regard to: (a) the meaning as all-	0
pervading, (b) the meaning as pre-	1
eminent, (c) the meaning as pre-	1
eminent that flows out, (d) the	1
meaning as devoid of possession, (e)	0
[the meaning] as non-differentiation	1
in mental continuum.	1
II.14 abcd	1
II.15 abcd	1
II.16 abcd	1
(f) The meaning as devoid of defile-	1
ment and purification, (g) the mean-	1
ing as devoid of multiplicity, (h) the	1
meaning as neither diminished nor	1
increased and (i) the basis of the	1
four kinds of mastery.	1
This ignorance concerning the	1
dharmadhātu, being a tenfold obscu-	0
ration which is undefiled, [acts] in	0
opposition to the ten spiritual levels.	1
However, the spiritual levels are the	1
counteragents.	1
Concerning the dharmadhãātu, there is undefiled nescience in regard	1
to the tenfold meaning, such as all-pervading, which is an obscuration	1
to the ten respective spiritual levels of the bodhisattva because it is	1
"adverse to each of them, namely, ""in regard to the meaning as all-"	1
"pervading"" 224 [and so on as above]. For, (a) by means of the first"	1
spiritual level [the bodhisattva] penetrates the sense of all-pervading on	1
the part of the dharmadhātu; on account of this he obtains in return [the	1
realization] that self and others are equal. (b) By means of the second	1
[he penetrates] its meaning as pre-eminent. On account of this he	0
"believes: ""therefore then, in regard to equality in achievement,"	1
endeavour should be directed by us towards only the achievement of	1
"complete purification in every way""225. (c) By means of the third [he"	1
penetrates] the meaning as pre-eminent that flows out of that	1
[dharmadhātu]. On account of this, after understanding the pre-eminent	1
224 sarvatragarthe is omitted from the Tib.; cf. D9b.2.	0
225 This is a quotation from DS (R26.12) where samăne bhinirhäre is replaced by samabhinirhäre.N36	1
nature of what is learnt and which flows out of the dharmadhatu, he	0
may cast himself into a fire-pit the size of the great trichiliocosm for the	1
sake of them. (d) By means of the fourth [he penetrates] its meaning as	1
devoid of possession, for thus, even his craving for the Dharma is	0
checked. (e) By means of the fifth [he penetrates] its meaning as non-	1
differentiation in mental continuum by reason of the ten equalities in	1
regard to the purity of mind and mental disposition. (f) By means of	1
the sixth [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of defilement and purity	1
as the consequence of his penetration [of the reality] that, regarding the	1
[meaning] 226 of dependent origination, there is no dharma whatsoever	1
that is defiled or purified. (g) By means of the seventh [he penetrates]	1
its meaning as devoid of multiplicity because of the absence of the	0
manifestation of multiplicity by way of sign in the dharmas of the	1
Sutras etc. on account of their signlessness. (h) By means of the eighth	1
[he penetrates] its meaning as neither diminished nor increased as the	0
consequence of his acquisition of patient acceptance in regard to non-	1
originating dharmas since, in regard to defilement and purification, he	1
fails to perceive either the diminution or augmentation of any dharma	1
whatsoever 227. (i) Mastery is fourfold: (a) mastery over the absence of	0
conceptual differentiation, (b) mastery over the complete purification of	1
the field, (c) mastery over direct intuition and (d) mastery over karma.	1
In this respect, by means of just the eighth spiritual level he penetrates	1
[the reality that the dharmadhātu forms the basis of the first and	0
second masteries. On the ninth [he penetrates the reality that it forms	1
the basis for mastery over direct intuition due to his acquisition of	1
analytical knowledge. On the tenth [he penetrates the reality that it	1
forms the basis for mastery over karma as the consequence of his	1
working for the welfare of sentient beings at will through his creative	1
transformations.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y97.11 [1] Immediately following the latter [i.e. the obscurations to the perfections], [the	1
obscurations] to the spiritual levels should be mentioned. Hence he says: moreover,	1
[the obscurations] to the spiritual levels228 are, respectively:	1
226 The Tib. inserts artha which is not found in the Ms.; i.e., it reads: rten cin brel bar byun ba'i	1

II.14 a	1
In regard to: (a) the meaning as all-	1
pervading, (b) the meaning as pre-	1
eminent 229 etc.	1
In this respect there are ten spiritual levels: (1) The Joyous, (2) The Stainless, (3) The	1
Radiance Giving, (4) The Brilliant, (5) The Very Difficult to Conquer, (6) The Face to	1
Face, (7) The Far Reaching, (8) The Immovable, (9) The Good Discernment and (10)	1
The Cloud of the Dharma. The particular stages of understanding in regard to the	0
dharmadhātu in the sense of all-pervading etc. are described as the spiritual levels in	1
their nature as: (a) a locus for ever increasing understanding230 and (b) the foundation	1
for virtues that have arisen from the latter. Others believe that in whichever state	1
(vihāra) the bodhisattva dwells (viharati) for an extended period in regard to [his	1
understanding] of the dharmadhātu in the sense of all-pervading etc., by virtue of the	1
fact that he abides in that particular state it is called a spiritual level. Furthermore, the	1
arrangement of the spiritual levels231 [is as follows]: On the Joyous, the bodhisattva	1
achieves the direct realization of the Dharma due to the arising of the path of vision.	1
On the Stainless, [the bodhisattva] who has achieved the direct realization of the	1
Dharma232 accomplishes a special training consisting in a superior morality that flows	1
spontaneously because of his abstention from the immorality that stems from all subtle	1
transgressions. On the Radiance Giving, he accomplishes a special training that	1
consists in a superior mentality in regard to both the Dharma and karma that does not	1
cease even in other rebirths. On the Brilliant, the Very Difficult to Conquer and the	1
Face to Face [levels] he accomplishes a special training consisting in a superior	1
wisdom which has for its objective support: (a) the factors that contribute to enlight-	1
enment, (b) the [noble] truths and (c) dependent origination. These latter trainings	1
should be understood to have four kinds of result on the [four] remaining spiritual	1
levels: Of these, on the Far Reaching he accomplishes with effort233 the state of the	1
direct intuition of the signless. On the Immovable, he accomplishes without effort the	1
state of the direct intuition of the signless together with the purification of the 'field'.	1
On the Good Discernment, he accomplishes the special quality of analytical knowledge	1
and it is on account of this that he preaches the Dharma234. On the Cloud of the	1

Dharma [level] he achieves the special qualities of meditative concentration and [the	0
knowledge of] mystical formulae.	1
[2] Concerning the dharmadhātu,...in regard to the tenfold meaning	1
such as all-pervading, 235... The sense of all-pervading etc. in regard to the	1
dharmadhātu is understood by way of the ten spiritual levels of the bodhisattva.	1
Undefiled nescience in regard to that [meaning] is a tenfold obscuration to the	1
ten respective spiritual levels of the bodhisattva because it is adverse to	1
each of them, i.e. because it is adverse to each of the spiritual levels; for the spiritual	1
levels consist in special states236 of supramundane meditative concentration and	1
wisdom etc. Undefiled nescience is adverse [to these states] because it impedes their	1
arising. Moreover, it is not just undefiled nescience that is an obscuration in this	1
context, on the contrary, other moral defilements and secondary defilements are	1
[obscurations] as well. For thus, everything on the Joyous [level] to be relinquished	0
by the path of vision is an obscuration because all propensities for wrong insight in	1
regard to the [noble] truths are relinquished by the path of vision which brings about	1
an understanding237 of the sense of all-pervading. Furthermore, those [propensities] to	1
be relinquished through meditative development [are done so] by way of the remaining	1
spiritual levels. However, those [propensities] that have not been relinquished are just	1
like the ones that have been relinquished since they do not cause defilement on the part	1
of the bodhisattvas. With reference to this very matter, a verse has been composed:	1
Moral defilement becomes a limb of	0
enlightenment for one who employs the	1
mighty expedients and even samsāra has the	0
nature of appeasement. Consequently, the	1
tathāgata is inconceivable.	0
"Moreover, because of the statement: ""on the ten spiritual levels the ten perfections are"	1
"successively more excellent"", it is evident that there is also the successive relinquish-"	1
ment of those elements, beginning with avarice, which are adverse to each [level].	1
[Objection]: If other238 moral defilement may also be an obscuration, why is only	1
undefiled nescience described as the obscuration to the spiritual levels? [Response]:	1
Because it is not common to everyone since it acts as an impediment239 to the attain-	1
ment of nirvāṇa only for bodhisattvas, but not for śrävakas etc. Thus, the śrävakas and	1
pratyekabuddhas become liberated in spite of its [i.e. undefiled nescience's] presence,	1

but not the bodhisattva; hence, it is not common to all. However, since moral defile-	0
ment applies equally to bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc., the fact that [undefiled	1
nescience] is an obscuration is not annulled even though there is no mention of it [in	1
other works] since it is not posited nor rejected as an obscuration to the spiritual levels	1
of the bodhisattva, considering that it is described as an obscuration to the spiritual	1
levels and that it is not the only obscuration to the spiritual levels. Others say that since	1
undefiled nescience pertains equally to the bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc., it is	1
mentioned especially as an obscuration to the spiritual levels; however, moral defile-	1
ment follows as a consequence therefore it is not mentioned. [Reply]: Although moral	1
defilement is indeed equally applicable to the bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc. it therefore	1
need not necessarily follow. Others again believe240 that although the obscuration	1
consisting in the nescience of the spiritual levels is an undefiled nescience pertinent to	1
the śrävakas, it does not act as an impediment to liberation because the śrävakas	1
become liberated even though the nescience in regard to the spiritual levels is present.	1
However, [such a nescience] is defiled for the bodhisattva since it is the cause of an	1
impediment to the attainment of nirvana.	1
[3] Others believe this is not so:	1
II.16b	0
Being a tenfold obscuration that is	1
undefiled.	1
Because, by means of the first spiritual level [the bodhisattva] pene-	1
trates the sense of all-pervading on the part of the dharmadhātu.	1
Therein, the first spiritual level refers to the first supramundane wisdom, together with	1
its associated elements and is incorporated in the path of vision. The dharmadhatu is	1
[equivalent to] emptiness since, by virtue of its being a universal characteristic, it is in	1
one place just as it is everywhere. It is all-pervading because it extends everywhere.	1
"The statement: ""since no dharma is to be found outside the dharmadhâtu""241, shows"	1
"that the dharmadhātu is all-pervading. By ""penetrates"" is meant: 'realizes'. On"	1
account of that242 penetration he obtains in return [the realization] that self	1
and others are equal243. As the consequence of his insight into the fact that the	1
emptiness in regard to self and others cannot be differentiated, he reflects upon the fact	1
"that self and others are not different [thinking]: ""what is self is other"", or ""what is other"	1
"is self"". It is only because of this that the perfection of generosity is more excellent on"	1
this spiritual level, consequently, on this [level] the bodhisattva is just as occupied with	1

(4] By means of the second [he penetrates] its meaning as foremost; the	1

aspect of wisdom, ...they lead up to the śrävaka vehicle. Then, when they are	1
purified to a greater degree, ...they lead up to the pratyekabuddha vehicle. Then,	1
when they are purified even more247, ...they lead to: (a) the complete purity of	1
the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva, (b) the complete purity 248 of the perfec-	1
tions and (c) extensiveness in courses. Then, when they are purified to a	0
greater degree, they lead up to the force of the ten powers 249 since they are	1
completely purified in every way250... Therefore then, in regard to equality in	1
achievement [endeavour should be directed by us...].251	1
"The words ""therefore then etc."" signify that since [the bodhisattva] has this thought on"	1
the second spiritual level, therefore it is known that he penetrates the meaning [of the	1
"dharmadhatu] as foremost by way of the second [level]. ""Achievement"" is [equivalent"	1
"to] effort or deed. ""Complete purification in every way"" is [equivalent to] the removal"	1
of both defiled and undefiled delusion in regard to the dharmadhātu. Consequently,	1
the perfection of morality is more excellent on this spiritual level because the self	1
becomes, still more so, a fit vessel252 [for purity 1253 on account of the desire for the	1
pre-eminent meaning [of the dharmadhātu].	1

[5] By means of the third [he penetrates the meaning as pre-eminent	1
that flows out of that [dharmadhātu]. That he penetrates it is understood,	0
because the statements of the Buddha are characterized by their penetration of the	1
dharmadhâtu; for thus254, the Dharma teachings such as the Sūtras which flow out of	1
the dharmadhātu are characterized by the power of the dharmadhātu known as the	1
Dharma Body which is completely pure in every way. This is because of both the pre-	1
eminent nature of the Dharma teachings that flow out of that255 [dharmadhātu] and also	1
the fact that they [i.e. the Dharma teachings] are the cause of the complete purification	1
of the dharmadhâtu on account of the pre-eminent nature of the dharmadhatu. On	1
account of that256, after understanding the pre-eminent nature of what is	1
"learnt and which flows out of the dharmadhātu...; by ""on account of that"" 257,"	1
"[is meant]: on account of the penetration of the dharmadhatu; by ""what is learnt"" [is"	1
"meant]: the Dharma such as the Sūtras that are learnt; by ""after understanding the pre-"	1

tively as such through direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation; ...for the	1
sake of them, i.e. for the sake of hearing the statements of the Buddha, he may	1
cast himself into the fire-pit the size of the great trichiliocosm, for it is	1
said in a Sutra: 258	1
"If someone were to say the following 259: ""Thus I would proclaim to you this"	1
portion of the Dharma presented by the Perfectly Enlightened One which	1
facilitates complete purification in the conduct of the bodhisattva if you were to	1
throw 260	1
yourself into the great fire-pit which blazes up261 into a single flame	1
and you should take upon your own body the great262 suffering of the sensation	1

places of woe266 we should seek all1267 the Buddha Dharmas, even at the price	1
"of associating with [just] human suffering""."	1
It is because of this that the perfection of patience is more excellent on this spiritual	1
level since [the bodhisattva] endures all moral defilement268 for the sake of what is	1
learnt.	1
[6] By means of the fourth [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of	1
possession 269. It is understood that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharma-	1
dhātu. On the fourth spiritual level, because of its evenness, he penetrates [the	1
meaning] of the dharmadhātu as an absence of what pertains to the self, since there is	1
no sense of 'mine' whatsoever on the part of the dharmadhātu270. Alternatively, [the	1
dharmadhātu] is not in the possession of anyone because it is not an object of all	1
erroneous inversion; since it is free from erroneous inversion in itself, there is no	1
possession whatsoever on its behalf. For thus271, even his craving for the	1
Dharma is checked; this is a statement from scriptural tradition. In this way, due to	1
his understanding of the dharmadhātu272 through direct intuition free from conceptual	1
elaboration, he acquires the dharmas consisting in the factors that contribute to enlight-	1
enment on the Brilliant [level] and even that craving for the Dharma of the Sūtras etc.	1
which existed previously on the part of the bodhisattva, is checked. Others believe that	1
the craving for the Dharma refers to meditative absorption, meditative concentration	1
and the attainments. Therefore, on this spiritual level the perfection of vigour is more	1
excellent because [the bodhisattva] dwells perpetually in company with the factors that	1
contribute to enlightenment273 when both speech and discursive thought have been	1
transcended. 274	1
[7] By means of the fifth [he penetrates] its meaning as non-differen-	1
tiation in mental continuum275; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of	1

the dharmadhātu that is referred to. He sees the mutual276 sameness of non-differen-	0
tiation277 between himself and the mental continuum of all the Buddhas, the Venerable	1
Ones 278, of the past, present and future as well as that of the bodhisattvas. By reason	1
of the ten equalities in regard to the purity of mind and mental disposi-	1
tion279; he demonstrates scriptural tradition by this statement. [The full passage reads	1
as follows]:280	1
By reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning	1
the Dharma of the Buddhas of the past, by reason of equality in regard to the	1
purity of mental disposition concerning the Dharma of the Buddhas of the	1
future281, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition	1
concerning the Dharma of the Buddhas of the present, by reason of equality in	1
regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning morality, by reason of	1
equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning mind 282,	1
reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the	1
removal of false view, doubt, perplexity and annoyance, by reason of equality	1
in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the knowledge of what	1
is the path and what is not the path, by reason of equality in regard to the purity	1
of mental disposition concerning the knowledge of spiritual practice and	1
renunciation283, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposi-	1
tion concerning the ever increasing development of all dharmas that contribute	1
to enlightenment284 and by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental	1
disposition concerning the maturation of all sentient beings 285.	1
[The bodhisattva] penetrates 286 the non-differentiation in mental continuum by reason	1
of these equalities because the Dharma Body, which is characterized287 by a turning	1
about of the store-consciousness, is undifferentiated. Therefore, on this spiritual level	1
the perfection of meditative absorption is more excellent due to the abundance of	1
meditative development in regard to the aspects of the [noble] truths, in an absolute	1
sense.	1

[8] By means of the sixth [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of	1
defilement and purity; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharma-	1
dhātu that is referred to. The characteristic of dependent origination is defilement. The	1
[dharmadhātu] is not intrinsically defiled because [defilement] is adventitious to it, nor	1
is it purified because it is intrinsically pure. Thus he penetrates the dharmadhātu in the	1
form of being understood in himself through direct intuition that is free from	1
conceptual differentiation. Here now he demonstrates scriptural tradition: as the	1
consequence of his penetration2 288 [of the reality] that, regarding depend-	1
ent origination, there is no dharma whatsoever that is defiled or	1
purified. On the sixth spiritual level the bodhisattva analyses dependent origination	1
and penetrates [the reality] in regard to the latter that no dharma whatsoever is defiled	1
or purified, because: (a) the dharmadhātu is luminous by nature, (b) defilement is only	1
pertinent to the limbs of dependent origination and (c) with the exception of the latter289	1
there exists no other self or what pertains to a self in regard to which defilement or	0
purity can be construed. It is only because of this that290 the perfection of wisdom is	1
more excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva] understands the	1
profoundness of dependent origination in the sense of the absence of defilement and	1
purity.	1
[9] By means of the seventh [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of	1
multiplicity; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharmadhātu that is	1
referred to. On this spiritual level the bodhisattva is victorious due to the absence of	1
the manifestation of all signs. And since multiplicity manifests by way of the mani-	0
festation of signs, hence it is said that by means of the seventh [level] he penetrates the	1
meaning of the dharmadhātu as devoid of multiplicity due to the absence of the mani-	0
festation of signs. In order to demonstrate this very meaning, he says: because of	1
the absence of the manifestation of multiplicity by way of sign in the	1
dharmas of the Sūtras etc291. Up to the sixth spiritual level [the bodhisattva]	1
enters the dharmadhātu by means of the signs of the dharmas [explained in the Sūtras	1
etc., [signs] which manifest themselves forcefully in their diversity as the [two] know-	1
ledges, i.e. that which consists in the entry into [the dharmadhātu] and that which is	1
obtained subsequently to the latter. However, on the seventh spiritual level, since he	1
penetrates [the reality] of the absence of sign on the part of the dharmadhātu through	1
direct intuition in the aspect of the uniformity of all signs, those signs do not become	1
manifest. Consequently, on this spiritual level the perfection of expedients is more	1

excellent since he penetrates [the reality] that all signs are signless and does not contra-	0
dict conventional linguistic usage which is created by signs. Also, as the consequence	1
of his penetration of the latter, in this [level] he obtains supremacy 292	1
[10] By means of the eighth [he penetrates] its meaning as neither	1
diminished nor increased 293; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the	1
dharmadhatu that is referred to, since the dharmadhātu is completely pure by nature	1
because there is no difference between its stained or stainless condition. It is because	1
of this that it is described as thusness (tathata)considering that it is eternally just thus	1
(tathā). Even though it is devoid of sign it does not diminish294; even though it	1
possesses sign it does not increase 295; for thus some believe that the sign itself is sign-	1
less. Here now he gives the reason: as the consequence of his acquisition of	1
patient acceptance in regard to non-originating dharmas. Thus, on the	0
eighth spiritual level the bodhisattva penetrates the fact that there is neither diminution	1
nor increase on the part of the dharmadhatu because he acquires patient acceptance in	1
regard to non-originating dharmas. In regard to defilement and purification,	1
there is neither a diminution nor augmentation of any dharmas whatso-	1
ever296, because there can be no origination of new dharmas.	1
[11] Mastery is fourfold: (a) mastery over the absence of conceptual	1
differentiation, (b) mastery over the complete purification of the 'field',	1
(c) mastery over direct intuition and (d) mastery over karma. Because of	1
the spontaneous absence of the manifestation of all signs therein, the dharmadhātu is to	1
be known as the basis for mastery over direct intuition297 devoid of conceptual differ-	1
entiation. Even on the seventh [level] the non-manifestation of signs is possible by	1
way of formative influence; however, here [on the eighth level] [it is possible] by way	1
of the absence of formative influence [i.e. spontaneously 1298 that is the difference.	1
Also, by means of the eighth [he penetrates the reality] that it is the	1
basis for mastery over the complete purification of the 'field'; the topic under	1
discussion is the fact that he penetrates [this reality] of the dharmadhātu 299. The	1

of kşetraparisuddhivašita (śrayatvam caştamya pra)tividhyatīti prakṛtam. This passage, which isY106	1
dharmadhātu is to be understood as the basis for mastery over the complete purifi-	1
cation of the 'field' because [the bodhisattva] obtains the power to exhibit it at will to	1
the Buddha fields and the circles of assembly 300. Therefore, the perfection of vows is	1
more excellent on this spiritual level due to continual endeavour in regard to the whole-	1
some on account of the acquisition of mastery over both the absence of conceptual	0
differentiation and the 'field'.	1
[12] By means of the ninth 301 [he penetrates the reality] that it forms the	1
basis for mastery over direct intuition; the topic under discussion is the fact	1
that he penetrates [this reality] of the dharmadhatu. How is this discerned that [the	1
bodhisattva] penetrates [the dharmadhātu) as the basis for mastery over direct intuition	1
by the ninth [level]? Due to his acquisition of analytical knowledge³02.	0
Since, on this level, he acquires analytical knowledge consisting in: (a) the Dharma, (b)	1
meaning, (c) grammatical analysis and (d) a ready intellect, which are not obtained by	1
others. Hence here, it is discermed that the penetration of the dharmadhātu is the basis	0
of mastery over direct intuition. Therefore, the perfection of the powers is more	1
excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva] possesses the special power	1
of wisdom.	1
[13] By means of the tenth303 [he penetrates the reality] that it forms the	1
basis of mastery over karma; it is the fact that he penetrates [this reality of the	1
dharmadhātu] that is referred to.304 How is this understood? Hence he says: as the	1
consequence of his working for the welfare of sentient beings at will	1
through his creative transformations. Through this resolve 305 on the tenth	1
spiritual level [the bodhisattva] penetrates [the reality] that the dharmadhātu is the basis	1
of mastery over karma. On account of this he obtains supremacy in regard to the	1
actions of a tathāgata. For thus, like the sugata, through his Transformation Bodies he	1
acts at will doing what is to be done at the appropriate time306 for the sentient beings	1
abiding in the infinite world-spheres of the ten directions. Therefore, the perfection of	1
direct intuition is more excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva]	1
omitted from the Tib., is most likely a partial quotation of the following passage from the	0

possesses the distinctive ability to both enjoy the Dharma and bring sentient beings to	1

[14] In this way the ten spiritual levels of the bodhisattva are respectively determined	1
as the counteragents to undefiled nescience which is an obscuration to each single	1
spiritual level and is also an impediment to the complete purification, in every respect,	1
[which facilitates] the tenfold penetration of the dharmadhatu and which is relevant to	1
these spiritual levels of the bodhisattva as has [just] been described. The peculiar	1
nature of the ninth and tenth spiritual levels is revealed through their results but not	1
through a peculiar penetration of a different objective support307, because [the	1
bodhisattva] in these states reaches a condition which cannot be defined. The purpose	0
of the penetration of the meaning of all-pervading etc. is [for the attainment of] a state	1
of excellence of the ten perfections, respectively, on the ten spiritual levels. Therefore,	1
these obscurations to the spiritual levels that have been described are also said to be	1
obscurations to the state of excellence of the perfections. Alternatively, it is said in a	1
Sūtra that the purpose of penetrating308 the meaning [of the dharmadhātu] as all-	1
pervading etc. is [to attain] the result such as the attainment of meditative concentration	1
which is distinguished by [the attainment of] ever-increasing spiritual levels and which	1
culminates in direct intuition in regard to all aspects.	1

sists in the knowable has now been	1
elucidated.	1
As to how this is understood that in total there are only two and that a third does not	1
exist, he says:	1
II.17 c	0
These are all the obscurations in this	1
regard.	1
The ellipsis is that [all] are included 309. It is understood that all curation is included	1
within the two obscurations; another, i.e. a third, does not exist. Consequently, all	1
obscuration is included herein, hence liberation from all obscuration is con-	1
sidered as being due to the extinction of this twofold obscuration,	1
consisting in both moral defilement and the knowable which comprise all obscuration.	1
What is meant is: one should relinquish all obscuration ³10.	1
[2] Although obscuration to the Buddha level has not been elucidated, is it also	1
included in these [two]? [It is included, however] its inclusion is not due to its direct	1
mention but rather is due to its intrinsic nature. Moreover, it has certainly been	1
mentioned because of the statements about the pervading obscuration; otherwise it	1
would be just a limited obscuration. Alternatively, in order to include³11 the obscu-	1
ration to the Buddha level, he says:	1
II.17 cd	0
These are all the obscurations in this	1
regard. Liberation is considered as	1
being due to their extinction³12.	1
Because there can be no liberation in the absence of the extinction of the obscuration to	1
the Buddha leve!. Hence it has been illustrated that the latter [i.e. obscuration to the	1
Buddha level] is also an obscuration, just like the remaining obscurations. However,	1
undefiled nescience which is a condition of extraordinary subtlety and the latent	0
impressions of moral defilement are described as obscurations to the Buddha level.	1
Therefore, it has been elucidated in this way because it cannot be examined differently	1
due to its extraordinary subtlety.	1

The Summary Meaning of Obscuration.	1
The summary meaning of the obscurations Extensive obscuration	1
refers to the pervading. Minute obscuration refers to the limited.	1
Obscuration to application refers to the excessive. Obscuration to	1
attainment refers to the equal. Obscuration to the special attainment	1
refers to acceptance and rejection.	1
Obscuration to correct application	1
refers to the ninefold obscuration consisting in moral defilement.	1
Obscuration to the [instrumental] causes refers to [the obscuration] to	1
virtue etc. and is due to the influence of the tenfold causal categories³13.	1
Obscuration to the entry into reality refers to [the obscuration] to the	1
factors that contribute to enlightenment. Obscuration to supreme virtue	1
refers to the obscuration] to the perfections. Obscuration to the state	1
of excellence of the latter refers to [the obscuration] to the spiritual	1
levels. The complete collection of obscurations refer to the two types	1
in total.	0
[Sthiramati]	1
Y108.8 Extensive obscuration refers to the pervading; i.e. obscuration that consists in	1
both moral defilement and the knowable which pertains to the spiritual lineages of the	1
bodhisattva. Minute obscuration refers to the limited; i.e. only obscuration	1
that consists in moral defilement and which is pertinent to the spiritual lineages of the	1
śrävaka etc. Obscuration to application refers to the excessive; this pertains	1
only to those who course in passion etc. and it is on account of this that application is	1
not attained. Obscuration to attainment refers to the equal314; this pertains to	1
those who course in equal shares for it acts as an impediment to attainment. Obscu-	1
ration to the special attainment refers to acceptance and rejection³15	1
pertains to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it is the	0
obscuration to a special understanding. The special understanding consists in [the	1
attainment of the nirvāṇa [in which the bodhisattva is] not permanently fixed and this	1
should be understood as a special result. Obscuration to correct application	1
refers to the ninefold characteristics of moral defilement316; since it is	1

stated that the nine fetters are obscurations. The way in which these become obscu-	0
rations to correct application has [already] been described. Obscuration to the	0
[instrumental] causes refers to [the obscuration] to virtue etc. and is	1
due to the influence of the tenfold causal categories317; because it acts as an	1
obscuration by causing obstruction318 to the cause of virtue etc., it is described as an	1
obscuration to the [instrumental] causes. Obscuration to the entry to reality	1
refers to [the obscuration] to the factors that contribute to enlight-	1
enment 319; for [the bodhisattva] enters reality by means of these. Obscuration to	1
supreme virtue refers to [the obscuration] to the perfections320; because	1
there is no virtue superior to this. Obscuration to the special state of	1
excellence of the latter refers to [the obscuration] to the spiritual levels;	1
because only the perfections which form the basis of supramundane excellence are	1
described as the spiritual levels. The complete collection of obscurations	1
refer to the two types in total; i.e. obscuration that consists in moral defilement	1
and obscuration that consists in the knowable because all obscurations are included in	1
these two.	1
The statements of summary meaning are for the purpose of ease in comprehension	1
and retention since [a treatise] which has been summarized is comprehended and	1
retained with ease.	1

Reality	1
With reference to reality, he says:	1
III.1 abcd	1
III.2 abcd	1
Introductory	1
[Sthiramati]	0
There is: (a) basic reality, (b) the	1
reality of characteristic, (c) that	1
characterized by the absence of erro-	0
neous inversion, (d) the reality that	1
consists cause and result and (e)	1
that of the gross and the subtle;	0
(f) Well-established reality, (g) the	0
reality of the sphere of purity, (h)	1
the reality of the aggregation, (i) that	1
which is characterized by differen-	1
tiation and (j) the tenfold reality of	1
the skills which [act] in opposition	1
to the false view of self.	1
There are ten kinds of reality, namely, (a) the basic reality, (b) the	1
reality of characteristic, (c) the reality free from erroneous inversion,	1
(d) the reality of cause and result, (e) the reality of the gross and the	1
subtle, (f) well-established reality, (g) the reality of the sphere of	1
purity, (h) the reality of the aggregation, (i) the reality of differentiation	1
and (j) the reality of the skills. Moreover, the latter [which act] as the	1
counteragents to the ten kinds of self-grasping should be understood as	1
being tenfold, namely, skill in the aggregates, skill in the elements, skill	1
in the sense-fields, skill in dependent origination, skill in the possible	1
and the impossible, skill in the sense faculties, skill in the times, skill	1
in the [four] truths, skill in the vehicles and skill in the conditioned and	1
the unconditioned.	1
[1] Immediately following the explanation of the obscurations is the appropriate place	1
for the explanation of reality since it was listed immediately after [the obscurations].	1
Hence [Vasubandhu] says: with reference to reality, [Maitreyal says... There	1
are various kinds of reality, consequently, without an understanding of their differen-Y111	1
tiation the essential nature of the realities is difficult to understand. Hence, in order to	1
clearly illustrate the differentiation of the realities at the beginning, he says:	1
III.1 a	0
There is: (a) basic reality, (b) the	1
reality of characteristic etc.	1
[2] [Some say] the statement about the basic reality is for the sake of showing	1
that the other realities are included there within the basic reality. The statement about	1
the reality of characteristic is for the sake of overcoming the faults that have	1
entered into clear comprehension, relinquishment and realization in regard to basic	1
reality. The statement about the reality free from erroneous inversion is for	1
the sake of demonstrating the expedients for withdrawal from samsāra. The statement	1
about the reality of cause and result is for the sake of showing the 'going forth'	1
by means of the śrävaka vehicle for one who has become weary [of samsāra] because	0
the śrävaka goes forth by virtue of his penetration of the four noble truths and (his	1
progress in] meditative development. The statement about the reality of the gross	1
is for the sake of showing the expedients for the accomplishment of knowledge of all	0
aspects. The statement about the reality of the subtle is for the sake of showing	1
the expedients for the relinquishment of all obscuration. The statement about well-	1
established reality is: (a) for the sake of showing the expedients which facilitate the	1
explanation of the extremely well-defined³ Dharma and (b) for the sake of showing the	1
expedients for the refutation of all counter-arguments. The statement about the real-	1
ity of the sphere of purity is for the sake of showing the differences in purity	1
according to its differentiation with regard to spiritual lineage, sense faculty and mental	1
disposition, although equal [i.e. non-differentiated] with regard to the dharmadhātu.	1
The statement about the reality of aggregation is for the sake of showing the	1
expedients for entry into defilement and purity in all aspects. The statement about the	1
reality of differentiation is for the purpose of showing the capacity for reversal of	1
all uncertainty, beginning with funcertainty in regard to] thusness. The statement about	1
the reality of the skills is for the sake of showing the expedients for the estab-	1
lishment of non-substantiality after having checked self-grasping, in all its modes.	1
In detail, there are ten kinds of reality.	1
[3] However, others say that the basic reality, which is pertinent to bodhisattvas, is not	1
common [to the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas]. The second reality is the counteragent	1

to incorrect application only in respect to the former [i.e. the bodhisattvas]. The third	0
reality is conformable to correct application. The fourth reality is common to both	1
śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. The fifth reality is an expedient for accomplishment.	1
The sixth reality is common to people in general. The seventh reality is not common to	1
the latter. The eighth reality consists in the totality of the knowable. The ninth reality	1
refers to intrinsic nature. The tenth reality refers to the eradication of the root of	1
defilement.	1
[4] In brief, these ten realities are the basis of all the statements of the tathāgatas with	1
hidden meaning. In detail, reality is immeasurable. Some believe that because it is	1
conformable with reality the conventional too is described as a reality in this context.	1
Others believe that these are all realities because they are not disconsonant with the	1
modes as described, considering that, that which is not disconsonant with a particular	1
mode, is a reality as such.	1
In the above, the basic reality refers to:	1
III.3 a	0
The three natures;	1
[Namely], the imaginary, the other-dependent and the perfected,	0
because the other realities are respectively determined in relation to	1
these. Why is reality considered in relation to the three natures?	1

1. The Basic Reality	1
(a) That which is eternally	1
existent, (b) that which exists but not	1
as a reality and (c) that which both	1
exists and does not exist as a reality;	1
these are thus considered [as the	1
realities] in relation to the three	1
natures.	1
(a) Since that which is characterized as the imaginary is eternally	1
non-existent, it is a reality in relation to the imaginary nature because it	1
is not erroneously inverted. (b) Since that which is characterized as the	1
other-dependent exists, but not as a reality because it consists in error,	1

Y111.19 [1] In the above, the basic reality refers to:	1
III.3 a	1
The three natures etc.	1
Since these have not been established, he says: the imaginary, the other-	1
dependent and the perfected. In order to demonstrate the reason why the three	1
natures are described as comprising the basic reality, he says: because the other	1
realities are respectively determined in relation to these. What is meant is:	1
the other realities, such as that of characteristic, are included within that [basic reality).	1
[2] Why should these three natures be studied? Some believe that it is in order to	1
demonstrate: (a) conventional usage, (b) the absolute and (c) the basis of the latter.	1
Others believe it is in order to demonstrate: (a) erroneous inversion, (b) the cause of	1
that and (c) the objective support that acts as the counteragent to these. Others believe	1
it is in order to demonstrate the foundation of: (a) relinquishment, (b) clear comprehen-	1
sion and (c) realization so as to facilitate separation from obscurations on the part of the	1
bodhisattva. Others believe that it is for the sake of the error-free understanding of the	1
nature of the perfection of wisdom, which is profound by nature, by way of the three	1
natures. For it is stated as follows in two verses from the Abhidharmasūtra 10:	1
it is a reality in relation to the other-dependent nature. (c) Since that	1
which is characterized as the perfected both exists and does not exist as	1
a reality, it is a reality in relation to the perfected nature.	1
Teachings about magical creations and the	1
like are in relation to the world¹1; teachings	1
about non-existence are in relation to the	1
imaginary; however, teachings about the	1
perfected pertain to the four kinds of purity	0
these are: intrinsic purity, immaculate	1
purity, the purity of the objective support	1
and the purity of the path, for, the pure	1
dharmas are incorporated in these four.	1
[The teachings from the Sutras about magical creations etc. are in relation to the	1
world¹2, i.e. the other-dependent nature, because, like a magical creation etc., it is a	1
false appearance. The teachings about non-existence are in relation to what does not	1
exist, i.e. the imaginary nature. The teachings about the perfected are in relation to the	1

fourfold purities. In regard to the fourfold purities: (a) intrinsic purity refers to	0
'thusness' etc. [intrinsic to] the stained state, (b) immaculate purity refers to the latter in	1
the stainless state (c) the purity of the path, which consists in the attainment [of the	1
understanding] of emptiness etc., refers to the factors that contribute to enlightenment	1
etc., (d) the purity of the objective support for the generation of the path refers to the	1
Dharma teachings, such as the Sutras, which flow out of the dharmadhatu because the	1
origination of the path is dependent upon these. Thus the abridged meaning of these	1
two verses is that all pure dharmas are included in these four purities.] Others	1
believe that the natures are admitted as threefold¹* in order to demonstrate that they are	1
the respective objects of mundane, supramundane and the direct intuition attained	1
subsequently to the latter ¹5,	1
[3] Why is reality considered in relation to the three natures? For 'reality'	1
has the sense of being 'not erroneously inverted', thus what is intended by this	1
"question: ""why reality considered in relation to the three natures?"", is: why is that"	1
which is not erroneously inverted considered in relation to the three natures?	1
III.3 ab	1
The three natures [refer to]: (a) that	1
which is eternally non-existent¹6 etc.	1
That which is characterized as the imaginary is eternally non-existent.	1
That [object] in regard to which naive people have notional attachment to the appre-	1
hended object and apprehending subject and also to the signified and signifier, like in a	1
dream, has¹7 an imaginary nature because its essential nature does not exist. Hence¹8,	1
since it has both the nature of a non-ens and is without error, that which is character-	1
ized by the imaginary does not exist. Consequently, only non-existence is described as	1
the reality in relation to the imaginary nature because it is not erroneously	1
inverted. Here he shows the meaning of reality as 'not erroneously inverted'.	1
This section in parenthesis which comments on the two verses from the Abhidharma-sūtra is	1

[4] That which is characterized as the other-dependent exists but not as	1
a reality ¹9. That which is characterized by the imaginary, i.e. the apprehended object	1
and apprehending subject etc., does exist since it is the basis of conventional	1
[linguistic] usage. However, because it does not exist in its nature as apprehended	1
object and apprehending subject etc. it does not exist as a reality as such. In order to	1
clearly illustrate this, he says: because it consists in 'bare' error. This is what is	1
being said: that which appears 20, like the material cause of a magical creation, does	1
exist; the way in which it appears, like a magically created man etc., i.e. in the aspect of	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject, does not exist as such hence it is	1
[described as] error. It is a reality in relation to the other-dependent	1
nature21. That which exists in a different way is manifested in the aspect of some-	1
thing non-existent in relation to itself. That it is because it is not erroneously inverted	1
is understood here also because this is the subject under discussion.	1
[5] That which is characterized as the perfected both exists and does not	1
exist as a reality 22. That which is characterized by the perfected is a reality that	1
both exists and does not exist. It exists because it has the nature of the existence of the	1
non-existence of the duality; and it does not exist because it has the nature of the non-	1
existence of the duality. It is a reality because it is the objective support for purity. It	1
is a reality in relation to the perfected nature; it is the fact that this is because	1
it is not erroneously inverted that is referred to.	1

[1] Since the reality of the three natures has been described but its characteristic has	1
not, or else, since the reality of characteristic was [initially] mentioned immediately	1
following basic reality and it has not been established, he asks: what is the reality	1
of characteristic? Hence he says:	1

Views that consist in imputation and	1
negation in regard to: (a) the	1
dharmas and the personal entity etc.	1
Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to the personal	1
entity and the dharmas do not arise due to the knowledge of this 24 the	1
reality-characteristic in relation to the imaginary nature. Views that con-	0
sist in imputation refer to the notional attachment to the self and to the dharmas of form	1
etc. as existing25 in an absolute sense and which, being separate26 from consciousness	0
in the appearance of these, form its objective supports. The view that consists in nega-	1
tion refers to the notion that they [i.e. self and dharmas etc.] do not exist even by way	1
of conventional [linguistic] usage. Others say that the view that consists in negation is	1
that which rejects consciousness as an appearance of the personal entity and the	1
dharmas; this should be thought of as the rejection of the apprehending subject27.	1
Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to the personal entity and the	1
dharmas do not arise due to the discrimination of a particular characteristic [this is]	1
the reality-characteristic in relation to the imaginary nature which should be understood	1
as being devoid of imputation and negation is that characteristic. And this is a reality	1
as conventional usage but not by way of own-being because the views that consists in	1

and apprehending subject do not arise due to the knowledge of this the	1
reality-characteristic in relation to the other-dependent nature. Views	0
that consist in imputation and negation in regard to existent and non-	1
existent [entities] do not arise due to the knowledge of this the reality-	1
characteristic in relation to the perfected nature. This non-erroneously	1
inverted (reality-) characteristic23 in relation to the basic reality is	1
described as the reality of characteristic.	1

[2] Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to the	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject...; the erroneous appearance of	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject is [respectively] grasped as dharma and	1
personal entity if one is notionally attached to their existence as a reality - the impu-	1
tation in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject occurs in this way.	1
Now if one is notionally attached to the non-existence of both the apprehending subject	1
and apprehended object alike, then the negation in regard to the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject [occurs]28. Views that consist in imputation and nega-	1
tion in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject do	1
not arise due to the knowledge of this characteristic, the reality-character-	1
istic in relation to the other-dependent nature which should be known as	1
devoid of imputation and negation. Furthermore, the latter does not exist insofar as its	1
nature as apprehended object and apprehending subject imaginatively constructed 29,	1

Due to clear comprehension thus, the views that consist in imputation and negation do	1
not arise in regard to the other-dependent.	1
[3] Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to non-	1
existent [entities] ³0...; certain people say that if one perceives emptiness as some-	1
thing existent, then this is [equivalent to] the view that imputes existence. Conversely,	1
if [one perceives emptiness] as something non-existent, then this is [equivalent to] the	1
view that it is not an existent. Moreover, both of these views in regard existent and	1
non-existent [entities] do not arise due to the knowledge of this character-	1
istic³1 the reality-characteristic in relation to the perfected nature. Some	1
believe that³2 this [i.e. the reality-characteristic] is, in its own-being, free from both	1
existence and non-existence because views abour existence and non-existence in regard	1
to the perfected nature do not arise as the consequence of its knowledge. Others again	1
say that the notion the. the emptiness of essential nature is [equivalent to] the non-	1
existence of the duality33 is [to succumb to] the extreme of the imputation of exis-	1

tence34 because there is the imputation of an existent essential nature to that which in	1
its nature is free from both existence and non-existence. Conversely, the notion that	1
this [i.e. the non-existence of the duality] does not exist by way of an essential nature	1
consisting in the non-existence of the duality which is free from both existence and	1
non-existence and is the sphere of direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation³5	1
is [to succumb to] the extreme of the negation of non-existence. Others 36 believe that	1
both of these explanations should be reflected upon because of the intimate connection,	1
individually, of existence and non-existence with the views that consist in imputation	1
and negation. In this context, existence refers to the existence of the non-existence of	1
the duality. If one grasps the latter as a definite ens, then existence is imputed. If one	1
grasps it as a definite non-ens, then it is negated. Moreover, non-existence refers to the	1
non-existence of the duality. If one grasps this in terms of annihilation, then non-exis-	1
tence is imputed as an absolute non-existence. Now if one grasps it just by way of the	1
duality, then there is negation because it is manifested as a non-existent duality. Alter-	1
natively, if one grasps it as having an existent essential nature, then there is imputation.	1
Conversely, if one grasps it purely as a non-ens, then defilement and purification are	1
negated. This avoidance of the two extremes³7 is [equivalent to] the reality character-	1
istic in relation to the perfected nature. [Objection]: Is it not so that the characteristic of	1

For the three natures consist in basic reality. In relation to these	1
[three] respectively, there are three kinds of impermanent object: (a) the	1
object as non-existent, (b) the object as coming into being and passing	1
away and (c) the object as stained and stainless41.	1
III.6 cd	1
An impermanent object is: (a) a non-	1
existent object, (b) characterized by	1
coming into being and passing away;	0
and (c) stained and stainless, respec-	1
tively, in relation to basic reality.	1
In relation to [the threefold] basic reality, respectively42. Suffering	1
is: (a) due to appropriating, i.e. due to the appropriating of notional	1
attachment to the personal entity and the dharmas, (b) due to the char-	1
acteristic, i.e. due to the characteristic of the threefold nature of	1
suffering and (c) due to association, i.e. due to the association with	1
suffering. Thus should [suffering] be understood43 in relation to that	1
[threefold] basic reality, respectively.	1
III.7 ab	1
Suffering is stated as being due to:	1
(a) appropriating, (b) the character-	1

Since the imaginary characteristic does not exist in any mode what-	1
soever the very non-existence is its emptiness. Since the other-depen-	1
dent characteristic does not exist in the manner in which it is imagined	1
but is not non-existent in every respect, its existence as something other	1
is emptiness. Since the perfected characteristic has emptiness for its	1
own-being its very intrinsic nature is emptiness.	1
III.7 cd	1
Since the very characteristic of the imaginary nature does not exist	1
the very absence of characteristic is its insubstantiality. Since the char-	1
acteristic of the other-dependent does exit, but not in the manner in	1
which it is imagined, the characteristic which is a characteristic differ-	1
ent from that [which is imagined] is its insubstantiality. However,	1
since the perfected nature consists in insubstantiality, the individual	1
characteristic44 itself is its insubstantiality.	1
The three kinds of impermanence have now been revealed in relation	1
to the threefold basic reality as the impermanence of: (a) a non-existing	1
object, (b) the impermanence of what comes into being and passes away	1
and (c) the impermanence of what is stained and stainless.	1
The nature of suffering is threefold: (a) suffering due to appropri-	1
ating, (b) suffering due to the characteristic and (c) suffering due to	1
association. Emptiness is threefold: (a) the emptiness of what is non-	0
existent, (b) the emptiness of what exists as something other and (c) the	1
emptiness of own-being. Insubstantiality is threefold: (a) insubstan-	1
tiality as the absence of characteristic, (b) insubstantiality as a different	1
characteristic and (c) insubstantiality as the individual characteristic.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Insubstantiality is explained as: (a)	1
the absence of characteristic, (b) the	1
difference of characteristic from that	1
[which is imagined] and (c) the indi-	1
vidual characteristic.	1
Y116.15 [1] Immediately following the reality of characteristic45, the reality free from erro-	1
neous inversion should be stated because the latter was listed immediately after the	1
former; hence he says: the reality free from erroneous inversion. For the	1
permanent, the painful, the empty and the insubstantial46 are described as	0

Read: -anatmata in place of -anâtmano, cf. Bhäşya N38.22.+12	1
the reality free from erroneous inversion because they [act as] counteragents 47	0
to the erroneous inversion of permanence, pleasure, purity and the substan-	1
tiality. Previously, the inclusion of the other realities within the basic reality was	1
asserted, hence he asks: how do the latter relate to basic reality? As the	1
impermanence [of what is impermanent] etc48. The impermanent etc. refers	0
to the modes of the impermanent, the painful, the empty and the insubstantial the state	1
(-tā of anitya-tā) of that is impermanence etc. In order to demonstrate that the reality	1
free from erroneous inversion is included within the basic reality, he says:	1
An impermanent object is: (a) a non-	0
existent object etc.	1
For there are three kinds of impermanent object: (a) the object as	1
existent, (b) the object as coming into being and passing away and (c)	1
the object as stained and stainless; that which exists eternally as such is perman-	1
ent; the inverse of this is impermanent; ...in relation to these [three], respec-	1
tively. With regard to these: (a) the imaginary nature is impermanent in the sense of	1
the impermanence of something eternally non-existent; others believe that this is to be	1
understood according to the rules of grammatical analysis, i.e. the impermanent (anitya)	1
is always non-existent (asannitya). (b) The other-dependent nature is impermanent in	1
the sense of impermanence characterized by coming into being and passing away every	1
moment, because it arises from causal conditions, and because there is no causality	1
when it passes away. (c) The perfected nature is impermanent in the sense of adven-	1
titious impermanence 49 which is characterized by both the possession of stain and	1
stainlessness, although it consists in a dharma50 that does not change.	1
III.5 c	1
Suffering is stated as being due to:	1
(a) appropriating, (b) the charac-	1
teristic etc.	1
Suffering51 is threefold: (a) the suffering due to appropriating, (b) the suffering due to	1
the characteristic and (c) the suffering due to association. Of these, the imaginary	1
nature consists in suffering that is (a) due to appropriating. There is suffering	1
since suffering is appropriated (upādīyate) either in the present life or in other lives on	1
account of the absence of clear comprehension. And in order to demonstrate the	1
manner in which suffering is appropriated on account of this absence of clear compre-	1

hension, he says: due to the appropriating of notional attachment to the	0
personal entity and the dharmas. There is the notional attachment to the	1
personal entity and the dharmas since one becomes notionally attached to the personal	1
entity and the dharmas through 'grasping' an entity on account of this [absence of clear	1
comprehension]. This [appropriating] belongs to the imaginary nature because it has	1
'fallen' into duality. It is described in this way because the continuation of suffering is	1
due to the notional attachment to the imaginary nature52. The imaginary itself is not	1
suffering because it does not exist53. Alternatively, since the imaginary nature is	1
appropriated in the nature of an entity on account of the notional attachment to the	1
personal entity and the dharmas, thus the imaginary nature consists in the suffering that	1
is due to grasping.	1
[4] The other-dependent nature is referred to as the suffering that is (b) due to the	1
characteristic. For the threefold nature of suffering refers to the suffering of	1
suffering, the suffering of change and the suffering of the formative forces. Moreover,	1
since these three sufferings are the sufferings that pertain to the other-dependent54,	1
they are [described as] the suffering that is due to the characteristic.	1
[5] The perfected nature consists in suffering that is: (c) due to association. The	1
"word ""and"" has a conjunctive sense. How is it due to association? He says: due to"	1
the association with suffering. The other-dependent nature consists in suffer-	1
ing; the real nature of the latter is described as suffering because even though perfected	1
it is also associated with suffering. [Thus should suffering be understood] in	1
relation to that [threefold] basic reality, respectively. In this regard, the	1
suffering that is on account of grasping consists in the imaginary. [The suffering] that	1
is on account of the characteristic consists in the other-dependent. [The suffering] that	1
is on account of association consists in the perfected.	1
Emptiness is threefold: (a) emptiness as non-existence, (b) emptiness as an existence as	1
something other and (c) emptiness as intrinsic nature. Therein, emptiness as non-exis-	1
tence pertains to the imaginary nature. In order to clearly illustrate just this55, he says:	1
since the imaginary characteristic, like the essential nature of horns on a hare	1

Emptiness is considered as: (a) non-	1
existence, (b) existence as something	1
other and (c) intrinsic nature;	0

etc., does not exist as the existing apprehended object in any mode whatsoever	1
through direct perception or inference; the very non-existence is its empti-	1
ness56. The emptiness of what exists as something other pertains to the other-depen-	1
dent [nature]. In order to clearly illustrate just this, he says: since the other-depen-	1
dent characteristic does not exist in the manner in which it is imagined	1
by naive people, i.e. in the nature of the duality, but is not non-existent in every	1
respect. Moreover, the mode in which it does exist is understood through mundane	1
direct intuition that is pure; therefore its existence as something other is empti-	1
ness 57. The emptiness as intrinsic nature pertains to the perfected [nature], hence he	1
says: since the perfected characteristic has emptiness for its own-being;	1
because it has the non-existence of the duality for its own-being; therefore, its very	1
intrinsic nature is emptiness, i.e. its very own-being.	1
III.7 c	1
Insubstantiality is threefold: (a) insubstantiality as the absence of characteristic, (b)	1
insubstantiality as a difference of characteristic59 and (c) insubstantiality as the individ-	1
ual characteristic. Of these, the absence of characteristic itself is an insubstantiality	1
because there is the absence of the characteristic of a nature that is imaginary. This is	1
why he says: since the very characteristic of the imaginary nature does not	1
exist, the very absence of characteristic is its insubstantiality 60, i.e. he	1
shows that it does not exist in any other mode. Insubstantiality as a difference in char-	1
acteristic pertains to the other-dependent, because, the characteristic of the other-	1
dependent does exist, in the nature of an entity, but not in the way in which	1
it is imagined by naive people, i.e. as the duality; the other-dependent character-	1
istic which is a characteristic different from that, i.e. dissimilar to the	1
imagined characteristic is its insubstantiality. Thus, its insubstantiality is shown	1
to be an imaginary substantiality61. Insubstantiality as the individual characteristic62 is	1
pertinent to the perfected since the perfected nature consists in insubstantial-	1
ity because it has the non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
Insubstantiality is explained as: (a)	0
the absence of characteristic58 etc.	0

subject as its nature; hence by saying: the individual characteristic itself is its	0
insubstantiality, he shows that the perfected dharma has insubstantiality for its	1
own-being63	1
[8] Just what difference is there between these two terms, i.e. emptiness and insub-	1
stantiality? Some believe that wherein something does not exist, the former is empty of	1
the latter; however, if something is not the substance (ātman), i.e. the own-being of	1
something else, on account of this, the latter is insubstantial (anãtman) - this is the	1
difference between the two. Others again believe that although there is no difference in	1
reality, there is a difference according to the way in which they are respectively deter-	1
mined, since that wherein something does not exist is insubstantial because of the	1
absence of own-being on its part, however, in the former case, its emptiness is on	1
account of the absence of the perfected nature within it.	1
[9] In order to demonstrate that they [act as] the counteragents to the extremes of	1
imputation and negation and also that they consist in adventitious stain the three	1
kinds of impermanence have now been respectively revealed64 in relation	1
to the threefold basic reality as: (a) the impermanence of a non-existing	1
object, (b) the impermanence of what comes into being and passes away	1
and (c) the impermanence of what is stained and stainless. The reality free	1
from erroneous inversion65 is described in this way, concluding with the statement:	1
insubstantiality is threefold.	0
4. The Reality of Cause and Result.	1
The reality consisting in cause and result is [equivalent to the	1
[noble] truth of suffering, its origination, its cessation and the path [to	1
the latter] in relation to that same basic reality. How does the threefold	1
basic reality consist in the [four] truths beginning with suffering?	1
Because the latter are characterized by impermanence etc.	1
III.8 b	1
Hence it is considered as the truth of	1
suffering;	1
The truth of origination [is considered] through the threefold cate-	0
gories of origination. The threefold categories of origination are:	1

(a) latent impression, (b) manifes-	1

Origination as latent impression refers to the latent impressions of	1
the notional attachment to the imaginary nature. Origination as mani-	1
festation refers to karma and moral defilement. Origination as non-sep-	1
aration refers to the non-separation of thusness from obscuration.	1
The truth of cessation [is considered] through the three kinds of	1
cessation. The three kinds of cessation are:	1
III.9 ab	1
III.8 cd	1
Considered as: (a) non-origination	1
by way of own-being, (b) non-origi-	1
nation by way of the duality and (c)	1
the two extinctions of stain;	0
Non-origination by way of own-being, non-origination by way of	0
the apprehended object and apprehending subject and the two extinc-	1
tions of stain are stated as cessation through critical consideration and	1
also as thusness. These are the three kinds of cessation, namely,	1
cessation by way of own-being, cessation by way of the duality and	1
cessation by way of intrinsic nature.	1
How is the truth of the path respectively determined in relation to	1
the threefold basic reality?	1
III.9 cd & 10 a	1
In relation to their: (a) clear compre-	1
hension, (b) renunciation and (c)	1
realization as attainment; this is	1
stated as the truth of the path.	1
I.e. in relation to: (a) the clear comprehension of the imaginary [nature],	1
(b) the clear comprehension and renunciation of the other-dependent	1
[nature] and (c) the clear comprehension of the perfected [nature] and	1
its realization as attainment. Thus it should be understood that the	1
establishment of the truth of the path in this regard is in relation to	1
clear comprehension, renunciation and realization.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Since the reality of cause and result should be discussed immediately after the	1
latter [i.e. the reality free from erroneous inversion], he says: the reality consisting	1
in cause and result ...in relation to that same basic reality 66. Therein,	1
concerning the side of defilement, the truth of suffering is [equivalent to] the reality of	1
Read: phalahetumayan tattvam tatraiva malatattve in place of milatattve phalahetutattvam;	0
cf. Bhäşya N40.5.Y121	1
the result; the truth of origination is [equivalent to the reality of the cause. Moreover,	0
concerning the side of purification, the truth of cessation is [equivalent to] the reality of	1
the result and the truth of the path is [equivalent to] the reality of the cause. In this way	1
the four truths, beginning with suffering, are [equivalent to] the reality of cause and	1
result. It has been said that [this reality] is [equivalent to the truth67 of	1
suffering, its origination, its cessation and the path [to the latter] in rela-	1
tion to that same basic reality68.	1
[2] And since it is not discerned how basic reality pertains to the own-being of the	1
truth of suffering etc. he asks: how does the threefold basic reality consist in	1
the [four] truths beginning with suffering? Hence he says: because the	1
latter are characterized69 by impermanence etc.	1
III.8 b	1
Hence 70 it is considered as the truth	1
of suffering;	1
In detail, it is said that the impermanent, the painful, the empty and the insubstantial are	0
the characteristics of the truth of suffering and, as a totality, these exist individually in	1
the imaginary etc. Hence, the imaginary etc. are intended, individually, as the truth of	1
suffering.	1
[3] The truth of origination [is considered] as the threefold basic reality,	1
respectively, through the threefold categories of origination. Since their	1
origination is not understood, he says: the threefold categories of origination	1
III.8 cd	0
The three kinds of origination are: (a) origination as latent impression, (b) origination	1
as manifestation and (c) origination as non-separation. Of these, the origination as	1
latent impression should be understood as the imaginary nature; hence he says:	0
...refers to the latent impressions of the notional attachment to the	1
imaginary nature. Since, although the imaginary nature does not exist, the dharmas	1
that consist in the mundane respectively determine the latent impressions of both con-	1
ceptual differentiation and moral defilement72 on account of notional attachment to its	1
existence; however, the [dharmas that consist in the] supramundane and which are	1
without notional attachment, do not. Consequently, the imaginary nature is described	1
as origination as latent impression. Origination as manifestation should be	1
(a) latent impression, (b) manifes-	1
tation and (c) non-separation.	1

understood as the other-dependent [nature]73; manifestation refers to the acquisition of	0
a substantial nature. That which comes into being from something else is [described	1
"as] ""origination as manifestation"", because it originates from this. Furthermore, as to"	1
its essential nature, he says: ...refers to karma and moral defilement and these	1
two consist in the other-dependent nature because they have the nature of substantial	1
entities. Origination as non-separation refers to [the non-separation] of	1
thusness74; how so? Hence he says: [its] non-separation from obscuration.	1
"This is what is being said: [thusness] receives the title ""origination"" since: (a) suffering"	1
originates as long as thusness is not separate from obscuration, or (b) thusness which	1
is not separate from obscuration -	1
is the real nature of origination.	0
[4] The truth of cessation which consists in basic reality [is considered]	1
through the three kinds of cessation and since these are not discerned, he says:	1
the three kinds of cessation are:	1
III.9 ab	0
Considered as: (a) non-origination	1
by way of own-being, (b) non-origi-	1
nation by way of the duality and (c)	1
the two extinctions of stain;	0
Therein, non-origination by way of own-being refers to the imaginary [nature]	0
since it is an absolute non-origination because it is devoid of own-being, like the son of	1
a barren woman. Non-origination by way of the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject refers to the other-dependent; moreover, since this is absol-	1
utely devoid of the essential nature 75 of an apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject, it is non-origination by way of a nature that consists in an erroneous duality.	1
"And the two extinctions of stain refer to the perfected; the word ""and"" has the"	1
conjunctive sense. But since these [extinctions] are not discerned, he says: ...are	1
stated as cessation through critical consideration and also as thusness76.	1
Stain is twofold: (a) obscuration such as passion and (b) the imaginary. Therein, when	1
the 'seed' has been extracted from its basis through direct intuition that is without impu-	1
rity, an extinction [is achieved] which consists in the absolute non-origination of the	1
stain of passion etc. this is cessation through critical consideration. By means of	1
direct intuition into the absence of the duality which belongs to the sphere of thusness,	0
an extinction [is achieved] which consists in the non-origination of the stain of the	1
imaginary; this is thusness. Both of these consist in the perfected nature. These three	1

kinds of cessation are to be discerned in relation to basic reality, beginning with the	0
imaginary, according to their respective enumeration. However others believe that the	1
extinction77 of these dual stains consisting in moral defilement and the imaginary are	1
described as thusness on account of the penetration of thusness because of the state-	1
ment: cessation by way of the duality and cessation by way of intrinsic	0
nature. Intrinsic nature refers to thusness because this refers to the intrinsic luminos-	1
ity of mind. Hence, since it has thusness for its objective support, this cessation is	1
described as cessation by way of intrinsic nature, [whereas] cessation alone78 is	1
[described as] cessation through critical consideration. Others believe that cessation is	1
[equivalent to] thusness inasmuch as [suffering] has ceased in the latter79. Further-	1
more, since cessation consists in non-origination, after collecting together all [elements]	0
that have non-origination etc. for their own-being, they are described as the truth of	1
cessation. The inclusion of the truth of cessation within basic reality has now been	1
described.	1
[5] However, since the truth of the path should be included immediately after the latter,	1
he asks: how is the truth of the path respectively determined in relation to	1
the threefold basic reality ?80 Hence the statement beginning with:	1
III.9 c	1
In relation to their: (a) clear compre-	1
hension [(b) renunciation]81 etc.	1
i.e. in relation to: (a) the clear comprehension of the imaginary [nature];	0
since the imaginary nature is absolutely non-existent there is only its clear comprehen-	1
sion and not its renunciation, for the renunciation of what does not exist is not tenable.	1
(b) In relation to the clear comprehension and renunciation of the other-	1
dependent [nature], for the other-dependent is to be understood as not existing in	1
the manner in which it appears but not as non-existent in its whole nature, like the	1
imaginary; also, because karma and moral defilement have the nature of entities82, it	1
[i.e. the other-dependent] is to be renounced. And (c) in relation to the clear	0
comprehension of the perfected [nature] and its realization as attain-	1
ment. For the perfected should be clearly comprehended as being characterized by	1
both the exemption from existence and non-existence and as the turning about of the	1

basis 83. Since the turning about of the basis is to be realized as the liberated Dharma	1
Body, emptiness should be clearly comprehended. Cessation should be realized	0
through the realization as attainment. Others believe that there are two aspects to both	1
[clear comprehension and realization] because clear comprehension is twofold: (a) clear	1
comprehension as knowledge and (b) clear comprehension as renunciation84. Therein,	1
the first and the third [natures] are to be clearly comprehended through clear compre-	1
hension as knowledge but the second [nature] should be clearly comprehended as both.	1
Realization also is twofold: (a) realization as knowledge and (b) realization as attain-	1
ment. Therein, although all three [natures] are to be realized through realization as	1
knowledge only the third is [to be realized] through realization as attainment. Thus it	1
should be understood that the establishment of the truth of the path in	1
this, i.e. within basic reality, is in relation to clear comprehension, renunci-	1
ation and realization85; but not because it is included therein [i.e. within basic real-	1
ity]. In this [section] the following are revealed through the four truths: (a) defilement,	1
(b) that from which it originates, (c) the purification of these two and (d) that from	1
which this originates. However, their sequential order is in accordance with one's	1
intuitive understanding.	1

The absolute truth is to be understood as being due to the one, i.e.	1
due only to the perfected nature. But how can that be absolute?	1
III.11 ab	1
Because the absolute is considered as	1
threefold, i.e. by way of: (a) object,	1
(b) attainment and (c) spiritual prac-	1
tice;	1
(a) The absolute as object is thusness, considering that it is the	1
object of the highest direct intuition. (b) The absolute as attainment is	1
nirvana, considering that it is the highest object. (c) The absolute as	1
spiritual practice is the path, considering that the highest is its object.	1
How can both the unconditioned and the conditioned be described as	1
the perfected nature?	1
III.11 cd	1
The two [are considered] by way of	1
perfection that is unchanging and	0
free from erroneous inversion.	1
The unconditioned is perfected insofar as it is [equivalent to]	1
unchanging perfection. The conditioned, which is incorporated in the	1
truth86 of the path, [is perfected] insofar as it is [equivalent to]	1
perfection free from erroneous inversions because of the absence of	1
erroneous inversion in regard to the entity that is the object of	1
knowledge.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y123.9 [1] The reality of the gross and the subtle87; gross reality refers to conven-	1
tional truth; subtle reality refers to absolute truth. Since, at the beginning, [the	1
bodhisattva] brings beings to maturity by means of the gross but liberates those who	1
have reached maturity by means of the subtle, the gross is [explained] prior to the	1
subtle which follows. This statement is contradictory to the congruity of a verse [i.e.	1
III.1d]. Therein conventional truth refers to gross reality because it is the domain of	1
non-concentrated knowledge; absolute truth refers to subtle reality because it is the	1
domain of concentrated knowledge. Alternatively, [the former] refers to the gross	1
because it is the domain of consciousness and [the latter] refers to the subtle because it	1
is the domain of direct intuition. Since it has been asserted that all the realities are	1
intended as being included within basic reality, he asks: how should this be	1
understood in relation to basic reality? Hence he says:	1
satya is omitted from the Tib. (cf.D12b.2).	0

In relation to the sic reality, the gross reality is to be understood by way of designa-	1
tion, knowledge and utterance 89. In order to clearly illustrate just this, he says: for the	1
conventional is threefold. Respectively determining the form of a non-existing	0
object, i.e. calling it a water-pitcher or a cloth90 is (a) the conventional as desig-	1
nation. Others believe that the conventional as designation refers to the articulation	0
by way of the name as distinct from the essential nature of form, sensation and con-	1
ceptualization etc. Others believe that the conventional as designation is that which is	1
conventionally expressed as form or sensation, depending upon verbal articulation. It	1
is the imaginary nature because, like mind and the mental concomitants91, it is non-	1
existent.	1
[3] (b) The conventional as knowledge. The conventional as knowledge refers	1
to that92 conceptual differentiation on account of which one becomes notionally	1
attached to forms etc. and water pitchers etc.93 in accordance with their respective	1
determination as having the nature of entities as if they were external realities, although	1
they are not external to the appearances in consciousness.	1
"[4] And (c) the conventional as utterance. The word ""and"" has a conjunctive"	0
sense. The conventional as utterance refers to the demonstration of the perfected	1
[nature] through its synonyms such as emptiness, thusness, the possession of stain and	1
stainlessness etc. 94, although it transcends conceptual differentiation and verbal	1
description.	1

[linguistic] usage through verbal expression alone in the absence of an object; there-	0
fore, the conventional truth is imaginary since it consists in the conventional as desig-	1
"nation because the object does not exist. ""Knowledge"" refers to the notional attach-"	1
ment to an object although it does not exist. The conventional usage that results from	1
that [knowledge] is the conventional as knowledge; furthermore, this refers to the	1
conceptual differentiation that pertains to notional attachment. Therefore, the conven-	1
tional truth consists in the other-dependent as it consists in the conventional by way of	1
"knowledge. ""Utterance"" is that which [provides] a clear indication of the dharmadhātu"	1
- which is inexpressible through words such as 'thusness'. The conventional usage in	1
regard to the dharmadhātu by means of that [utterance] is the conventional as utterance.	1
Hence, conventional truth consists in the perfected [nature] since it consists in the	1
conventional as utterance. Of these, the conventional as designation and utterance	0
should be understood as respective determinations [that occur] as comprised by the	1
circumstances but not in terms of own-being. Conventional truth has now been	1
described.	1
[6] Now the absolute truth should be mentioned, hence he says:	1
III.10 d	0
However, the absolute [should be	1
understood] by way of the one.	1
For it is impossible that the absolute can belong to the imaginary and other-dependent	1
[natures]; however, absolute truth is to be understood as being due to the	1
one, i.e. due to just the perfected nature 95. But, for what reason is that per-	1
fected [nature] described 96 as absolute? Hence he says:	1
III.11 ab	1
Because the absolute is considered as	1
threefold, i.e. by way of: (a) object,	1
(b) attainment and (c) spiritual prac-	1
tice 97;	1
For the absolute is threefold: (a) the absolute as object, (b) the absolute as attainment	0
and (c) the absolute as spiritual practice 98. Of these, (a) the absolute as object is	1
thusness, for the supramundane direct intuition is highest; thusness is described as	1
the highest object (paramārtha) considering that⁹9 it is the object (artha) or [sense]	1
object (vișaya) of that [direct intuition], just like an object of the sense faculties. In	1
order to demonstrate this, he says: considering that it is the object of the	1
highest direct intuition. What is meant is: because it is determined as being an	1

objective support. [However], since it is not something that is separate from direct	0
intuition, at the time [of being intuited] it does not become an objective support, like the	1
appearances as representation-only; for example, apart from their mere representation	0
as form etc., the appearances as form etc. do not exist for those [objects] for which rep-	1
resentation-only is allowed 100,	1
[8] (b) The absolute as attainment is nirvāpa; thusness which is absolutely	0
devoid of stain is the characteristic of the turning about of the basis. How can this be	1
the absolute? Hence he says: considering that it is the highest objecti01, i.e.	1
considering that it is both an object (artha) and is the highest (parama), it is the highest	1
object (paramārtha). It is the highest in this regard because it is foremost among the	1
unconditioned and conditioned dharmas; it is an object in the sense that it is the aim of	1
the path. For thus, the attainment of nirvana is the aim of the path but nirvāṇa is the	1
object [i.e. the aim] because it is free from all harmful faults since that which is accom-	1
panied by fault is described as a non-object.	1
[9] (c) The absolute as spiritual practice is the path; why is this? Consid-	1
ering that the highest is its object; object (artha) here means [sense]-object	1
(vişaya) or aim (prayojana)102; the object is thusness, the aim is nirvāṇa. [Objection]:	1
If it is described as the highest 103 on account of the object, would there not be a recip-	1
rocal dependence [i.e. the path is highest on account of the object and the object is	1
highest on account of the path]? [Response]: If there is reciprocal dependence 104, what	1
fault is there? [Objection]: there can be no positive determination. [Response]: This	1
will not be so because there is reciprocal dependence as in the case of a lion and a	1
forest 105	1
[10] How can both the unconditioned, namely nirvana, and the condi-	1
tioned, namely the path, be described as the perfected nature?106 For absol-	1
ute truth has been explained as the perfected nature, however, it is not tenable that the	1
path be perfected considering that it has no non-existent previous and subsequent	1
portions. Therefore, the path is not [equivalent to] absolute truth and if it is not per-	1
fected it cannot be included within absolute truth. Hence he says:	1

The two [are considered] by way of	1
perfection that is both unchanging	0
and free from erroneous inversion 107.	1
An alternate [objection]: how can the unconditioned, namely nirvana, and the condi-	1
tioned, namely the path, be described as the perfected nature? For the perfected refers	1
to thusness and since it is devoid of the characteristic of the duality that pertains to the	1
other-dependent, the condition of perfection on the part of both nirvāṇa and the path is	1
not tenable. [Response]: this objection is not tenable108 since the non-existence of the	1
duality therein refers to the perfected, however, it is only the non-existence of the dual-	1
ity that is [referred to as] the perfected, thus what is other than this is not refuted. And	1
hence the two perfected [natures) other than this which comprise the absence of change	1
and the absence of erroneous inversion are also referred to as perfected. The uncondi-	1
tioned refers to nirvāṇa and thusness. The unconditioned is perfected insofar	1
as it is [equivalent to] unchanging perfection because it cannot be otherwise.	1
The conditioned, which is incorporated in the truth of the path and not	1
elsewhere, is perfected insofar as it is [equivalent to] perfection free from	1
erroneous inversion. As to why this is so, he says: because of the absence	1
of erroneous inversion in regard to the entity that is the object of	1
knowledge; i.e. since erroneous inversion never occurs in regard to the object of	1
knowledge. Therefore, the path is also perfected and consequently, due to the differ-	1
ences in intended meaning, [the assertion] that the perfected [nature] pertains to both	1
the conditioned and the unconditioned is not contradictory.	1
6. The Well Established Reality.	1
How is the well established reality respectively determined in rela-	1
tion to basic reality? Well established reality is twofold: (a) that which	1
is generally established and (b) that which is established through	1
reasoning. In this respect:	1

That which is generally established	1

Based upon the three means of valid knowledge, an entity is estab-	1
lished through reasoning which consists in the proof of logical possi-	1
bility by those who are wise, i.e. learned in argumentation, and the	1
dialecticians, [i.e. the examiners]110.	1
It results just from the imaginary [nature]113 because of the impossibility [of its	1
establishment] in accordance with verbal description since it does not result from	1
something other. However, its essential nature is not known, hence he says: in	1
regard to entities etc.; the conventional symbol refers to knowledge which	0
connects the name and the possessor of the name. Familiarity...; this refers to the	1
endeavour and perspective that is repeatedly oriented towards that [conventional	1
symbol]114. Insofar as their intellects enter into the latter two115; just what	1
does this entry into familiarity with conventional symbols by the intellect refer to? It	1
refers to memory. This is what is being said: there is a similarity in the per-	1
spective of all worldlings, i.e. those who know the treatises and those who do	1
not, in regard to things that are conventionally expressed, insofar as their intellect is in	1
conformity with their memory which has familiarity with the conventional symbol.	1

refers to those who are learned in argumentation¹19⁹. The dialecticians refers to the	1
examiners; after thinking about the explanation of the former [i.e. those who are	1
learned in argumentation], the latter term [i.e. dialecticians] is stated ¹20. Alternatively,	1
those who are wise are the seekers for what is wholesome. Those who are learned in	1
argumentation are those whose skill is complete in regard to the non-contradictory	1
meaning of the four types of reasoning which consist in: (a) consideration, (b) cause	1
and effect, (c) [proof of] logical possibility and (d) real nature¹21. The dialecticians are	1
those who have the capacity for conjecture and exclusion and are the authors of the	1
treatises that are free from erroneous inversion for they are based upon the scriptural	1
statements of the tathāgatas. The examiners are learned in their own and other's	1
treatises and are scrutineers of virtues and faults. However, some people do not read	1
"""examiners"", consequently, they query just who these ""wise ones"" are when it is said:"	0
"on the part of those who are wise'. Hence¹22, [Vasubandhu] says: ""those who are"	1
"learned in argumentation"". Moreover, the latter are of two types because they can be"	1
situated on the level of dialectic or on the level of meditative development; therefore,	1
the dialecticians are specified. Since certain of these people are investigators of what is	1
generally established 123, he says: based upon the three means of valid knowl-	1
edge. What is meant is: since there is no contradiction with the three means of valid	1
knowledge ¹24. The three means of valid knowledge are: (a) direct perception, (b)	1
inference and (c) scriptural tradition. Direct perception in this context refers to: (a) the	1

correct, however a suitable Sanskrit reconstruction is difficult to formulate. In any case the	1

that is to be inferred through the three types of [inferential] mark, 126 Scriptural tradi-	1
tion refers to the words of trustworthy people; moreover, trustworthy people are those	1
"who are free from the causes of falsehood. Alternatively, he says: ""based upon the"	1
"three means of valid knowledge"" because the probandum that has been established can"	1
be proved for others by means of the reason and example established through direct	1
perception, inference and scriptural tradition. An entity is established 127 through	1
reasoning which consists in the proof of logical possibility; logical possi-	1
bility refers to the three types of [inferential] mark because they are the means of	1
"substantiating the probandum. The term: ""proof of logical possibility"""	1
(upapattisādhana) is a tatpurușa compound. The three types of [inferential] mark are	1
mentioned because the substantiation of that [proof] is on account of these. Reasoning	1
is the means, through the specific formulation of which, all that pertains to the three	1
types of [inferential] mark is stated. Alternatively, the logical possibility is that which	1
is not possible otherwise. The reasoning that consists in its proof refers to the [train of	1
thought] that connects the component parts of a syllogism - thus is the resolution of the	1
"term: ""reasoning that consists in the proof of logical possibility"""	1
(upapattisādhanayukti), Alternatively, it may be resolved as: 'the reasoning that	1
consists in the proof is logically possible' [i.e. as a karmadhārya compound]. The	1
"term: ""logical possibility"" is employed in order to distinguish this from the other"	1
reasonings of proofl28. In this way, based upon the three means of valid knowledge,	1
an entity consisting in either of the three natures which is established through the	1
reasoning of the proof of logical possibility is described as well established through	1
reasoning ¹29. The well established reality has now been described.	1

7. The Reality of the Sphere of Purity.	1
There is the reality of the twofold sphere of purity: (a) the sphere of	1
direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in moral	1
defilement and (b) the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of	1
obscuration that consists in the knowable. This [reality] is:	1
III.12 cd	0
A twofold sphere of purity; it is pro-	1
claimed as being due just to the one.	1
It is due just to the perfected nature for the other natures do not	1
belong to the sphere of the two pure direct intuitions.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y129.10 [1] Since the domain of purity should be mentioned immediately following the latter	1
[i.e. the well established reality], he says: there is the twofold reality of the	0
sphere of purity. Now, in order to demonstrate this twofold mode, he says: (a)	1
the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that	0
consists in moral defilement and (b) the sphere of direct intuition for	1
the purification of obscuration that consists in the knowable. The purifi-	1
cation of obscuration that consists in moral defilement is [equivalent to] the relinquish-	1
ment of obscuration that consists in moral defilement ¹30.	1
The term:	1
kleśăvaraṇaviśuddhijñāna may be interpreted either as [a dative or locative tatpuruşa	1
compound, i.e.:] the direct intuition: (a) leading to the purification of obscuration con-	1
sisting in moral defilement, or (b) in regard to the purification of obscuration consisting	1
in moral defilement. What is meant is [the direct intuition]: (a) that has the purification	1
of obscuration consisting in moral defilement for its aim, or (b) that causes that	1
"[purification]. The words: ""the sphere of that direct intuition for the purification of"	0
"obscuration consisting in moral defilement"" refer to [direct intuition which has the"	1
purification of that] for its object.131 The sphere of direct intuition for the purification	1
of obscuration that consists in the knowable should also be described in this way.	1
[2] Of these, obscuration that consists in moral defilement refers to all moral defile-	1
ments and secondary defilements that are to be relinquished by the paths ¹32 of vision	1
and meditative development. Hence the domain of the direct intuition in regard to	1
vision, meditative development and what relates to these two which is the reality of the	1
śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas133 is described as the truth of suffering, its origination,	0
130 Ms.(40a) line 2 begins: -varaṇaprahāṇam although Y's reading (p.129.13) would indicate that	0
these two words are fully reconstructed.	1

its cessation and the path (to the latter]. This is the sphere of the direct intuition for the	0
purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement. The knowable refers to	1
that which is to be known and this, collectively, comprises the five branches of learn-	1
ing. These are stated as the learning in regard to: (a) subjectivity, (b) grammatical anal-	1
ysis, (c) logic, (d) medicine and (e) all arts and crafts. The obscuration that consists in	1
the knowable refers to undefiled nescience which is an impediment to direct intuition in	1
regard to these. The purification of that is [the knowledge] comprised in the spiritual	1
level that is [equivalent to] the course of firm conviction which conforms with supra-	1
mundane direct intuition and [the knowledge] comprised in the eleven spiritual levels	1
beginning with the 'Joyous'. Moreover, [this purification] refers to the knowledge that	1
is attained subsequently to that [knowledge in the eleven levels]. This is present within	1
the mental continuum of the bodhisattvas and tathāgatas, and, since its objective	1
support is thusness because this has the sense of being all-pervading etc., the reality of	1
the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the	0
knowable is [equivalent to] thusness. [Objection]: Since the twofold sphere of purity	1
has already been explained by way of the description of both the reality of the cause	1
and result and the reality of the subtle, is it not so that their enumeration again here is	1
unnecessary? [Response]: It is not unnecessary because the reality of the cause and	1
result and of the subtle were formerly mentioned in order to define them as entities.	1
However, in this context, it concems the mode in which obscuration is purified, hence,	1
this [reality] is explained.	1
[3] This twofold sphere of purity is proclaimed as being due to just the one, i.e. it is	1
due just to the perfected nature. Here now he provides the reason for the	1
other natures do not belong to the sphere of the [two]134 pure direct	1
intuitions 135. What is the reason? Because unreal imagination [which is equivalent	1
to the other-dependent nature] is stained on account of its possession of the two stains	1
that comprise disquiet, and the imaginary [nature] does not exist. However, since real	1
nature is the domain of the twofold direct intuition, the reality of the domain of	1
purity 136 is determined as being just due to the perfected [nature]. The reality of the	1
sphere of purity has now been described.	1

8. The Inclusion Reality.	1

causal-sign, (b) conceptual differen-	1
tiation and (c) the name, within the	1
There is the inclusion	0

From the point of view of the five categories, according to which is	1

[Sthiramati]	0
[1] However, since the inclusion reality is to be mentioned immediately following the	1
latter [i.e. the reality of the sphere of purity], he asks: how should the inclusion	1
reality be understood in relation to the threefold137 basic reality? In order	1
to demonstrate that the inclusion reality is included within the threefold basic reality, he	1
says:	1
III.13 ab	1
There is the inclusion of: (a) the	1
causal-sign, (b) conceptual differen-	1
tiation and (c) the name, within the	1
These are included within the two: (a) the other-dependent and (b) the imaginary	0
[natures]. Therein, the inclusion reality comprises five categories, hence he says: from	1
the point of view of the five categories, according to which is appropri-	1
ate...	1
138 Five categories should be understood as being included within basic reality,	1
according to which is appropriate, but not according to sequential order. Now, the five	1
categories are: (a) the causal-sign, (b) the name, (c) conceptual differentiation, (d) thus-	1
137 Ms.(40b.1): trividhe; disregard Y's fn.1 p.131.	0
In the Ms.(40b.2) this passage reads as follows: tatra samgrahatattvam pañcavastūnity ata aha	1
yathayogam pañcavastiny ärabhyeti, however the Tib. has simply: de la bsdu ba'i de kho na ci	1
rigs su sbyar ro źes bya ba ni (D253a.3).Y132	1
ness and (e) correct direct intuition. These five categories are described as the inclu-	0
sion reality because all that is knowable is included within these five categories. In this	1
respect, some believe that the causal-sign refers to the store-consciousness, defiled	1
"mind and the actual consciousnesses. It is [described as the ""causal-sign"" because it"	1
"exists as a reciprocal cause. The ""name"" is an expression or indication of just that"	1
causal-sign although it is inexpressible, like [a gesture such as] the winking of the eye.	1
"""Conceptual differentiation"" refers to mind and the mental concomitants associated"	1
with all the three realms [of existence] which consist in conceptual differentiation, as	1
both own-being and particular, of the causal-sign as has just been described.	0
"""Thusness"" refers to emptiness. ""Correct direct intuition"" consists in the supra-"	1
mundane and has thusness for its objective support. Now, as to their sequential order:	1
the causal-sign comes first therein because it is the foundation for the designation as	1
the defilement; then comes the name because it is designated as the defilement; then	1
comes conceptual differentiation because as soon as it has a name, then conceptual	1
differentiation [occurs] in regard to that entity designated as a defilement; then comes	1
thusness and correct direct intuition because that defilement is checked on account of	0
thusness and correct direct intuition. Others believe that the meaning of these five	1
categories [is evident] in this verse:	1
Error is the cause of error, the cause of that	1
is disquiet. Therefore, the cause of the	1
latter is error¹39. But knowledge in this	1
regard 140 is intrinsically tranquil.	1
Therein, the cause of error¹41, which is incorporated in the internal consciousnesses of	1
sight etc., is external and internal error which are incorporated in form and the like and	1
sight and the like. Furthermore, the cause of this external and internal error¹42 is	1
disquiet and this is a latent impression of the store-consciousness. The cause of this	1
latent impression143 is none other than the external and internal error. As a conse-	1
quence, verbal expression in regard to it manifests and it is due to verbal expression	1
"that the latent impression is lodged in the store-consciousness. The term ""intrinsically"	1
"tranquil"" refers to thusness because the dharmadhātu is intrinsically undefiled ¹44. The"	1

N43.5	1
"words ""...but knowledge in this regard"", refer to that direct intuition included in the"	0
path which has thusness for its objective support.	1
[2] Of these, there is the inclusion of the causal-sign and conceptual	1
differentiation by way of the other-dependent [nature]145, because they are	1
produced through causes and conditions, and [the inclusion] of the name by	1
way of the imaginary [nature]. The name is included by way of the imaginary	1
[nature] because no object exists in keeping with its name; thus, by connection, there is	1
inclusion of name by way of the imaginary [nature] but its inclusion is not by way of	1
own-being. And if it is said that the imaginary nature in not included in the five cate-	1
gories beginning with the causal-sign because it is established as being devoid of own-	1
being, such a statement is not contradicted because in that context there is the desire to	1
state inclusion in terms of own-being.146	1
[There is the inclusion] of correct	1
direct intuition and true reality etc.	1
Reality that is eternal or pure is true reality 147, i.e. thusness. Correct direct intuition	1
refers to: (a) the direct intuition that has emptiness for its objective support and is free	1
from the duality and (b) the purified mundane [knowledge] that is attained subse-	1
quently to the latter. I.e. there is the inclusion of thusness and correct	1
direct intuition by way of just the one, i.e. the perfected nature because it is	0
perfected on account of its perfection that is respectively without change and is free	1
from erroneous inversion. The inclusion reality has now been described.	1

samgrhitam, cf. Bhaşya N42.21.	1
146 This passage evidently aims to reconcile the differing views held by the various Yogacara	1
schools concerning the relationship of the five vastu with the three svabhāva. For example, the	1
Yogācārabhūmi-viniscayasamgrahani (D22b.2) asserts that none of the five vastu are included	1
in the parikalpita svabhāva, i.e. the first four are included in the paratantra and only tathata is	1
parinişpanna. Cf. J.D.Willis: A Study of the Chapter on Reality... (pp.75-83) for a discussion	1
on this matter. The Lankavatāra Sūtra (Nanjio p.227.11) on the other hand apportions both	1
nāma and nimitta to the parikalpita, vikalpa to the paratantra and samyagjñāna and tathata to the	1
parinişpanna. Cf. also Siddhi (p.537 ff.) where the five vastu and three svabhāva are discussed	1
in the context of the nimittabhäga / darśanabhaga dichotomy.	1
Tib. omits satattvam; cf. D253b.7.177	1
tual practice, (f) the reality of purification and (g) the reality of correct	0
spiritual practice. 148 And these seven have been explained in the	1
Sandhinirmocana Sutra as [the sevenfold] thusness149. Of these:	1
III.14 a	1
The reality of continuance is	1
twofold;	1
Basic reality should be understood as being characterized by the	0
imaginary and other-dependent [natures]. Inasmuch as it is the reality	1
of continuance, similarly it is:	1
III.14 b	0
Arrangement and wrong course;	1
The realities of arrangement and wrong spiritual practice should be	0
understood 150 similarly as comprising two [of the three] kinds of basic	1
reality.	1
III.14 cd	1
The one consists in: (a) the charac-	1
teristic, (b) the representation, (c)	1
purification and (d) correct spiritual	0
practice.	1
The four realities beginning with that of the characteristic consist in	1
the one basic reality which is characterized by the perfected.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y133.8 [1] Now151, the variety [of the realities] that are found in relation to the reality of	1
differentiation and the way they are incorporated within basic reality is not known,	1
hence he asks: how should the reality of differentiation be understood in	1
relation to basic reality? Hence he replies: the reality of differentiation is	1
sevenfold. As to which these are, he says: (a) the reality of continuance, (b)	1
the reality of characteristic etc. The seven types of thusness described in the	1
Sandhinirmocana Sutra, beginning with the thusness of continuance and concluding	1
with the thusness of correct spiritual practice are [equivalent to] these described here as	1
the sevenfold reality of differentiation, beginning with the reality of continuance and	1
concluding with the reality of correct spiritual practice. Therein, the reality of contin-	1
uance refers to the beginningless and endless nature of samsāra; and this is also	1
148 The Sanskrit text of the Bhäşya includes a passage of text here which is partly incoherent and	0
does not appear relevant to the context. It is not found in the Tibetan or Chinese versions, nor	1
is it acknowledged in the Tika, hence it has been omitted from the translation. It reads as	1
follows: tatra pravṛttitattvaditrividham/ anavaragreşv eti samsāraḥ tathatacittasamkleśät sattvāḥ	1
samkliśyanta iti sarvam duḥkhādisatyam ca yathāsamkhyam. Cf. N's fn.4 p.43.	1
Cf. SN L99 & 219: # 20.2. Cf. also MSA XIX.44 (comm.) which follows the SN description	1
quite closely and also describes them as seven types of tathata.	1
Tib. inserts veditavyam (rig par bya) which is not found in the Sanskrit; (cf. D13a.4).	1
Ms.(41a.4): idän-; disregard Y's fn.3 p.133.	1

[equivalent to] the thusness of continuance because by no means does [samsăra] have	1
a beginning. The reality of characteristic is [equivalent to] the insubstantiality of the	1
personal entity and the dharmas; and since it is not something other this is also	1
equivalent to the thusness of characteristic 152, (c) The reality of representation	1
is [equivalent to the state of mere-representation of the dharmas. Others believe that	1
the reality of representation refers to the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differen-	1
tiation because this is the basis of representation 153. And since the reality of repre-	1
sentation is not something other, it is also described as the thusness of representation.	1
(d) The reality of arrangement is [equivalent to] the truth of suffering because	1
the formative forces are arranged [i.e. established] in suffering; and this is lequivalent	1
to] thusness considering that it is eternally just thus. (e) The reality of wrong	1
spiritual practice is [equivalent to] the truth of origination and this refers to the	1
continuance that is on account of the perception of virtue in regard to those formative	1
forces. (f) The reality of purification is [equivalent to] the purification of obscu-	1
ration that consists in moral defilement154 and this refers to thusness and the truth of	0
cessation. Others believe that the nature of the turning about of the basis, i.e. the nature	0
of cessation155, is [equivalent to] the truth of cessation. (g) The reality of correct	1
spiritual practice is [equivalent to] the truth of the path. Others believe that the	1
reality of representation156 is a fundamental application and that the reality of correct	1
spiritual practice and the reality of representation are [equivalent to] just the truth of the	1
path. Moreover, since these three realities are eternally just thus, they are described as	1
thusness.	1
[2] Of these:	1
III.14 a	1
The reality of continuance is	1
twofold;	1
Basic reality 157 should be understood as being characterized by the	0
imaginary and the other-dependent [natures]. Continuance therein refers to	1
the continuity of creatures who have no beginning, and since this [continuity] does not	1
exist, it consists in the imaginary nature. However, these [creatures] consist in the	1
other-dependent nature because their continuity is constituted by causes. In this way,	1
both the continuance and those for whom there is continuance are explained as the	1

karma and rebirth is described as the continuance of samsara and this is characterized	1
by notional attachment to the imaginary nature, hence, the reality of the twofold contin-	1
uance is described as basic reality.	1
[3] Similarly it is:	1

Arrangement and wrong course158;	1
Wrong course is [equivalent to] wrong spiritual practice; these [should be under-	1

because they have the imaginary [nature] for their object, the realities of arrangement	1
and wrong spiritual practice are incorporated in these two [of the threefold basic	1
realities].	1

of purification and the reality of correct spiritual practice. These four realities consist in	1
just the one basic reality, namely, the perfected nature. Therein, the reality of charac-	1
teristic and the reality of purification are perfected insofar as they consist in the perfec-	1
tion ¹60 that cannot be otherwise. The reality of representation and the reality of correct	1
spiritual practice are perfected insofar as they consist in the perfection that is free from	1
erroneous inversion.	1
[4] Herein, the sameness of sentient beings is shown through the three realities of	1
continuance, arrangement and wrong spiritual practice. The sameness of the dharmas	1
[is shown] through the two realities of characteristic and representation. The sameness	1
of enlightenment [is shown] through the reality of purification. The sameness of	1
wisdom is demonstrated through the reality of correct spiritual practice. Hence it is	1
said:	1
The sameness of sentient beings is pro-	1
claimed through the three, but the sameness	1
of the dharmas through the two. Thus the	1
sameness of enlightenment and wisdom is	1
demonstrated singly.	1

10. The Reality of the Skills.	1
The reality of the skills is said to act as the counteragent to false	1
views. What are the tenfold false views concerning the self [which	1
manifest] in regard to the aggregates etc.?	0
III.15 abcd & 16 ab	1
The false views concerning the self	1
[which manifest] in regard to these	1
[aggregates etc.] are in relation to:	1
(a) oneness, (b) causality, (c) an	1
experiencer, (d) an agent, (e) inde-	1
pendence, (f) sovereignty, (g) per-	1
mancnce, (h) a basis for defilement	1
and purification, (i) a yogi and (j)	1
release and non-release.	0
There are ten kinds of	1
skill that act as the counteragents to these ten	1
kinds of adherence to the belief in a non-existent self which manifests	1
in regard to the aggregates etc. These [adherences] are: (a) The adher-	1
ence to the belief in its oneness. (b) The adherence to the belief in its	1
causality. (c) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an experi-	1
encer. (d) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an agent.	1
(e) The	1
adherence to the belief in its independence. (F) The adherence to the	1
belief in its sovereignty. (g)	1
The adherence to the belief in its perma-	1
nence. (h) The adherence to the belief in its defilement or purification.	1
(i) The adherence to the belief in its nature as a yogi. (j) The adher-	1
ence to the belief in its release or non-release.	1
How can this tenfold reality of skills be included within basic real-	1
ity? Because the aggregates etc. are included in the three natures. How	1
are they included?	1
III.16 cd	1
The former are [included] within the	1
latter by way of: (a) the imaginary,	1
(b) conceptual differentiation and (c)	1
real nature.	0
Form is threefold: (a) Imaginary form, i.e. the imaginary nature that	1
belongs to form. (b) Conceptually differentiated form, i.e. the other-	1
dependent nature that belongs to form since it is in relation to that	1
[nature] that [an entity] is conceptually differentiated as form.	1
(c) Form	1
as real nature, i.e. the perfected nature that belongs to form. The	1
aggregates, such as sensation, and also the elements and sense-fields	1
etc. should be construed in the same way as form [has been construed	1
above]. Thus, since the aggregates etc. are included within the three	1
natures the tenfold reality of skills should also be understood in rela-	1
tion to basic reality. Although it has been stated that the skill in the	1
aggregates etc. acts as the counteragent to the ten kinds false view in	1
regard to the self, the meaning of the aggregates etc. has not been	1
stated. This will now be discussed.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y135.19 [1] The reality of the skills was listed immediately after the reality of differentiation 161,	1
so in order to clearly illustrate this he says: the reality of the skills is said to act	1
as the counteragent to false views 162. Moreover, since it is not known as to	1
how the tenfold false views concerning the self [manifest] in regard to the aggregates	1
etc., he asks: which are the tenfold false views concerning the self [that	1
manifest] in regard to these163 [aggregates etc.]? Hence he says:	1
III.15 abcd & 16 ab	1
The false views concerning the self	1
[which manifest] in regard to these	1
[aggregates etc.] are in relation to:	1
(a) oneness, (b) causality, (c) an	1
experiencer, (d) an agent, (e) inde-	1
pendence, (f) sovereignty, (g) perma-	1
nence, (h) a basis for defilement and	1
purification, (i) a yogi and (j) release	1
and non-release. 164	1
It is the fact that [these false views arise] in regard to the aggregates etc. that is referred	1
to. However, these ten kinds of adherence to the belief in a non-existent	1
self165...; this says that there is the adherence to the belief in what is non-existent	1

because the self does not exist.166 [Objection]: If the self does not exist how do these	1
adherences which are dependent upon the other, i.e. the apprehended object, manifest,	1
when they are devoid of an object? [Response]: But they are not devoid of an object;	1
they manifest in regard to the aggregates etc. Therefore, it is said that there	1
are ten kinds of skill in regard to the aggregates etc. which act as the counter-	1
agents to these167. How does this adherence [manifest] in regard to just the aggre-	1
gates etc. although the self cannot be positively determined to exist? Because, when it	1
is closely examined through reasoning, the self that is separate from the aggregates etc.	1
cannot be discerned; indeed all the deeds and essential nature that belong to the self,	1
which those who believe in the self maintain, manifest only in regard to the aggregates	1
etc. Hence it is evident that it is just the aggregates etc. which form the substratum for	1
the adherence to the belief in the self. Since this adherence to the self, on the part of	0
those who are notionally attached to the self168, manifests in these ten forms and not in	1
others, the skills in regard to the aggregates etc. should be understood as the counter-	0
agent to all adherence to the belief in the self. These [adherences] are 169: (a) The	1
adherence to the belief in its oneness; this is due to the adherence to the belief	1
in the self as a whole entity among the five aggregates that have been appropriated.	1
The skill in the aggregates acts as the counteragent to this. (b) The adherence to	1
the belief in its causality; the adherence to the belief in causality in regard to the	1
self is because sight and the like promote [such an adherence]. The skill in regard to	1
the elements (dhātu)170 acts as the counteragent to this. The adverse [adherence] and	1
its counteragent should be stated similarly in regard to the other [sense faculties].	1
Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its causality 171 [is also explained as] the	1
notion that everything proceeds from the self; i.e. the adherence to the belief in its	1
causality refers to the volition that consists in the notion that the self is the cause of	1
virtuous and non-virtuous action for which there is an agreeable or disagreeable result	1
in this birth¹72. (c) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an experi-	0
encer; [the notion that] the self is the agent of experience because it consists in voli-	1
tion, but the 'manifest' and 'unmanifest' [of the Samkhya] 173 is an object of experience	1
because it does not consist in volition. Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its	1
nature as an experiencer refers to the notion that an internal agent of virtuous and non-	1

virtuous actions is the experiencer of the result of those [actions]. (d) The adher-	0
ence to the belief in its nature as an agent; the belief that the self is the	0
agent174 of properly performed and wrongly performed actions. Alternatively, the	1
adherence to the belief in its agency refers to the notion that the self possesses instru-	1
mentality etc.175 (e) The adherence to the belief in its independence¹76; [the	1
notion that] the self exerts influence of its own accord; i.e. the notion that it is the self	1
that holds sway. Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its independence refers to	1
the notion that it exerts an influence in the production of the result which is in confor-	1
mityli	1
177 with the cause. (f) The adherence to the belief in its sovereignty; the	0
notion that the self is the ruler, the master, or the iśvara. Alternatively, the adherence to	1
the belief in its sovereignty refers to the notion that the self rules over activity that con-	1
forms with the result178. (g) The adherence to the belief in its perma-	1
nence 179; the notion that, although it is impure in terms of the five entities beginning	0
with cause, the self is definitely permanent, otherwise there would be the imputation of	1
action not performed and the loss of action that has been performed 180 [i.e. if there is	0
no ātman, an action performed by A would be imputed to B and the result of an action	1
performed by A would not be obtained by A] and similarly there would be an absence	1
of memory and recognition. (h) The adherence to the belief in its defilement	1
and purification; because [one would believe that] it is the basis of defilement and	1
purification. (i) The adherence to the belief in its nature as a yogi; yoga is	1
the fixation of the mind upon the self or the suppression of the breath and the mind.	0
Yoga is the special union of self with mind a yogi means one who has it [i.e. yoga].	1
And (j) the adherence to the belief in its release and non-release; i.e. the	1
conceptual differentiation that the self is liberated from a previous [state of]	1
bondage 181	1

[2] How is this tenfold [reality of]182 the skills included within basic	1
reality? 183 Because kill refers to proficiency¹84 in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
How can this be included within the three natures? This question is posed by one who	1
thinks this to be impossible185. Because the aggregates etc. are included in	1
the three natures. The fact that [the aggregates] relate to the domain of the skills is	1
"shown by the word ""skill"", but they do not relate to skill alone; hence the reality of the"	1
skills should be understood as being included therein by way of connection, but not by	1
way of own-being. Just as the truth of the path, which consists in the reality of the	1
cause and result, is said to be included within the three [natures]. Although this may	1
be so,	1
it is not known just how they are included, hence it is asked: how are they	1
included?186 Hence he says:	1
III.16 cd	0
It is the fact that the aggregates etc. are included within these three natures that is	1
referred to. In this context, the inclusion of the aggregates is to be elucidated firstly	1
because they were listed prior to the elements etc. and since they pertain to form, he	1
says: form is threefold. How so? As: (a) imaginary form, (b) conceptually differ-	1
entiated form and (c) form as real nature. What is (a) imaginary forml	1
188 therein? It	1
is the imaginary nature belonging to form; i.e. that which, with the exception	1
of its perception by way of name, is imagined in this regard as the own-being of the	1
sense-object. Because this is absolutely non-existent it is described as imaginary. (b)	1
Conceptually differentiated form, i.e. the other-dependent nature	1
belonging to form; what is meant is: it is dependent upon causes and conditions.	0
But why is this described as conceptually differentiated form? Hence he says: since	1
it is in relation to that [nature] that [an entity] is conceptually differen-	1
tiated as form. Due to a failure in clear comprehension 189 on account of their lack	1
of insight into reality, people are notionally attached to form because of the fact that	1
they perceive consciousness in the appearance of form 190. just as form [i.e. as matter,	1
The former are [included] within the	0

pure and simple], as for instance, one grasps at a self among the aggregates. There-	0
fore, it is said that form is conceptually differentiated in relation to the other-dependent	1
[nature]. (c) Form as real nature, i.e. the perfected nature that belongs to	1
form. This refers to emptiness whose nature is devoid of both imaginary form and	1
conceptually differentiated form. The aggregates, such as sensation, and also	1
the elements and sense-fields etc. 191 should be construed in the same	1
way as form [has been construed above], i.e. in the same way that form is	1
"included in the three natures after having differentiated it as threefold. [By ""etc."" is"	1
meant]: the aggregates that consist in sensation, perception, the formative forces and	1
consciousness, as well as the elements, the sense-fields, the limbs of dependent origi-	1
nation, the worthy and unworthy objects, the sense faculties, the three times192, the	1
four truths, the three vehicles and both the conditioned and the unconditioned. More-	1
over, [all] that pertains to sensation etc. and the elements etc., individually, are to be	1
included in the three natures after distinguishing them as threefold according to the	1
differences in their essential natures as imaginary 193, conceptually differentiated and	1
real nature.	1
[3] Therein, in the same way that [an entity] in the appearances of form is imagined as	1
the apprehended object, [so too] that absolutely non-existent existence of apprehending	1
subject and apprehended object, which is imagined in relation to the appearances of	1
sensation etc., is [described as] imaginary sensation, up to and concluding with imagi-	1
nary consciousness. Conceptually differentiated sensation, up to and concluding with	1
conceptually differentiated consciousness, refers to that [sensation] in regard to which	1
the conceptual differentiation as apprehending subject and apprehended object is	1
performed. Sensation as real nature refers to the perfected nature pertinent to	1
sensation; it is to be understood in the same way [for the other aspects] up to and con-	1
cluding with consciousness as real nature. In detail, it should be stated in the same	1
way, according to the circumstances, in regard to the elements and sense-fields etc.	1
[4] An entity that is to be nominally designated as form or sensation, and so on up to	1
and concluding with the conditioned and unconditioned, should also be understood as	0
consisting in the imaginary, the other-dependent and the perfected 194 natures. How so?	1
The imaginary consists therein because [an entity] is designated as of the essential	1
nature of form etc. The other-dependent [consists therein] since it is this which is the	1
support for the designation because it depends upon other causal conditions. That	1
which is absolutely devoid of an entity of form etc. is the perfected.	1

[5] [Objection]: Since only the other-dependent [nature] is nominally described as an	1
entity of form etc.195 and the imaginary is not, the conceptual differentiation of the	1
imaginary is meaningless. [Response]: It is not meaningless because the essential	1
nature of form etc. is superimposed on that [i.e. the imaginary nature] since the object	1
does not exist in exactly that way in which 196 the name is used in regard to it; however,	1
naive people are notionally attached to its essential nature. [Objection]: Why is it that	1
one is attached to it but not ¹97 as an object [existing] in reality? [Response]: Because	1
there is the exclusion from the relation of 'signified' and 'signifier' on the part of the	1
name and the object be they similar or dissimilar; i.e. if the words for trees etc. and	1
their objects were not different by nature then the name's capacity to signify would be	1
excluded, like the object, because it would not be distinct from the essential nature of	1
the object. And the object's capacity to be signified would disappear because it would	1
not be distinct from the essential nature of the name, due to the absence of a specific	1
cause [i.e. which causes the existence of that which is to be signified]. Alternatively,	1
since there would be one 'signifier 198 belonging to the name and a different 'signified'	1
belonging to the object, there would be an endless series of statements. Moreover, if	1
there were numerous names for the one object and numerous objects for the one	1
name199, there would be multiple essential natures; however, it is untenable that the one	1
[entity] can have multiple natures 200. Moreover, a 'signifier' of non-existence would	1
not exist, like the object, because the object would be [of the nature of]201 a non-exis-	1
tent; alternatively, if the name were to exist its object would also exist. In regard to	1
dissimilarity, there would be no ascertainment of [the existence of an object con-	1
formable with a word, since in this regard a 'tree' is only a word, it is not an object.	1
However, the object is not a 'tree' nor is it a 'non-tree'. Therefore, the object of the	1
word 'tree' is not the sphere of the knowledge of the 'tree' because the object of that	1
[word] does not have the nature of a tree. In this way202 there is the exclusion of the	1
word and the object from the relation of 'signified' and 'signifier'. In regard to dispar-	1
ity, there would be no determination of 'signified' and 'signifier because of the absence	1
of a determining cause.	1
[6] There is a theory that the name may generate the object or cause it to become mani-	1
fest. In this regard, [the name] does not generate [the object] because the name is	1
applied to the object only after it has arisen. This would lead to the conclusion that,	1

although the object] has [already] arisen, it would be generated again and again	0
because the name is applied again and again. Nor does [the name] cause [the object] to	1
become manifest because the name is applied after the object is apprehended and it is	1
not tenable that it would cause the manifestation of what has not been apprehended 203,	1
i.e. another person who does not know an object will not apprehend it with the same	1
name; also, it is not tenable that that same [name] can cause both the manifestation and	1
the non-manifestation of the same object. Lamps etc. which cause things to become	1
manifest do not cause the manifestation of a manifest204 object in dependence upon	1
knowledge 205. Also, since no determining cause of manifestation is seen in regard to	1
manifest206	1
pots and clothing etc., all objects would be caused to manifest by all names.	0
Moreover, there would be no determination by way of smell etc.207 because axes and	1
water etc. are considered to be agents that generate smell etc., but not things that cause	1
manifesta Therefore, it is evident that the notional attachment to the 'signified' and	0
'signifier', like the notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject208, is meaningless.	1
[7] Thus, since the aggregates etc. are included within the three natures,	1
the tenfold reality of the skills should also be understood in relation to	1
basic reality. Although it has been stated that the skill in the aggregates	1

self, the meaning of the aggregates etc., in regard to which the skill in the	1

Now at the beginning these, i.e. the aggregates, should be under-	1
stood in a threefold sense: (a) In the sense of 'multiple'; in detail it is	1
"said: ""any form belonging to the past, present or future..."" (b) In the"	1
sense of 'collected'; i.e. [the same scriptural reference continues]:	1
"""...after collecting all that [form] together..."" And (c) in the sense of"	1
'disparate'; because the characteristic of form etc. is respectively deter-	1
mined as separate. For 'aggregate' (skandha) has the sense of 'heap'	1
(răsi) and thus is it generally understood in the sense of a 'heap'.	1

"The term: ""at the beginning""211 refers to the fact that [the aggregates] are stated initially."	0
Now at the beginning these, i.e. the aggregates are described and they	1
should be understood in a threefold sense: (a) In the sense of	1
"'multiple'212; [in detail it is said]: ""any form213 belonging to the past,"	1
present or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or exalted, distant or	1
"near...""214; thus [they should be understood] in the sense of 'multiple' because numer-"	1
ous substantial entities of the past etc. 215 are described by the word 'aggregate'. The	1
aggregates [should be understood]; (b) in the sense of 'collected' because of the	1
"scriptural statement: ""...after collecting together..."". By ""after collecting"	1
"...together"" is meant: after making into one216. (c) In the sense of 'disparate'; it"	1
"is the aggregates that are referred to. The word ""and"" has a collective sense, i.e. this"	1
belongs with the previous two statements: i.e. in the sense of 'multiple' and in the sense	1
of 'collected'. Here now he gives the reason: because the characteristic of form	1
etc. 217, belonging to the aggregates, is respectively determined as separate,	1
"from the characteristic of sensation etc. The words ""separate"" and ""disparate"" are"	1
synonyms. What is the reason that in this context the meaning of the aggregates is	1
respectively determined in terms of these three aspects? For 'aggregate' (skandha)	1

has the sense of 'heap' (rasi)218, hence, and thus is it generally under-	1
stood, i.e. established. Thus, what is generally understood as 'multiple', 'collected'	1
and 'disparate' is described as a 'heap'. The aggregates of sensation etc. are to be	1
understood in the same way as the aggregates of form. Therein, an act of skill in	1
regard to the meaning of the aggregates is described as the counteragent to the adher-	1
ence to the belief in a unique self, namely, such as that all this that has been and will be	1
in the future is none other than the puruşa [of the Samkya]. How so? Because form	1
etc., differentiated as belonging to the past etc. and collected together as a unity, is	0
designated as the aggregate of form etc. Moreover, the aggregates are respectively	1
determined as threefold as counteragents to three kinds of confusion; the three kinds of	1
confusion are: (a) confusion in regard to singularity, (b) confusion in regard to the	1
conventional and (c) confusion concerning the mixture of characteristics.	1

b. The Meaning of the Elements.	1
The next is considered in the sense	1
of the 'seed' of: (a) the apprehending	1
subject, (b) the apprehended object	1
and (c) the perception of the latter.	1
What is next? The elements. In the above, (a) the sense of the 'seed'	1
of the apprehending subject refers to the elements of sight etc.; (b) the	1
sense of the 'seed' of the apprehended object refers to the elements of	1
form etc.; and (c) the sense of the 'seed' of the perception of the latter	1
refers to the elements of sight-consciousness etc.	1

meaning of the elements immediately following the meaning of the aggregates.	1

ately after the aggregates; this is why the author of the commentary also says: what is	1

when there is gold220 it is said to be the element gold the 'seed' of gold is thus under-	0
stood. Moreover, this is distinguished as threefold because of the difference in result:	1
(a) the element that consists in the apprehending subject, (b) the element that consists in	1
the apprehended object and (c) the element that consists in the perception of the latter.	1
In the above, (a) the sense of the 'seed' of the apprehending subject	1
refers to the element of sight etc.221; the element of sight is the first of the	1
elements which begin with sight and conclude with mind. They are [described as]	1
apprehending subjects because they form the basis for the perception of sense-objects	1
of form etc. They are described as elements because they are the cause of [the elements	1
of sight etc. of the same genus. (b) The sense of the 'seed' of the appre-	1
hended object refers to the elements of form etc., concluding with the non-	1
sensuous element. Because they are the objects of sight-consciousness etc. 222 they are	1
[described as] apprehended objects. These too are described as elements because they	1
are thus causes [in the production] of the form etc. of a similar nature. (c) The sense	1
of the 'seed' of the perception of the latter refers to the elements of	1
sight-consciousness etc.; the perceptions regard to form etc. are those which	1
begin with sight-consciousness and conclude with mind-consciousness because they	1
have the knowledge of form etc. for their own-being. These too are described as ele-	1
ments because they are causes [in the production] of the sight-consciousness etc. of a	1
similar nature, i.e. beginning with the element of sight-consciousness and concluding	1
with the element of mind-consciousness.	1
[2] However, others say223 that the store-consciousness, imbued with the latent	1
impressions of 224 the karma of notional attachment to sight etc., is the 'seed' of those	1
respective [elements] of sight etc. Similarly, the store-consciousness, imbued with225	1
[the latent impressions of 226 the karma inherent to the notional attachment to form etc.,	1
is the 'seed' of those respective [elements] of form etc. Likewise, just the store-	1
consciousness, imbued with the latent impressions of the karma inherent to the	1
notional attachment to sight-consciousness etc., is the 'seed' of those respective	1
[elements] of sight-consciousness etc. [Objection]: If this is so, the following should	1
be reflected upon: it would be just the store-consciousness that is signified by the word	1
"""element"" and not (the faculty of sight etc. [Response]: The elements have been"	1
respectively determined in this threefold sense as 'seed' in order to remove confusion	1
concerning: (a) the agent, (b) the deed and (c) the karma. In this respect, the former	1

[element of] sight etc. is the cause of just the latter [element of sight etc. and there is	0

elements.	1

c. The Meaning of the Sense-Fields.	1
The next [is considered] as the	1
medium of origination for the experi-	1
ence of: (a) sensation and (b) the	1
discrimination of an object;	1
What is next? The sense-fields. Of these, the six internal sense-	0
fields [are considered] in the sense of the medium of origination for the	1
experience of sensation. The six external [sense-fields are considered]	1
in the sense of the medium of origination for the experience of the dis-	1
crimination of an object.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y144.19 [1] The meaning of the sense-fields should be mentioned immediately following the	1
meaning of the elements, hence he says:	1
III.18 ab	0
The next [is considered] as the	1
medium of origination for the experi-	1
ence of: (a) sensation and (b) the	1
discrimination of the object;227	1
Since there are numerous [topics] apart from the elements such as the sense-fields and	1
"dependent origination and also because of the general nature of the word ""next"", he"	1
"poses the question: what is next? This word ""next"", as a matter of course, stands"	1
just for the sense-fields because they were listed immediately following the elements,	1
thus in order to show this, he says: it refers to the sense-fields. Of these, the	1
six internal sense-fields [are considered] in the sense of the medium of	1
origination for the experience of sensation228. The six external sense-	1
fields [are considered] in the sense of the medium of origination for the	1
experience of the discrimination of the object. The medium of origination	1
(āyadvāra) is equivalent in meaning to sense-field (ayatana). Origination (āya) is	1

228 Read: veditopabhogayadvärärthena in place of vedanopabhogayadvärärthena, cf. Bhaşya N45 15.I	1
[equivalent to] an arrival; they are sense-fields (ayatanăni) insofar as they propagate	0
(tanvanti) that [which originates] among the experience of sensation and the discrimi-	1
nation of an object. This differentiation as internal and external is according to the	0
difference in the medium of origination for an experience either as sensation or	1
conceptualization. Sensations are either pleasurable, painful or neither pleasurable nor	1
painful. Because the latter are partaken of (upabhujyate), they are [described as]	1
enjoyment (upabhoga); what is meant is: they are experienced (anubhūyate). Only the	1
internal sense-fields 229 are described as the medium of origination 230 for that experi-	1
ence of sensation because, although the sense-objects are the medium of the origination	1
of that [sensation], the support231 i.e. sight etc., is the basis on account of the fact that:	1
(a) it is helpful or obstructive, (b) it consists in clear comprehension in regard to that	1
[sensation] and (c) it is specific, since the experience of sensation [occurs] by means of	1
it when there is sight etc. and [the experience of sensation] does not [occur] when there	1
is no [sight etc. 1232. The discrimination of an object refers to conceptualization	1
(samjñā) because it has the nature of the apprehension of the sign of the object. This	1
consists in the experience of sense-objects 233 because it has the nature of the know-	1
ledge of objects. The external sense-fields are described as the medium of origination	1
for those [conceptualizations]; but not the internal [sense-fields], for, even if they were	1
the medium of origination for those [conceptualizations], in the absence of a sense	1
object, there is no experiencing of the discrimination of the object234 even if the internal	1
sense-fields of sight etc. do exist. The sense-fields should be known because they are	1
the medium of origination for both sensations and the discrimination of objects	1
together with their associated elements.	1
[2] The two apprehendings are very important. Furthermore, apprehending is very	1
important because it consists in the experience of the result of karma and also because	1
it consists in the discrimination of objects. Since there is the conceptual differentiation	1
of an agent of experience on account of the experience of sensation and the discrimina-	1
tion of objects, the sense-fields are respectively determined 235 in a twofold sense.	1
Thus, skill in the sense-fields [leads to the understanding that] the agent of experience	1
consists in the internal sense-fields and the object of experience consists in the external	1
sense-fields. And since no other236 agent of experience exists, the adherence to the	1
belief in the self as the agent of experience is checked.	1

[3] [Objection]: The assertion that was made above is not tenable, i.e. that because the	1
sense-fields of sight etc. are helpful or obstructive it is just the support of that	1
[sensation] which is conventionally expressed as the agent of experience because, on	1
account of the denial of [the existence of] form, the sense-fields of sight etc. would	1
also not exist, like the self. [Response]: This censure is not appropriate because it is	1
only imaginary form that is denied here, not conceptually differentiated form. In the	1
above, the internal sense-field is the store-consciousness which undergoes a special	1
transformation on account of its projection by the karma that is imbued with the	1
conceptual elaborations of sight etc. The external sense-field is the appearance as form	1
etc. and belongs to the actual consciousness which has the latter [i.e. the store-	1
consciousness] as its cause. The appearance as a common object and the237 appearance	1
as sentient beings belong to the store-consciousness and are described as the external	1
sense-field because they are the predominant-causal conditions in the arising of the	1
actual consciousness which appears as the apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject. However, it is not because these [external sense-fields] consist in the sense	1
object.	1
[4] [Objection]: Is it not so that this (interpretation] conflicts with the words of the	1
Sūtras which state that sight-consciousness and the like are produced in dependence	1
upon the two [i.e. sense faculty and external object]? The appearance as form etc.238 is	1
different from consciousness and it is not tenable that it alone can be the causal condi-	1
tion for the arising of just itself because of the existence of the arisen and the non-	1
existence of the non-arisen states239, and because action in regard to itself is contra-	1
dictory. Therefore, form and the like should necessarily be acknowledged as being	1
different from their appearances in consciousness. [Response]: This censure is not	1
appropriate because consciousness in the appearance of form etc. deposits the (causal)	1
latent impression 240 in the causal consciousness for the arising of a consciousness of a	1
similar nature; and due to a transformation in the latent impression, consciousness in	1
the appearance of form etc. is born again. In this way, consciousness, when it has	1
deposited a latent impression in the nature of an appearance of form etc.241, is	1
described as the causal condition for consciousness, hence there is no contradiction	1
with the Sutras. Thus, the meaning of 'support', too, is appropriate for the appearance	1
as form etc. because it is the causal condition for consciousness in (the aspect of 242 its	0
own appearance. Alternatively, that which is innate to consciousness is established as	1

the objective support-causal condition by those who hold to the [existence of the]	0
external object by way of connection with the fact that the existence or non-existence of	1
consciousness is due to the existence or non-existence of that [causal condition for the	1
objective support] although there is no relation of producer and produced. Similarly,	1
here too, although the appearance of form etc. and consciousness do not have243 the	1
relation of that which is produced and producer, they are respectively determined as the	1
causal condition and the possessor of the causal condition because there is no falla-	1
cious reasoning regarding the existence or non-existence of consciousness as being	1
due to the existence or non-existence of that [causal condition for the objective	1
support].	1
[5] [Objection]: There would be no actual correspondence with an example for both	1
the appearance of form etc. and consciousness because they cannot be differentiated.	0
[Response]: This is not so because they are figurative differences244; for example, the	1
consciousness of dreams, magical creations and cities of Gandharvas and the like,	0
although ultimately undifferentiated, is respectively determined in the relation of that	1
which is supported and the supporter just as it is (conventionally)245 differentiated in	1
the aspects of apprehended object and apprehending subject because it is the basis for	0
the conceptual differentiation of apprehended object and apprehending subject. Like-	1
wise, there is no contradiction in the other cases too. Moreover, the relation of that	1
which is supported and the supporter is, in all cases, only expressed figuratively; it	1
does not actually exist. Because, whether consciousness has or has not arisen, it does	1
not take a sense-object as objective support due to the fact that this [object] passes	1
away immediately upon origination since [in the former case] it does not continue to	1
exist at the time of the act of supporting and because [in the latter case] it does not	1
exist. Also, the sense-object is not tenable as the objective support whether it has or	1
has not arisen or has both [arisen and not arisen], because: (a) it does not continue to	1
exist when it has arisen and (b) that which has not arisen does not exist, since the act of	1
supporting devoid of a foundation is not tenable. An objective support for the	1
presently existing consciousness is meaningless since it is through the mere fact of its	1
existence that the relation of cause and result is determined 246 as the relation of that	1
which is supported and the supporter because it is established as having the nature of	1
that [which is supported]. Also, [the objective support] for that [consciousness] which	1
is in the process of arising is meaningless because it does not [yet] exist. [Objection]:	1
[an objective support for that consciousness] in the process of arising is not meaning-	1

less because when the sense-object really exists, consciousness acquires the nature of	0
an appearance as the latter. [Response]: If the appearance as the object were caused by	1
an object that is external to consciousness, then the consciousness of things belonging	1
to the past, the future or to dreams would be devoid of aspect (niräkära), or else would	1
not exist because of the non-existence of the object of those [things belonging to the	1
past etc.]. An effect cannot be produced by causal conditions that are deficient247 since	1
this would transcend the bounds of logic248 and the assertion that something non-exis-	1
tent can possess a causal condition is also not tenable. Moreover, the external object is	1
not the causal condition of the objective support for consciousness since the latter	1
exists even without the former. Therefore, all consciousness of people who have	1
ophthalmia is to be acknowledged as having no dependence on an objective support	0
that consists in the external object.	1
d. The Meaning of Dependent Origination.	1
The meaning of dependent origination:	1

[It is considered in the sense of the	1
absence of both imputation and	1
negation in regard to cause, result	1

Dependent origination is considered] in the sense of the absence of	1
both the imputation and negation of cause, result and efficacy. In this	1
respect, (a) there is the imputation of causality due to imagining that the	1
formative forces etc. have dissimilar causes. (b) There is the negation	1
of causality due to imagining that [the latter] are devoid of causality.	1
(c) There is the imputation of result due to imagining that the formative	1
forces etc., together with the self, manifest from causal conditions such	1
as ignorance. (d) There is the negation of result due to imagining that	1
the formative forces etc., which have ignorance etc. for their causal	0
conditions, do not exist. (e) There is the imputation of efficacy due to	1
imagining that ignorance etc. is instrumental in the production of the	1
formative forces etc. (f) There is the negation of efficacy due to imag-	1
ining that [the latter] are devoid of power. The absence of both impu-	1
tation and negation should be understood as being due to the non-exis-	1
tence of these [conditions).	1

Y148.6 [1] Since the meaning of dependent origination should be mentioned immediately after	1
the meaning of the sense-fields, he says: the meaning of dependent origination:	1

absence of both	0
negation in regard	0
and activity. 249	1
cause, result	0
It means: arisen from causal conditions that are inactive, impermanent and have power;	0
"as has been stated in a Sutra: ""when this exists, there is that. Due to the arising of this,"	1
that is produced in detail: the formative forces have ignorance for their causal condi-	0
"tion."" In order to illustrate that in this context dependent origination is considered by"	1
way of the refutation of the imputation and negation of cause, result and efficacy, he	1
says: dependent origination [is considered] in the sense of the absence of	1
both the imputation250 and negation of cause, result and efficacy.	1
"""Efficacy"" is stated by the word: ""activity""."	1
[2] In this respect, there is the imputation of causality...; this is due to	1
imagining that the purușa, the iśvara, the atom 251 or the pradhana etc. possess causality,	1
having rejected ignorance etc. [as the cause]. In order to demonstrate this, he says:	1
...due to imagining that the formative forces etc., concluding with old-age	1
"and death, have dissimilar causes. ""Dissimilar"" refers to the notion that some-"	1
thing permanent such as the puruşa can be the cause of the formative forces etc. which	1
are impermanent; what is meant is: 'different' [i.e. that a cause can produce something	1
that is of a completely different nature to itself]. Alternatively, a cause is considered to	1
require a modification of its essential nature, like the seed in relation to the sprout etc.,	1
but there can be no modification of essential nature on the part of that which is per-	1
manent. The imputation of causality is due to imagining causality in regard to a [result	1
that is dissimilar [to its] cause.	1
[3] There is the negation of causality due to imagining that [the latter]	1
are devoid of causality 252, ...; if one agrees that the formative forces etc. are	1
produced without a cause, ignorance etc. is excluded as the cause of the formative	1
forces etc.-	1

causal conditions such as ignorance if the self exists, but do not [manifest] if it does	1
not exist. Thus, there is the im tion of result if the self is imputed upon the result	1
such as the formative forces 255. Others believe that the imputation of result is due to	1
imagining that the formative forces etc., together with the self, manifest from causal	1
conditions such as ignorance, either by being intimately connected with a substantial256	1
self or by being an agent that is beneficial or obstructive257 to the latter.	1
[5] There is the negation of result due to imagining that the formative	1
forces etc., which have ignorance for their causal condition, do not	1
exist258; for example 259, there are heretics who negate good conduct, bad conduct and	1
other worlds [i.e. subsequent rebirths] believing that there is no good conduct, there is	1
no bad conduct and there are no other worlds.260	1
[6] There is the imputation of efficacy due to imagining that ignorance	1
etc. is instrumental in the production of the formative forces etc. If it is	1
imagined that in the production of the formative forces etc. ignorance etc. can cause the	1
nature of an entity to become something other261, then there is imputation of efficacy.	1
[7] There is the negation of efficacy due to imagining that [the latter]	1
are devoid of power. There is the negation of efficacy due to imagining that the	1
formative forces are devoid of power although they have the capacity for origination	1
through the mere [imputation of the] existence of ignorance etc.	1
[8] The absence of both imputation and negation should be understood	1
as being due to the non-existence of these [conditions]. The absence of	1
imputation and negation should be understood as being due to the absence of that	1
imputation and negation in regard to cause, result and efficacy 262. Thus, whether [this	1
belief relates] to a self separately 263 from ignorance etc. or to something else, this skill	1
in dependent origination should be understood as the counteragent to the adherence to	1
the belief in an agent. For, there is no self nor anything else in this regard, apart from	1

Impossible.	1
The next [is considered] in the sense	1
of an other-dependence in relation to:	1
(a) what is not desired, (b) what is	1
desired, (c) purity, (d) concurrent	1
births, (e) sovereignty, (f) complete	1
attainment and (g) behaviour.	1
The possible and the impossible should be understood in the sense	1
of a sevenfold dependence upon something other. Of these, (a) there is	1
dependence upon something other in relation to what is not desired due	1
to falling into wretched states of existence, although not desiring it, on	1
account of bad conduct. (b) There is dependence upon something other	1
in relation to what is desired due to the attainment of propitious states	0
of existence on account of good conduct. (c) There is dependence upon	1
something other in relation to purity because of not bringing suffering	1
to an end by not relinquishing the five hindrances and so on up until	1
not having cultivated the seven limbs of enlightenment. (d) There is	1
dependence upon something other in relation to concurrent births of the	1
two existing simultaneously, i.e. of two tathāgatas or two cakravartins,	1
since they cannot be born into the one world sphere. (e) There is	1
dependence upon something other in relation to sovereignty since	1
women cannot become cakravartins etc. (f) There is dependence upon	1
something other in relation to complete attainment since a woman can-	1
not become perfectly enlightened, whether it be individual enlight-	1
enment or supreme enlightenment. (g) There is dependence upon	1
something other in relation to behaviour because one endowed with	1
[sound] views does not engage in [violent]264 behaviour, such as	1

[Sthiramati]	1
Y150.7 [1] The meaning of the possible and the impossible should be mentioned immediately	1
following the meaning of dependent origination, hence he says:	1

[The next (is considered) in the	1
sense of an other-dependence in	1
regard to]: (a) what is not desired,	1
(b) what is desired, (c) purity etc.266	1
The possible and the impossible should be understood in the sense of a	1
"sevenfold dependence upon something other. In the above ""possible"" is"	1
"[equivalent to] 'cause'. ""Iimpossible"" is [equivalent to] 'absence of cause'. As has been"	1
stated in this verse [from Dhammapada, 223]:	1
One ought speak the truth and not be angry;	1
one ought give to a beggar even from a	1
little267. Through these three proprieties	0
here in this world one ought proceed to the	1
presence of the gods.	1
It is understood that [proprieties (sthāna)] are [equivalent to] causes. Alternatively,	1
propriety (sthana) is (equivalent to] possibility (sambhava) and impropriety (asthāna)	1
is [equivalent to] impossibility (asambhava). The skill in these is [equivalent to] skill	1
"in the possible and the impossible. ""Dependence upon something other"" (päratantrya)"	1
is the state (bhäva) of being dependent upon something other (paratantrasya); what is	1
meant is: resting upon something other (parāyattatā). Although this is sevenfold it is	1
included within the three other-dependencies of karma, defilement and rebirth.	1
[2] Of these, there is dependence upon something other in relation to	1
what is not desired...; what is not desired refers to the wretched states of exis-	1
tence. In order to demonstrate that the attainment of these [states of existence] rests	1
upon bad conduct268 and is a dependence upon something other, he says: ...due to	1
falling into wretched states of existence, although not desiring it269, on	1
account of bad conduct, including actions of body speech and mind, such as the	1
taking of a life, together with their preparation and consequences. The wretched states	1

Ms.(18a.3): -ănicchädito, but Y's emendation to -ânicchato is correct; cf. Bhaşya N46.11.	1
of existence refers to the hells, the Pretas and animals270. Because of the extreme	0
suffering271 in these [states], there is no desire on the part of anyone to attain rebirth	1
there. Since actions are powerful and are the cause of wretched states of existence, on	1
account of the power of actions alone, one whose conduct is bad attains rebirth in such	1
places although not desiring it.	1
[3] There is dependence upon something other in relation to what is	1
desired due to the attainment of propitious states of existence on	1
account of good conduct; what is desired refers to the attainment of the propitious	1
states of existence. The propitious states of existence are those of the gods and	1
mankind. Good conduct consists in: (a) abstention from the taking of life etc. together	1
with the preparation and consequences of the latter, (b) acts of generosity, respect and	1
honour etc. towards teachers, preceptors and those who possess virtue etc. and (c) the	1
special virtues of love and compassion and the like. There is dependence on something	1
other since rebirth in the propitious states of existence is dependent upon good conduct	1
alone, for even those who seek it do not attain a propitious state of existence in any	1
other way apart from [the practice of] good conduct.	1
[4] There is dependence upon something other in relation to purity...;	1
purity refers to the relinquishment of moral defilement272. ...[by not relinquish-	1
ing] the five hindrances, i.e.: (a) the desire for sensual pleasure, (b) malice, (c)	1
torpor and drowsiness, (d) excitability and remorse and (e) doubt; they are five after	1
combining torpor and drowsiness as one, and similarly, excitability and remorse. Non-	1
specifically, they are hindrances (nivaraṇāni) since they hinder (nivṛṇvanu) the whole-	1
some side. Specifically, they are hindrances since they respectively conceal: (a) the joy	1
of setting forth273 [from the household life], (b) correct spiritual practice for one who is	1
inspired in the right way by fellow brahmacarins towards the actions of body and	1
speech that conform to that [correct spiritual practice], (c) the absence of fainthearted-	0
ness at the time of meditative calm, (d) the absence of distraction at the time of exertion	1
and (e) the state of spontaneity at the time of meditative calm and penetrating insight.	1

power, the faculties and the powers are also included. ...Because of not bringing	0
suffering to an end. The end of suffering refers to that [state] where suffering is	0
non-existent and this is nirväņa277. That this is not brought about is [equivalent to] its	1
non-attainment; what is meant is: one does not attain nirvāṇa. Alternatively, the end of	1
suffering refers to the fact that one does not create the suffering pertinent to rebirth, for	1
one does not create such278 suffering as that from which other suffering is entailed.	1
The dependence upon something other in regard to purity refers to the fact that it is	1
subject to the relinquishment of the five hindrances.279	1
[5] There is dependence upon something other in relation to concurrent	1
births of two tathāgatas or cakravartins280, existing simultaneously. What is	1
meant is: both together; ...i.e. of two tathāgatas or two cakravartins, since	1
they cannot be born into the one world sphere. Some schools believe that	1
with regard to the two tathāgatas, the world-sphere of 3,000 million worlds is meant;	1
however, [the world-sphere that consists in the four continents [is meant] in regard to	1
the two cakravartins. Others believe that the world consisting in the four continents [is	1
meant] in regard to the two tathāgatas as well.281 For the Buddhas, the Venerable	1
Ones, display their perfect enlightenment and parinirvāṇa in the world-sphere of 3,000	1
million worlds through the influence of the Dharma Body, in each world consisting in	1
four continents, by means of the Transformation Body282. For thus, the aim of the	1
bodhisattvas, i.e. the possession of death and rebirth283 in one of the worlds that con-	1
sist in the four great284 continents in the Tuşita realms or among mankind 285, is the	1
same in regard to the other worlds that consist in the four continents. Therefore, they	1
believe that the Venerable One, who was perfectly enlightened already in the Akaniştha	1
realm, displays by means of the Transformation Body: (a) his birth and passing away	1
in all of the worlds consisting in the four continents which are included in the [world-	1
sphere of 286 3,000 million worlds and in the Tuşita realms and (b) everything such as	1
the possession of rebirth among mankind. In this respect the dependency on some-	0
thing other in regard to concurrent existences refers to the fact that the birth of a	1
Buddha and a cakravartin depends on unequal productive karma287.	1

"""Attainment"" refers to the realization of: (a) Buddhahood or (b) pratyekabuddha-hood."	1
The dependence on something other in this context refers to its attainment by a man	1
and its non-attainment by a woman292, because, like a rhinoceros [i.e. a pratyeka-	1
buddha], [a woman] is not suited to: (a) become a teacher in the three realms and (b)	1

not relinquish these [moral defilements]. Furthermore, they do not relinquish the latter	0
due to the fact that the path which [acts] as the counteragent to them has not arisen.	1
[9] Thus, the skill in the possible and the impossible is associated with a dependence	1
upon something other in relation to what is not desired etc. and is the counteragent to	1
the adherence to the belief in the independence of the purușa and the iśvara etc. For, if	1
there were no dependency whatsover, [people] should not fall into wretched states of	1
existence on account of bad conduct. It should be stated similarly in regard to the other	1
cases as well.	1
f. The Meaning of the Faculties.	1
There are twenty-two kinds of faculties:	1
III.20 ab	0
[These are considered] as being for	1
the purpose of: (a) perception, (b) du-	1
ration, (c) continuity, (d) experience	1
and (e) the two purities.	1
[They are considered] as being for the purpose of [the five begin-	1
ning with perception and concluding with the two purities, since they	1
exercise a dominant influence in regard to these [five]. For, (a) there is	1
the dominant influence of the six beginning with sight in relation to the	1
perception of sense-objects of form etc. (b) [There is the dominant	1
influence of the vital faculty in relation to duration since death does	1
not occur on account of its dominant influence. (c) [There is the domi-	1
nant influence] of the female and male faculties in relation to the	1
continuation of the family because these [faculties] exercise a dominant	1
influence in the procreation of offspring. (d) [There is the dominant	1
influence] of the faculties of sensation in relation to experience since	1
one experiences the result of wholesome and unwholesome action. And	1
(e) [there is the dominant influence] of faith etc. in relation to mundane	1
purity; [there is the dominant influence] of the faculty of understanding	1
what has not been understood etc. in relation to supramundane purity.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Since the meaning of the faculties should be mentioned immediately following the	1
explanation of the meaning of the possible and the impossible, he says: there are	1
twenty-two kinds of faculties, i.e. beginning with the faculty of sight and204	1
concluding with the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge. Moreover, in this	1
"context ""faculty"" (indriya) has the sense of 'dominant influence' (adhipatya). As to"	1
which has dominant influence where, he says:	1
III.20 ab	0
[These are considered] as being for	1
the purpose of: (a) perception, (b) du-	1
ration, (c) continuity, (d) experience	1
and (e) the two purities. 297	1
"In this [verse] the word ""dominant influence"" is to be understood as having been"	1
"omitted for metrical reasons; properly298 [it should read]: ""as being for the purpose of"	1
"exercising a dominant influence upon: ...(e) the two [purities]"". Therefore, the author"	1
of the commentary says: since they exercise a dominant influence in regard	1
"to these [five]. The expression: ""for the purpose of"" (artha) in the statement: ""for"	1
"the purpose of perception"", signifies 'aim' (prayojana). He shows that the faculty"	1
therein is for the purpose of perception 299. The same should be stated, respectively, in	1
"other cases as well. ""in regard to these"" [means] in regard to the perception of the"	1
object etc. It is a dominant influence since it is a superior power; what is meant is: the	0
dominant influence is [equivalent to; causality.	1
[2] The sense-objects of form etc. are those beginning with form and concluding	1
with the non-sensible. The perception of the latter consists in sight-consciousness	1
etc. In relation to these, there is the dominant influence of the six beginning	0
with sight. It is described as a faculty since it is a superior power over colour etc.300	1
because sight is the basis for the consciousness which differentiates form/colour (rūpa)	1
without exception. However, the colour blue cannot be the objective support for the	1
consciousness of the colour yellow etc.- 301 In detail, the same should be stated, respec-	1
tively, with regard to hearing etc.	1
[3] [There is the dominant influence] of the vital faculty in relation to	1
duration. The vital faculty, which is pierced by the latent impressions of previous	1
karma302 when there is no interrupting condition in the karma result continuum,	1
consists in the capacity for rebirth in each subsequent moment which corresponds to	0
each preceding moment. Here now he gives the reason for the fact that there is the	1

basis of the Tib.; cf. his fn.5 p.154.Y155	1
dominant influence of the vital faculty with regard to duration303: since death does	0
not occur on account of its dominant influence. The absence of death is	1
[equivalent to the continuance of the homogeneous groups projected by previous	0
karma. Food and the like are not faculties even though they are instrumental in the	1
maintenance of life because, in spite of their presence, there is no continued existence	1
when life is extinguished and also, because in the realm of form and the formless	1
realm, the presence of continued existence is due only to the vital faculty, even though	1
there is no bodily nutriment. Moreover, in this case the dominant influence of contact	1
etc. in relation to continued existence is not tenable because the maintenance of sentient	1
beings in the conditions of the attainment of cessation and non-consciousness and also	1
in [induced] non-consciousness is possible, even though contact etc. is absent.	1
[4] [There is the dominant influence] of the female and male faculties in	1
relation to the continuation of the family304. Since there is no break in the	1
continuation of the family when a son is born the continuation of the family refers to	1
the birth of a son. Now, in order to demonstrate this, he says: because of their	1
dominant influence in procreation. A certain part of the faculty of touch	0
"receives the title: ""female"" or ""male faculty"" because it exerts a particular dominant"	1
influence. Where there is the establishment of the family, there is the presence of the	1
female faculty and the male faculty and by virtue of these there is no break in the conti-	1
nuity of the family. Moreover, the family is established among the gods dwelling in	1
[the realm of] form if the female faculty and the male faculty are present, but not if they	1
are not present. For, there is no dominant influence in this respect on the part of	1
gandharvas etc. because there is no capacity for the procreation of sons on the part of	1
eunuchs etc. who have no female or male faculties305, even if the gandharvas etc. are	1
present306. Furthermore, food and the like are not faculties because they are not enu-	1
merated among animate things although they are dominant influences [of sorts].	1
[5] [There is the dominant influence] of the faculties of sensation in	1
relation to experience; the fact that this is a dominant influence is understood.	1
How so? Hence he says: because one experiences the result of wholesome	1
and unwholesome action. The faculties of sensation are five: pleasure, pain,	1
gladness, sadness and equanimity. It is [through the dominant influence] of these that	1
one experiences the result of wholesome and unwholesome karma because they have	1
the nature of experience, but name / form (nămarūpa) have no dominant influence over	1
them because they are [only] the ground for sensation. And the state of having them	1

[i.e. nämarūpal as the ground refers to sensation because of the predominance of the	1
karma-result.	1
[6] Mundane purity refers to the relinquishment of the mundane moral defilement.	1
In regard to this (there is the dominant influence] of faith etc., i.e. of the five	1
faculties of faith, vigour, mindfulness, meditative concentration and wisdom; that these	1
are dominant influences remains in force because they are characterized by the mun-	1
dane path since they are the counteragents to lack of faith etc. Others believe that it is	1
because they are characterized by [the elements] that are conducive to liberation.	1
[7] [There is the dominant influence] of the faculty of understanding	1
what has not been understood etc. in relation to supramundane purity.	1
The fact that this is a dominant influence remains in force. Supramundane purity refers	1
to the relinquishment of moral defilement by means of the supramundane path. In	1
relation to this, there is the dominant influence of three: (a) the faculty of understanding	1
what has not been understood, (b) the faculty of understanding and (c) the faculty of	1
the possession of perfect knowledge, for these three are respectively incorporated in	1
the paths of: (a) vision, (b) meditative development and (c) the adept. Therein, with	1
reference to which is appropriate according to their differences in being based on the	0
preliminary stage [of the first dhyana]³07 etc., these nine faculties, i.e. the five begin-	1
ning with faith as well as mind, happiness, gladness and equanimity, are called: (a) the	1
faculty of understanding what has not been understood, on the path of vision, (b) the	1
faculty of understanding, on the path of meditative development and (c) the faculty of	1
the possession of perfect knowledge308, on the path of the adept.	1
[8] However, this arrangement is different for the yogäcāra the faculty of under-	1
standing what has not been understood and the faculty of understanding comprise ten	1
faculties, i.e., there are ten after adding 'sadness' to the nine mentioned above. How-	1
ever, the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge 309 comprises only nine. In	1
this regard, on the path of preparation which consists in the aids to insight³10, and on	1
the fifteen moments of the path of vision, there is the faculty of mind and the five	1
beginning with faith and any one of the faculties of happiness, gladness, sadness and	0
equanimity3 311, as is appropriate according to their differences in being based on the	1
preliminary stage [of the first dhyāna] etc. Furthermore, the faculty of sadness³12	1
should be understood as being included because of the longing for supreme deliver-	0
ance that follows after the aids to insight, at the time of preparation. These tenfold	1
faculties, according to which is appropriate, are described as the faculty of under-	1

standing what has not been understood since they manifest in order to understand a	0
reality that was not previously313 understood. The same ten kinds of faculties are	1
described as comprising the faculty of understanding on this the path of one who is	1
still in training, i.e. extending from the sixteen moments of the path of vision up until	1
the vajra-like meditative concentration, because there is nothing to be known that was	1
not previously known. On the path of the adept, the remaining [faculties] with the	1
exception of the faculty of sadness receive the title [collectively]: 'the faculty of the	1
possession of perfect knowledge'. Since it is the faculty pertinent to one who	1
possesses perfect knowledge it is [described as] the faculty of the possession of perfect	1
knowledge³¹4. In this way the adherence to the belief in a dominant influence in regard	1
to the purușa, the nārāyaṇa or the iśvara is checked for one who is skilled in the facul-	1

The cause therein refers to the cause of rebirth; the result is that which is incorporated	1
in the rebirth. The experience of the cause is the imparting of the result; the experience	1
of the result is the expiration of what has been experienced. And since such a cause	1
and its result pertain to the past, he says: the past time [should be known] in	1
the sense of the experience of the result and cause317. The future time	1
[should be known] in the sense of the non-experience of the result and	1
cause318 in that same mode. Furthermore, the present319 time, i.e. the present	0
rebirth, should be known in the sense of the experience of the cause,	1
because the cause has produced a result; and in the sense of the non-experience	1
of the result, because this result follows the present rebirth. The determination of	1
the times should be understood as referring to momentariness, for the existing entities,	1
at every instant, possess the nature of cause and result³20. Therein, the experience of	1
the cause is due to the production of its own result. The experience of the result is due	1
to the destruction of the effect³21 immediately following its birth. Thus the subject	1
under discussion is the fact that the past time [should be understood] in the sense of the	1
experience of the result and the cause; the future time [should be understood] in the	1
sense of the non-experience of the result and the cause. The non-experience of the	1
result and its cause should be known as being due to: (a) the non-production³22 of the	1
effect and (b) the absence of the destruction of what has not come into being. The	1
statement: [the present time should be understood] in the sense of the experience of the	0
cause and the non-experience of the result [means]: (a) the experience of the cause is	1
due to the production of the effect and (b) the non-experience of the result is due to the	1
non-destruction of the effect. In this way, the adherence to the belief in the self as	1
something permanent is checked for one who is skillful in the times because he does	1
not perceive anything other apart from the times323.	1

should be known as the dharmas that pertain to sensation. The truth of	1
origination [is considered in the sense of the practice caused by that,	0
i.e. the practice caused by the truth324 of suffering. The truth of cessa-	1
tion [is considered] in the sense of the appeasement of the [first two.	1
The truth of the path [is considered] in the sense of the counteragent.	1

(The next is considered] in the sense	1
of: (a) sensation together with its	1

It is generally known that sensation has the sense of suffering; also, according to this	1
"statement from a treatise327; ""whatever sensation is, in this context it [has the charac-"	1
"teristic] of suffering"". With regard to the respective determination of the [four] truths,"	1
all sensation together with its cause, be it pleasurable and accompanied by impurity,	0
painful, or neither pleasurable nor painful, means the truth of suffering; in order to	1
demonstrate this the author of the commentary says: of these, the truth of	1
suffering [is considered] in the sense of sensation together with its	1
cause. Why is it that all sensation is [equivalent to] suffering? He says: consider-	1
"ing that³28 [it is said]: ""whatever sensation is, in this context it [has the"	1
"characteristic of suffering"". These sensations are [equivalent to] suffering since"	1
they have the nature of: (a) the suffering of suffering, (b) the suffering of change and	1
(c) the suffering of the formative forces, respectively. Alternatively, [sensation is	1
equivalent to] suffering on account of just the fact that it has the nature of the suffering	1
of the formative forces. Furthermore, the cause of sensation should be	1
known as the dharmas that pertain to sensation. The dharmas that pertain to	1

sensation are those consisting in the sensations of pleasure, pain, and neither pleasure	0
nor pain. In this way the five aggregates are explained as the truth of suffering.	1
[2] The truth of origination [is considered in the sense of the practice	1
"caused by the latter³29. The truth of suffering is referred to by ""the latter"". That"	1
practice on account of which suffering is brought into being consists in the truth of	1
origination. Moreover, the latter, which has the activities of body, speech and mind for	0
its essential nature, is preceded by the cause of the craving for sensation and the	1
dharmas that pertain to sensation. In brief, it has been said that the truth330 of origina-	1
tion consists in the karma331 that is the source of becoming.	1
[3] The truth of cessation [is considered] in the sense of the appease-	1
ment of the [first] two. The [first] two are the truths of suffering and of origina-	1
"tion. The words: ""in the sense of the appeasement..."" ""332 are [equivalent to] 'in the"	1
sense of the non-production.... Thus, since it is characterized by the non-origination of	1
suffering together with its causes, cessation is described as being twofold: (a) as	1
possessing a remaining substratum in the sense of the appeasement of origination and	1
(b) as not possessing a remaining substratum in the sense of the appeasement of	1
suffering.	1
[4] The truth of the path..., i.e. the way leading to the cessation of both suffering	1
and its origination [is considered] in the sense of the counteragent to these	1
same two which have been referred to, i.e. suffering and its origination. In this way,	1
since one who is skillful in the truths has an understanding of defilement and purifica-	1
tion alone, his adherence to the belief in defilement and purification other than this is	1
checked because [he understands that] it does not exist.	1

does not often distinguish between sa, șa and sa.Y160	1
[The next are the three vehicles, respectively. Of these, the śrāvaka	1
vehicle [should be known] because one goes forth [as a mendicant],	1
having learnt from others through the knowledge of the virtues and	1
faults of airvāpa and samsāra. The pratyekabuddha vehicle [should be	1
known] because one goes forth on one's own, without having learnt	1
from others, through that same [knowledge]. The universal vehicle	1
should be known because one goes forth on one's own through direct	1
intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y159.15 [1] The meaning of the three vehicles is illustrated immediately following the meaning	1
of the truths, hence he says:	1
III.22 ab-	0
...Through [the knowledge] of	1
virtues and faults and [direct intu-	1
ition] devoid of conceptual differen-	1
tiation³33 etc.	1
"The word ""knowledge"" is understood with both, i.e. (a) as the knowledge of virtues"	1
and faults and (b) as the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation. Alterna-	1
tively, the words '[knowledge that consists in conceptual differentiation can be	1
regarded as having been omitted from (a). It should be mentioned that in (a) above [the	1
"word ""knowledge"" has the sense of] the knowledge of virtues and faults after distin-"	1
guishing it as [being learnt] from others or on one's own. Since that which is devoid	1
of conceptual differentiation is only learnt by oneself, in the commentary he says:	1
respectively. Of these, ...through the knowledge of the virtues and	0
"faults of nirväņa and samsāra. The word ""nirvāņa"" in this context includes"	1
"both the path and cessation, as does the word ""tranquillity"". Therein, the knowledge of"	1
virtue in relation to nirvana refers to knowledge that is: (a) in the aspects of tranquillity	1
etc. 334 in regard to cessation and (b) in the aspects of definitive liberation etc. in regard	1
to the path 335. Although samsāra has the nature of both suffering and its origination,	1
therein, the knowledge of faults in relation to samsāra refers to knowledge that is: (a)	1
in the aspects of impermanence and suffering etc. and (b) in the aspects of origination	1
and causal conditions etc. Having learnt from others...; i.e. having learnt of the	1
virtues and faults of nirvana and samsăra, as have been described 336 from the Buddhas	1
and bodhisattvas etc.. Because one goes forth [as a mendicant]...; i.e. because	1
one departs from samsāra, the śrävaka vehicle [should be known]; i.e. because	1

"one goes forth relying on the utterances of others. By the term ""śrāvaka vehicle"", he"	0
shows that it is distinct from the pratyekabuddha vehicle.	1
[2] Through that same knowledge of the virtues and faults of nirvāṇa and samsāra	1
because one goes forth on one's own, not having learnt 337 from	0
others 338, i.e. from the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, the pratyekabuddha vehicle	1
"[should be known]. By the words: ""on one's own, not having learnt from"	0
"others ""339, [he shows that] it is distinct from the śrävaka vehicle."	1
[3] Through direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation...; direct	1
intuition is devoid of conceptual differentiation because it penetrates the ineffable real	1
nature of samsāra and nirvana; the universal vehicle should be known	1
because one goes forth just on one's own without having learnt from others. In	1
"this context, the term ""direct intuition"" distinguishes this from the pratyekabuddha"	1
vehicle.	1
[4] However, others believe: (a) the śrävaka vehicle is [described as] a going forth	1
through the direct intuition which has the insubstantiality of the personal entity for its	1
object and consists in an absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to virtues and	1
faults, after having learnt from others, (b) the pratyekabuddha vehicle [is described as]	1
a going forth on one's own without dependence upon³40 learning [from others) and (c)	1
the universal vehicle is described as a going forth on one's own through direct intuition	1
which is devoid of conceptual differentiation, having the insubstantiality of the	1
dharmas for its object and leading to the nirvāṇa [in which the bodhisattva is] not per-	1
manently fixed. However this explanation³41 is contradicted by the commentary.	1
In this way the adherence to the belief that the self is a yogi is checked for one who	1
possesses skill in the three vehicles due to the observation that there is just yoga.	1

and cause and (b)	0
together with its object.	0
tranquillity	0
[The final topic] refers to the conditioned and the unconditioned.	1
"The words: ""in accompaniment with its designation"" in this [verse]"	1
"refer to the name-group etc. The ""cause"" refers to that in which the"	1
"'seeds' are incorporated, i.e. the store-consciousness. The ""causal-sign"""	1
refers to that in which the support, the body and experience are incor-	1
porated. Those [elements] that are incorporated in the actual	1
consciousnesses are: (a) mind, (b) apprehending and (c) conceptual	1
differentiation. This the causal-sign, in accompaniment with both its	0
designation and cause together with its associated elements, is to be	1
"known as the conditioned. Therein, ""mind"" refers to the aspect of"	1
"mental activity that is eternal; ""apprehending"" refers to the five groups"	1
"of consciousness; ""conceptual differentiation"" refers to the mind-con-"	1
sciousness because it is this that conceptually differentiates.	1
The unconditioned refers to: (a) cessation which is [equivalent to]	1
tranquillity and (b) the object of tranquillity, i.e. thusness. [Therein,	1
tranquillity refers to both cessation and the path, considering that the	1
former [i.e. cessation] consists in tranquillity and tranquillity is on	1
account of the latter [i.e. the path]. Thusness is the object of tran-	1
quillity (prašamārtha), considering that it is the object of tranquillity	1
(praśamasya artha)]342 because thusness is the objective support of the	1
path. Tranquillity belongs to the path because tranquilization [occurs]	1
on account of it.	1
Thus, it is in these meanings that the knowledge in regard to the	1
aggregates etc. should be known as the skill in the aggregates etc.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y160.23 [1] Now, in order to clearly illustrate the meaning of the conditioned and the uncondi-	1
tioned, he says:	1
III.22 def	0

The final [topic] is declared as being	1
due to: (a) the causal-sign in accom-	1
paniment with both its designation	1
and cause and (b) tranquillity	1
together with its object.343	0
The passage marked by parenthesis (N48.15-17) is not found in the Tib. Bhasya (cf. D15a.7)	1
although portions of it are glossed by the Tika; cf. Nagao's fn.7 p.48.	1

saprajnaptisahetukam /	1
nimittam praśamaḥ sarthaḥ pašcad eva prakasitam // Cf. Bhäşya N48.6.214	1
What is this that is listed as the final [topic]? He says: it refers to the conditioned	1
and the unconditioned because this was listed at the very end. Therein, the condi-	1
tioned is determined as being due to the causal-sign in accompaniment with its desig-	1
nation and cause; whereas, the unconditioned is determined as being due to tranquillity	1
together with its object. Moreover, in order to clearly illustrate the designation, cause	1
"and causal-sign since they are not known, he says: The words: ""in accompani-"	1
"ment with its designation""344 refer to the name-group etc."	1
The name-group	1
and sentence-group consist in the designation since the own-being and particular of	1
things are designated through the name-groups and sentence groups 345; but the sylla-	1
ble-group consists in the designation because it causes the manifestation of the latter	1
"two. The ""cause"" refers to that in which the 'seeds' are incorporated, i.e."	1
the store-consciousness. The latter, which is endowed with the latent	1
impressions of all impure dharmas and is not the imparted result, is incorporated in the	1
truth of origination. Consequently, in order to distinguish this from the imparted	1
"result, he says: ""that in which the 'seeds' are incorporated"". The ""causal-sign"""	1
refers to that in which the support, the body346 and experience are	1
incorporated. 347 It is the store-consciousness that is referred to. The [elements]	1
incorporated in the actual consciousnesses are: (a) mind, (b) appre-	1
"hending and (c) conceptual differentiation348. The ""support"" in the above"	1
refers to the inanimate world, i.e. the store-consciousness in the appearance of the	1
latter. It is incorporated 349 as the support since it is incorporated in its nature as the	1
"support. The ""body""350 refers to the physical body together with the faculties, i.e. the"	1
store-consciousness in the appearance of the latter. It is that in which the body is	1
incorporated; what is meant is: it possesses the body for its nature. It is that in which	1
experience is incorporated this has already been described in the above. It consists in	1
experience³51 since the other consciousnesses experience these two [i.e. the body and	1
experience] as being the dominant entities352. Alternatively, it is experience (bhoga)	1
since food and drink and the like are experienced (bhujyate). That within which expe-	1
rience is incorporated is the [store]-consciousness in the appearance as the latter. This	1
the causal-sign, in accompaniment with both its designation and cause	0
together with its associated elements, is to be known as the conditioned	1

because these clearly indicate the own-being and particular of that [causal-sign] and	1
since it is in conformity with these [i.e. the name-group etc.], the causal-sign belongs to	1
the [elements] called mind, apprehending and conceptual differentiation, i.e. the mind	1

tualization (samjñā) because of the statement356 that it has the nature of the apprehen-	1
sion of the sign. The store-consciousness which incorporates the support, the body	1
and experience is the causal-sign of the foundation because there is the nourishment of	1
the latent impressions [therein]. Mind, apprehending and conceptual differentiation are	1
also the causal-sign of the objective support because they create the objective support-	1
sign³57; and since it creates the sign in both cases, the causal-sign belongs to both the	1
objective support and the supporter358.	1
"[3] Therein, ""mind"" refers to the aspect of mental activity 359 that is eter-"	1
nal; that which eternally thinks (manyate) in terms of 'me' and 'mine' is described as	1
mind (manas). It is associated with: (a) delusion regarding the self, false view of the	1
self, affection for the self and self-conceit and (b) the five all-pervading (dharmas], i.e.	1
"sensation, conceptualization, volition, contact and mental attention. ""Apprehending"""	1
refers to the five groups of consciousness because they have the characteristic	1
of 'seizing the essential nature of the sense-object. Since the latter are to be understood	1
"intuitively and cannot be stated, they are described as 'apprehending'. ""Conceptual"	1
"differentiation"" refers to mind-consciousness because it is this which"	1
conceptually differentiates 360 the characteristic of the dharmas as individual or	1
universal. All361 of these, the causal-sign in accompaniment with its designation and	1

[4] The unconditioned refers to: (a) cessation which is [equivalent to]	1
tranquillity and (b) that which is the object of tranquillity, i.e. thusness.	1
It is appropriate that cessation has tranquillity for its essential nature because it is char-	1
acterized by the appeasement of suffering together with its causes. Why is thusness	1
described as the object of tranquillity? Considering that it is the object of	1
tranquillity. If thusness362 has no connection whatsoever with cessation, how can it	1
be the object of tranquillity? Because thusness is the objective support of the	1
path. How is it that tranquillity belongs to the path? Because tran-	1
quilization363 [occurs] on account of it. Nirvāṇa is [equivalent to tranquillity	1
because it consists in tranquillity, and since tranquilization364 [occurs] on account of	1
this [i.e. the path], tranquillity refers to ...the path. Thus, from analysing365 the	1
resolution of the compound (i.e. praśamārtha) [it is evident that] both nirvāṇa and the	1
"path are referred to through the single expression ""tranquillity"". But does the truth of"	1
the path consist in the conditioned or the unconditioned? It consists in the conditioned	1
because it is to be produced 366. If one were to say that it consists in the unconditioned	1
because: (a) it is not brought about through karma and moral defilement and (b) it is	0
characterized by the unconditioned, there would be no fault in this. Thus it is in	1
these meanings that the knowledge in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
should be known as the skill in the aggregates etc.	1

The Summary Meaning of Reality.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
The summary meaning of reality. In brief, reality is twofold: (a)	1
mirror reality and (b) visible reality. Mirror reality in this regard is	1
[equivalent to] basic reality because the others are visible therein.	1
Visible reality is ninefold: (a) the visible reality free from illusory	1
notions; (b) the visible reality free from erroneous inversion367; (c) the	1
visible reality of going forth by means of the śrävaka vehicle; (d) the	1
visible reality of going forth by means of the universal vehicle because	1
it brings about maturity by way of the gross and liberates by way of the	1
subtle; (e) the visible reality of the refutation of opponents because they	0
are refuted through reasoning based upon example; (f) the visible real-	1
ity of the lucid explanation of the universal vehicle; (g) the visible real-	1
ity of entry into the knowable in all aspects; (h) the visible reality of	1
the lucid explanation of true thusness and (i) the visible reality of	1
entry368 into all intended meanings in regard to the foundation for the	0
adherence to the belief in the self.	1
Y163.15 The summary meaning of reality369. In brief, reality is twofold 370; in	1
As to	0
detail, it has been described as tenfold. Hence in brief, it is twofold371: (a) mirror	1
reality and (b) visible reality. Mirror reality in this regard is	1
[equivalent to] basic reality; moreover, this consists in the three natures.	1
"why it is described as ""mirror reality"" because the others, i.e. the reality of charac-"	0
teristic etc., are visible therein372. Visible reality which was explained pre-	1
viously as the reality of characteristic etc. is ninefold. Why is it described as visible	1
reality? Because it is visible within basic reality. (a) The visible reality free	1
from illusory notions; i.e. the reality of characteristic, for the freedom from	1
illusory notions [comes about] on account of this because there is neither imputation	1
nor negation in regard to: (a) the personal entity and the dharmas, (b) the apprehended	1
object and apprehending subject and (c) existence and non-existence. (b) The visi-	1
ble reality free from erroneous inversion 373; i.e. that which is characterized by	1

the absence of erroneous inversion, for this is the counteragent to erroneous inver-	0
sion374 such as the notion of permanence. (c) The visible reality of going forth	1
by means of the śrävaka vehicle; i.e. the reality of cause and result. The going	1
forth of the śrävaka is via meditative development and the penetration of the four noble	1
truths. (d) The visible reality of going forth by means of the universal	1
vehicle; i.e. the reality of the gross and the subtle. One goes forth via the universal	1
vehicle because it brings beings to maturity by way of the gross, i.e. by way	1
of conventional truth, and because it liberates them by way of the subtle, i.e.	1
by way of ultimate truth375. (e) The visible reality of the refutation of oppo-	1
nents, i.e. well established reality. How so? He says: because they are refuted	1
through reasoning based upon example 376; examples are generally accepted	1
when refuting an opponent. It is reasoning since it is based on words 377 that are well	1
established through reasoning. (f) The visible reality of the lucid explanation	1
of the universal vehicle; i.e. the reality of the sphere of pure direct intuition, for	1
this refers to the sphere of the pure direct intuition378 of both obscuration that consists	1
in moral defilement and the knowable 379 and comprises the lucid explanations of other	1
scriptural traditions this is the versal vehicle. (g) The visible reality of	1
entry into the knowable in all its aspects; i.e. the reality of inclusion. More-	0
over, this refers to the five categories because with reference to them, one enters into all	1
that is knowable. (h) The visible reality of the lucid explanation of true	0
thusness380; i.e. the reality of differentiation, for the lucid explanation of both the true	1
thusness and the unaltered thusness of things is on account of this. (i) The visible	1
reality of entry by way of all intended meanings 381 in regard to the	0
foundation for the adherence to the belief in the self; i.e. the reality of the	1
skills, for, on account of this [the bodhisattval enters by way of all interpretations in	0

[Sthiramati]	1
[1] The Meditative Development of the Counteragent, as well as the State Therein and	1
the Attainment of the Result should be mentioned immediately following the exposition	1
of Reality, hence the Fourth Chapter is undertaken in order to clearly illustrate these	1
[subjects]. The State Therein and the Attainment of the Result are stated because: (a)	1
they were [initially] listed immediately after¹ Reality and (b) they are subject to the	1
Meditative Development of the Counteragent.	1
1. The Meditative Development of the	1
Counteragent.	1
Introductory.	0
The meditative development of the counteragent which is [equivalent	1
to] the meditative development of the factors that contribute to enlight-	1
enment should now be mentioned.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] In order to demonstrate that in a Sūtra, the factors which contribute to enlighten-	1
ment are asserted as being counteragents, he says: the meditative development of	1
the counteragent which is [equivalent to] the meditative development of	1
the factors that contribute to enlightenment2... For they are described as	0
counteragents since they gain strength while being cultivated for the relinquishment of	1
adverse obscuration as described [in Chapter II]. Furthermore, they number thirty-	1
seven, [beginning with] the four applications of mindfulness up until the noble eight-	1
limbed path. The meditative development of these is synonymous with: (a) their	1
promotion, (b) their generation, (c) their practice and (d) their repetition³. [These]	1
should now be mentioned because they were listed immediately after Reality.	1

a. The Four Applications of Mindfulness.	1
Now, in regard to these, at the beginning:	1
IV.1 abcd	0
The meditative development of the	1
applications of mindfulness leads to	1
the comprehension of the four truths	1
and is due to: (a) disquiet, (b) the	0
cause of craving, (c) the foundation	1
[of the latter] and (d) the absence of	1
confusion.	1
(a) Disquiet is made manifest through the body; one comprehends	1
the truth of suffering through the investigation of the latter because [the	1
body] is characterized by the formative forces together with disquiet;	1
for, disquiet consists in the painful nature of the formative forces	1
account of this the Noble Ones regard all impure entities in terms of	0
suffering. (b) The cause of craving is sensation; through the investiga-	1
tion of this, one comprehends the truth of origination. (c) Mind is the	1
foundation for the notional attachment to the self; through the inves-	1
tigation of this, one comprehends the truth of cessation due to the	1
removal of the fear of self-annihilation. (d) Through the investigation	1
of the dharmas one comprehends the truth of the path due to the absence	1
of confusion concerning the dharmas pertinent to defilement and purifi-	1
cation. Hence the meditative development of the applications of mind-	1
fulness is established at the beginning for the comprehension of the	1
four truths.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y166.15 [1] Why is the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness described	1
firstly and not the other, i.e. the meditative development of the factors that contribute to	1
enlightenment? He says: Now, in regard to these, in the beginning:	1
IV.1 a	0
...Due to: (a) disquiet, (b) the cause	1
of craving etc.	1
"""In regard to these"" [means]: in regard to the meditative development of the factors that"	1
"contribute to enlightenment. The word ""now"" has the sense of sequential order. Now,"	1
at the beginning, the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness is	1
mentioned and [the meditative development of the others [are mentioned] subse-	1
Read: dauşthulyat tarşahetutväd in place of dauşthulyatṛṣṇahetutvād; cf. Bhāṣya N50.6.Y168	0
quently. Because they are not aware of the virtues and faults of nirvana andsamsāra	0
[respectively] on account of their notional attachment to something pleasurable, pure,	1
permanent and substantial among the formative forces, naive people delight in enjoy-	1
ment and existence and are fearful of the meaning of nirvāṇa7. Moreover, this lack of	1
awareness in regard to virtues and faults and the notional attachment to the pleasurable	1
etc. are checked because of the insight into the truths. Hence, in order to encourage	0
them to shrink from samsāra and to bring them face to face with nirvāṇa, just the	1
meditative development of the applications of mindfulness is mentioned at	0
the beginning for the comprehension of the four truths.	1
[2] Disquiet is made manifest through the body. Disquiet (dauşthulya) is	1
[equivalent to] uneasiness (duḥsthitatā) because, while it is formatively influenced	1
every day, the body is certainly changed; hence disquiet is made manifest through the	1
body. Consequently, one comprehends the truth of suffering through the	1
investigation of the body. As to why this is so, he says: because [the body] is	1
characterized by the formative forces together with disquiets. Since the	1
formative forces, accompanied by disquiet, are the characteristic, i.e. the own-being, of	1
the truth of suffering and disquiet is made manifest through the body, therefore, one	0
comprehends the truth of suffering through the investigation of the body. However,	1
since disquiet is not understood, he says: for, disquiet consists in the painful	1
nature of the formative forces. Formative force refers to the arising of states [of	1
existence]; and since it is the foundation of all ruin, it is disquiet. And this consists in	1
suffering because it is repugnant to the Noble Ones. As has been said:	1
This rebirth is unfortunate, for when there is birth, there are the enemies of	1
old-age, death, disease, misfortune, murder, bondage and so on. These mis-	1
fortunes would not occur if the body9 did not originate, [just as] there would be	1
no destruction through fire, wind and forest fires if trees did not arise.	1
On account of this, i.e. it is on account of the painful nature of the formative	1
forces, and not on account of the painful nature of change nor the painful nature of	1
suffering, because: (a) the latter two do not pervade and (b) they are the causes of the	1
painful nature of the formative forces. The Noble Ones regard all impure enti-	1
ties in terms of suffering10 but not [entities] that are free from impurity because	1

the truth of the path is the counteragent to the arising of rebirth. However, ordinary	0
people¹2 do not [regard impure entities in terms of suffering] because their mental	1
disposition is impaired by erroneous inversion¹3. The following is stated in a Sūtra	1
"too: ""In brief, suffering consists in the five aggregates that have been appropriated."""	1
Others believe that the painful nature of the formative forces is [equivalent to] the lack	1
of pliability (akarmaṇyata). Others again believe that disquiet does not consist in the	1
lack of pliability 14. What is the reason? The state of being accompanied by impurity	1
should necessarily be acknowledged as having arisen from a causal 'seed' because the	1
lack of pliability15 is accompanied by impurity, however sometimes, even without a	1
'seed' [lack of pliability] exists in the mental continuum of an arhat due to a defect in	1
diet, or environment¹6 etc. and this does not have the capacity to become disquiet	1
because it is free from impurity. Hence, it is the 'seed' of an impure dharma which	0
lodges in the store-consciousness and is considered as disquiet in this context. This	1
body, accompanied by [sensations that are] pleasurable, painful and neither pleasurable	0
nor painful, is the result of that ['seed']. Therefore, disquiet is made manifest through	1
the body which comes into being every moment accompanied by the state17 of pleasure	1
"etc. The term [""made manifest""] is equivalent in meaning to 'made evident'. For"	0
example, a seed that has slipped into a crack in the floor of a granary [manifests]18	1
through its sprout. Therefore, one comprehends the truth of suffering through the	0
"investigation of the body. Here now he gives the reason: ""because [the body] is char-"	1
"acterized by the formative forces together with disquiet"" 19. What is meant is: because"	1
[suffering] consists in the formative forces together with their 'seeds'. For, the painful	1
nature of the formative forces is described as disquiet20 because: (a) it is associated	1
with the disquiet of both the painful nature of change and the painful nature of suffer-	1
ing and (b) it is the cause of these two21. Hence, on account of the painful nature of the	1
formative forces the Noble Ones regard all impure entities in terms of suffering22. In	1
this way one comprehends the truth of suffering through the application of the mind-	1
fulness of the body.	1

[3] The cause of craving is sensation. The intended meaning here is that it	1
arises from contact which consists in ignorance, because [sensation] that is free from	1
impurity does not cause such[ craving]. In this respect, a pleasurable sensation is the	1
cause of the craving for connection with that [sensation] and non-separation from it. A	1
painful [sensation] is the cause of the craving for separation from that (sensation] and	1
non-connection with it. [A sensation that is neither pleasurable nor painful is the	1
cause of: (a) craving for the delight in that state and (b) craving for connection with that	1
[sensation] and non-separation from it23 in regard to any attainment. Even a painful	1
"sensation is a cause of craving for pleasure since it is said that: ""one who has made"	1
"contact24 with a painful sensation rejoices in the pleasure of sensual delight."" One"	1
comprehends the truth of origination through the investigation of this.	1
While investigating sensation by way of essential nature, cause, effect, impermanence25	1
and suffering, one indeed comprehends the truth of origination. What is meant is: one	1
understands that craving is the effect of these [sensations]. In a Sūtra, craving is	1
"described as the truth of origination; in detail it is said: ""What is the origination of"	1
suffering? It is the craving which leads to further existence and which is accompanied	1
"by the passion for joy.""2 In this way one comprehends the truth of origination"	1
through the application of the mindfulness of sensation.	1
[4] Mind is the foundation for the notional attachment to the self. Since	1
there is no other self that is distinguished by the quality of permanence etc., the objec-	1
tive support for the notional attachment to the self is mind alone. Therefore, through	1
the investigation of this, one comprehends the truth of cessation, i.e. as	1
tranquillity. Here now he provides the reason: due to the removal of the fear of	0
self-annihilation. For the notional attachment to the self is checked by investigat-	1
ing impermanence etc. in regard to mind, and its perception as suffering arises. Hence,	1
due to the removal of the fear of self-annihilation, one comprehends the truth of cessa-	1
tion as tranquillity 27 because it is [equivalent to] the annihilation of suffering alone. In	1
this way one comprehends the truth of cessation through the application of the mind-	1
fulness of mind 28.	1
[5] Through the investigation of the dharmas, one comprehends the	1
truth of the path due to the absence of confusion concerning the	1

defilement and purification, one comes face to face with the expedient for the absolute	1
relinquishment of all distress, i.e. the truth of the path. In this way one comprehends	1
the truth of the path through the application of the mindfulness of the dharmas.	1
"[6] ""Comprehension"" in the above refers to the understanding of the characteristic of"	1
truth in regard to each of the [four] truths. Therein, the meditative development of the	1
applications of mindfulness of the body refers to [its understanding] as: (a) imperma-	1
nent, painful, empty and insubstantial, (b) having many impure substances for its own-	1
(c) the 'seed' of the impure, (d) the outflow of the ure, (e) the cause of	1
continued existence of impurity, (f) a modification into impurity, (g) the absence of	1
essence, like a mass of foam, (h) a state of existence and (i) a place of birth. Further-	1
more, the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness of sensation, mind	1
and the dharmas refers to [their understanding] as: (a) impermanent, painful, empty and	0
insubstantial, (b) an individual characteristic, (c) a universal characteristic³0, (d) a	1
cause, (e) a result, (f) a realm of existence, spiritual level and state of existence, (g)	1
wholesome, unwholesome and undefined and (h) adverse elements and counteragents.	0
For the bodhisattvas however, the meditative development of the applications of mind-	1
fulness for the purpose of the relinquishment of conceptual differentiation is both in	1
this way [as described] and is also in the aspect of non-perception. Although the	1
"applications of mindfulness have wisdom for their own-being, the term ""applications"	1
"of mindfulness"" is so-called because [the wisdom elements] are applied by the force of"	1
mindfulness, or, mindfulness is applied by means of these [wisdom elements ] ³1.	1

When there is clear comprehension of the adverse elements and their	1
counteragents, in all modes, through the meditative development of the	1
applications of mindfulness a fourfold vigour arises for : (a) the	1
removal of the adverse elements and (b) the production of their counter-	1
agents. In detail, these are for the relinquishment of the evil unwhole-	1
some dharmas that have already arisen.	0

...Through the meditative development of the applications of mindful-	1

meditative development of the application of the mindfulness of the dharmas. When	1
there is clear comprehension of the adverse elements and their counter-	1
agents, in all modes 34; i.e. [in modes such as] the relinquishment of the realms of	1
existence and spiritual levels and in aspects of the universal characteristic etc., and also,	1
according to their differentiation as: impure, without impurity, realm of existence,	1
spiritual level, one still in training and the adept etc.35 For: (a) the removal of the	0

adverse elements; the removal of adverse elements³6 here signifies the breaking of	0
the continuity of those that have already arisen and the non-generation of those that	1
have not yet arisen. And (b) the production of their counteragents³7; the pro-	1
duction of their counteragents is [equivalent to] the continuing supply of those that	1
have already arisen and the generation of those that have not yet arisen. A fourfold	1
vigour³8 arises39, i.e. a fourfold vigour arises according to its differentiation as an	1
adverse element or counteragent, which has already arisen or has not yet arisen. In	1
detail, these are for the relinquishment of the evil, unwholesome	1
dharmas that have already arisen. By this he shows the fourfold arising of	1
"vigour in accordance with scriptural tradition. The term ""in detail"" refers to additional"	1
text; this is the additional text: For the relinquishment [of evil unwholesome elements	1
that have already arisen]40 one generates will-power, makes endeavour, undertakes	1
with vigour, 'seizes' the mind and strives with correct effort. Thus, in detail: one	1
generates will-power for the non-production of the evil, unwholesome dharmas that	1
have not yet arisen. Similarly, in detail: one generates will-power for the production of	1
the wholesome dharmas that have not yet arisen. For the maintenance, increase, [non-	1
deprivation]41 and completion of the wholesome dharmas that have already arisen, one	1
generates will-power, makes endeavour, undertakes with vigour, 'seizes' the mind and	1
strives with correct effort. The maintenance of those that have arisen refers to their	1
non-decrease42. Increase is [equivalent to] continuous production; completion is	0
"[equivalent to] culmination. By the rds: ""one generates will-power"", he shows that"	1
"it is an earnest application of the meditative development of vigour43. By ""one makes"	1
"endeavour"" is meant: one focuses on the body and mind for the relinquishment of lazi-"	0
"ness44. ""One undertakes with vigour"", in order to dispel both indolence and excitabil-"	1
ity. How does one undertake? By 'seizing' the sluggish mind through the mental	1

The pliability of the stability of mind in the context of that medita-	1

[dharmas] 49 consists in the four bases of psychic power because they	0
are the causes of mental power in all subjects, Stability, which refers	1
to the stability of mind here, should be known as meditative concentra-	1
tion. Hence, the bases of psychic power follow immediately after the	1
correct exertions. Furthermore, this pliability is to be known as	1
following from the meditative development of the eight formative forces	0
that facilitate relinquishment leading to the relinquishment of the five	1
faults.	1

production of adverse elements and their counteragents51; pliability 52 is [equivalent	0
to] the capacity for mental power in all subjects and this pliability comes about under	1
the influence of will-power, vigour, mind and examination. Hence he says: pliability	1
consists in the four bases of psychic power. Psychic power is [equivalent to]	1
mental power in all subjects such as the higher knowledges. These are the bases of	1
psychic power in the sense that they are the support for it - what is meant is: the bases	1
of psychic power are the causes of psychic power53. Hence he says: because they	1
are the causes of mental power. Moreover, they are: (a) the base of psychic	1
power associated with the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which	1
consists in the meditative concentration of will-power. (b) The base of psychic power	1
associated with the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in	1
the meditative concentration of vigour. (c) The base of psychic power associated with	1
the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in the meditative	1
concentration of mind. (d) The base of psychic power associated with the formative	1
force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in the meditative concentration	1
of examination. Of these, (a) the meditative concentration of will-power occurs when	1
one attains single-pointedness of mind while earnestly engaging in the meditative	1
development of vigour under the influence of will-power. (b) The meditative concen-	1
tration of vigour occurs when one attains single-pointedness of mind while undertak-	1
ing with vigour due to continual application. (c) The meditative concentration of mind	1
occurs when one attains single-pointedness of mind while holding the mind on mind	1
alone owing to the 'seed' of previous meditative concentration. (d) The meditative con-	1
centration of examination occurs when one who has thoroughly analysed the objective	1
support attains single-pointedness of mind. Stability, which refers to the	1
stability of mind here, should be known as meditative concentration; the	1
reference to meditative concentration is for the purpose of distinguishing this from	1
those [states] characterized by the conditioned elements. The pliability of mind 54	1
pertinent to one who has undertaken with vigour consists in the four bases of psychic	0
power; hence 55, the bases of psychic power are explained immediately.	1

The Five Faults.	1
Which are the five faults?	1
He says:	1
Laziness, (b) the forgetting of	0
instructions, (c) indolence and	1
excitability 59, (d) the absence of for-	1
mative influence and (e) formative	1
influence these are considered as	1
the five faults.	1
IV.4 abcd	1
In the above, indolence and excitability are made one fault. The	1
absence of formative influence is a fault at the time of the tranquilliza-	1
tion of indolence and excitability. Formative influence [is a fault] at	1
[the time of] tranquillity.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y173.11 [1] Since these five faults are not known, he asks: which are the five faults 260 In	1
order to demonstrate them he says:	1
IV.4 ab	0
(a) Laziness, (b) the forgetting of	1
instructions, (c) indolence and	1
excitability 61 etc.	1
Since these faults number six, he says: in the above, indolence and excitability	1
are made one fault thus there are five. Of these, laziness is a fault at the time of	1
application because the absence of application is on account of it. The forgetting of	1
instructions is a fault on the part of one who has undertaken [to act] because the	1
absence of the concentration of mind is on account of it. Indolence / excitability is a	1
fault on the part of one whose mind is concentrated because the absence of pliability of	1
mind is on account of this. The absence of formative influence is a fault at	1
"58 The Tib. for this final section (Y173.7-9) is slightly different: ""...what is its cause? Hence he"	0
says: ..is to be known as following from the cause which is the meditative	1
development of the formative forces for the relinquishment of the five faults	1

the time 62 of [the tranquillization of]63 indolence and excitability; the	0
absence of formative influence is [equivalent to] indifference because the absence of	1
the tranquillization of these two is on account of that. Formative influence [is a	1
"fault] at [the time of] tranquillity; [the word] ""fault"" remains in force. Forma-"	1
tive influence consists in volition, for it is said that tranquillity is due to the attainment	1
of 'sameness' (samatā) which is because of the removal of indolence and excitability.	1
The Eight Formative Forces that Facilitate Relinquishment.	1
How are the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment	1
respectively determined for the relinquishment of those [faults]? Four	1
are for the relinquishment of laziness, namely: (a) will-power, (b)	1
effort, (c) faith and (d) quiescence. Moreover, these should be known	1
sequentially as:	1
IV.5 ab	1
(a) Will-power is the basis of effort. (b) Effort is that which is	1
based [on will-power]. (c) Faith is the cause of that basis, i.e. will-	1
power, because there is an eagerness in one who has firm belief. (d)	1
Quiescence is the result of that which is based [on will-power], i.e.	1
effort, because one who undertakes with vigour attains a special medi-	0
tative concentration.	1
(a) The basis, (b) that which is based	1
on it, (c) the cause of the former and	1
(d) the result;	1
There are four remaining formative forces that facilitate relinquish-	0
ment, namely, (a) mindfulness, (b) full awareness, (c) volition and (d)	1
equanimity which are the counteragents to the [other] four faults as	1
enumerated. Furthermore, they should be known sequentially, begin-	1
ning with mindfulness:	1
IV.S cdef	1
(a) the non-loss64 of the objective	1
support, (b) the understanding of	0
indolence and excitability, (c) the	1
formative influence for the removal	1
of the latter and (d) the employment	1
of meditative calm when appease-	1
ment occurs.	1

Read perhaps: 'sampramoso for metrical reasons in place of 'sammoso; cf. Nagao's fn.3 p.52.233	1
(a) Mindfulness is the non-loss of the objective support. (b) Full	1
awareness is the understanding of indolence and excitability when there	1
is no loss of mindfulness. (c) Volition is the formative influence for	1
the removal of the latter [two] after they have been understood. (d) The	1
employment of meditative calm refers to the equanimity of mind that	1
occurs when that indolence and excitability are appeased.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y174.4 [1] [The term]: 'formative forces that facilitate relinquishment' (prahäṇa-samskäräḥ)65	1
is [resolved as]: 'formative forces that lead to relinquishment (prahāṇāya samskäräh)	1
[i.e. as a tatpuruşa compound]. They are for the relinquishment of what? For the	1
relinquishment of the five faults that have just been described. If so, then this should	1
be stated: How are the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment	1
respectively determined for the relinquishment of those66 [faults]? Of	1
these, four are for the relinquishment of laziness, namely: (a) will-	1
power, (b) effort, (c) faith and (d) quiescence. Will-power therein is	1
[equivalent to] eagerness; effort is [equivalent to] vigour; faith is [equivalent to] firm	1
belief; and quiescence is [equivalent to] pliability. Just how are they respectively	1
determined as leading to the relinquishment of laziness? Hence he says: moreover,	1
these should be known sequentially as:	1
IV.5 ab	1
(a) The basis, (b) that which is based	1
on it, (c) the cause of the former and	1
(d) the result;	1
Hence he shows that they are conducive to the relinquishment of laziness because they	0
arise 67 one from the other. (a) Will-power is the basis of effort. (b) Effort	1
is that which is based [on will-power], because eagerness is preceded by	1
effort. (c) Faith is the cause of that basis68, i.e. will-power... How so? He	1
says: ...because there is an eagerness in one who has firm belief, for, one	1
who possesses faith in regard to the cause and result is eager to act. Quiescence is	1
the result of that which is based [on will-power], i.e. effort. How so?	1
He says: ...because one who undertakes with vigour attains a special	1
meditative concentration; for the attainment of a special meditative concentration	1
is the cause of quiescence. Hence quiescence is described as the result of effort	1
because one who undertakes with vigour attains a special meditative concentration.	1

For thus, joy arises in one who has undertaken with vigour due to the absence of the	1
fault of conceptual differentiation that consists in disquiet69. The quiescence of body	0
and mind that results from a joyous mind has the characteristic70 of pliability; conse-	1
"quently, it is described as: ""the attainment of a special meditative concentration""."	1
Moreover, in this context, it is vigour together with its cause and result that is	1
described as the counteragent71 to laziness.	1
[2] [The remaining four formative forces that facilitate relinquishment,	1
namely: (a) mindfulness, (b) full awareness, (c) volition and (d) equa-	1
nimity are the counteragents to the [other] four faults as enumerated.	1
Of these, mindfulness is the counteragent to the forgetting of instructions. Full aware-	1
ness is [the counteragent] to indolence and excitability. Volition is [the counteragent}	1
to the absence of formative influence. Equanimity is [the counteragent] to formative	1
influence; in this context it is the equanimity that consists in the formative forces that is	1
to be understood. Moreover, since he wishes to discuss the characteristic of mindful-	1
ness etc. here, he says: furthermore, they should be known sequentially,	1
beginning with mindfulness. [mindfulness refers to:]	1
IV.5 c	1
(a) non-loss of an objective support	1
(a) Mindfulness is the non-loss of an objective support; what is meant is:	1
the expression of the content of an instruction conducive to the stability of mind 72.	1
Full awareness is the understanding of indolence and excitability when	1
there is no loss of mindfulness, for, one for whom mindfulness is present	1
"possesses full awareness; this why he says: ""when there is no loss of mindfulness""."	1
After they are understood, i.e. indolence and excitability; what is meant is: [full	1
awareness] arises effortlessly due to the coupling of the two, i.e. meditative calm and	1
"penetrating insight. By ""equanimity"" is meant: the absence of formative influence in"	1
regard to other objects. This is what is being said: one for whom mindfulness is	1
present understands the sluggish or excited mind, as it is in reality, when instruction [is	1
given]; and in order to be rid of indolence and excitability he formatively influences	1
that [mind]. Also, due to the disappearance of both indolence and excitability, equa-	1
nimity is created. Thus the meditative calm that belongs to the mind of such a person	1

support, (d) the influence of non-diffusion and (e) the influence of	1
thorough analysis. The five faculties beginning with faith should be	1
known in sequential order.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] It is the fact that the five faculties beginning with faith were described	1
immediately after the bases of psychic power that is referred to. How are	1
they respectively established? The intended meaning is: in what sense [are they	1
respectively established]? Hence he says:	1

"The words: ""due to the influence of 75 remain in force [in each case]; by"	1
"this statement he shows that the term ""influence"" employed here, i.e. in the phrase ""it is"	1
"due to the influence of: (a) will-power, (b) application..."", remains in force for each"	1
subsequent [faculty] as well. When the root of the wholesome which is con-	1
ducive to liberation has been fostered76 by the bases of psychic power in	1
one who has mental pliability...; the root of the wholesome which is conducive	1
to liberation finds a support in the mental continuum 77 of one who has mental pliability.	1
...It is due to: (a) the influence of will-power etc., concluding with (e) the	1
influence of thorough analysis; but not in one who does not have mental pliabil-	1
ity. Moreover, this mental pliability comes about through the bases of psychic power.	1
Therefore, immediately after the bases of psychic power, the five faculties beginning	1
with faith are respectively determined as being due to the influence of the fostering of	1
the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation. It is actually faith that is	0
"referred to by the term ""will-power"" in the statement: ""...from the influence of will-"	1
"power"", for, the effect is expressed figuratively here in regard to the cause [i.e. will-"	1
power is the cause of faith]. Just as, for example, [the eating of] yoghurt and melon	1
[which is the cause] is [figuratively described as] a sudden fever. Alternatively, belief,	1
serene faith, and eagerness respecively with regard to existence, the possession of	1
virtue 78 and ability are the characteristics of faith. Hence, through the reference to will-	1
power79 in this context, it is actually faith as characterized by eagerness that is referred	1
to and not will-power. (b) The influence of application; it is application	1
(prayoga) since one applies oneself (prayujyate) by means of this. By the word	0
'application', it is vigour that is intended. (c) The influence of the non-loss 80 of	1
the objective support; i.e. due to the influence of the faculty of mindfulness. The	0
faculty of mindfulness is characterized by the distinct expression of the objective	1
support81. (d) The influence of non-diffusion; i.e. due to the influence of the	0
faculty of meditative concentration, for, non-diffusion consists in the faculty of medita-	1
tive concentration because this is characterized by single-pointedness of mind. And	1
(e) the influence of thorough analysis; i.e. due to the influence of the faculty of	1
wisdom because the faculty of wisdom has the nature of the thorough analysis of the	1
"dharmas. The word ""and"" shows that the five faculties beginning with faith82"	1
should be known in sequential order because they are the influences in the	1

fostering of the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation83. One who	0
has faith undertakes with vigour in order to escape from the prison of samsăra, and,	1
since one who has undertaken with vigour84 accomplishes the three teachings, the	1
faculties of mindfulness, meditative concentration and wisdom follow in sequential	1
order. Thus, at the level of application on the path of vision, the faculties are consid-	1
ered to be of central importance.	1
[2] However, others believe that faith etc. are not faculties because they influence the	1
nourishment of the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation. Rather,	0
they are described as faculties because when the root of the wholesome which is con-	1
ducive to liberation is nourished, faith etc. exercise influence. It is in order to demon-	0
"strate just this that he says: ""due to the influence of will-power"", faith is a faculty; the"	1
latter is to be supplied. Application is [equivalent to] performance. Not forgetting [or	1
non-loss; asammoșa; asampramoșa] is [equivalent to the non-disappearance of the	1
objective support. Non-diffusion is [equivalent to] non-dispersion. Analysis 85 is	1
[equivalent to] thorough analysis. The mental concomitants called vigour, mindful-	1
ness, meditative concentration and wisdom are termed faculties because of their influ-	1
ence over application, non-forgetfullness, non-diffusion and thorough analysis. How-	1
ever, the following should be stated in this regard: when the root of the wholesome	0
which is conducive to liberation has been nourished there is no difference in own-	0
being, in comparison with the unnourised state86, between the influence of will-power	1
etc. and faith etc.87 because at that time they are established as faculties due to their	1
influence over it [i.e. the root of the wholesome].	1
These same [elements], i.e. faith etc., are described as the powers	1
when they possess power.	1
Moreover, their possession of power is:	1

When they are not intermixed with adverse elements such as lack of	1
faith. Why is there an initial and subsequent explanation of faith etc.?	1
Because:	1
the latter is the result of the former;	1
For, one who possesses faith undertakes with vigour in regard to	0
cause and result. Mindfulness is present for one who has undertaken	1
with vigour; the mind of one for whom mindfulness is present becomes	1
concentrated; one whose mind is concentrated understands [phenomena]	1
as they are in reality. The faculties that pertain to the elements which	1
are conducive to liberation, and which have been nourished, have now	1
been described.	1

Now, should the elements that are conducive to penetration be	1
known as being in the state of a 'faculty' or in the state of a 'power'?	1

The elements conducive to penetra-	1
tion are in twos, i.e. both faculties	1
and powers.	1
The [state of] heat and the summit are faculties; the receptivities and	1

[Sthiramati]	1
Y177.22 [1] These same [elements], i.e. faith etc., which are discussed immediately	1
after the faculties, are described as the powers when they possess power.	1
Moreover, their possession of power is due to what? Hence he says:	1
IV.7 a	0
Due to the curbing of adverse ele-	1
ments;	1
Because the adverse elements are curbed. In order to demonstrate just this, he says:	0
when these faculties such as faith are not intermixed with adverse elements	1
such as lack of faith, i.e. with lack of faith88, laziness, forgetfulness, distraction89	1
and lack of full awareness which are adverse to faith etc.; what is meant is: they do not	1
intermingle [with adverse elements] because, being extremely attenuated they do not	1
manifest time and again at that time they are described as 'powers'. These faculties are	1
intermixed with adverse elements at that time because the elements that are adverse to	1
them have not been erased.	1
[2] If the faculties are possessed of adverse elements that have not been subdued, how	1
then, can faith etc. be described as 'faculties' by way of the influence of mundane purity	1
in [Chapter III. 10 titled] 'The Reality of the Skills'? Because in that section the faculties	1
Ms.(57a.7): iti/aśraddhya-; disregard Y's fn.1 p.178.	0
Ms.(57a.7): -vikşepa-; disregard Y's fn.2 p.178.Y179	1
are intended as being without differentiation but here they are differentiated in order to	0
demonstrate the differentiation of the root of the wholesome which is conducive to	1
"penetration therefore there is no contradiction. Only hence does he say: ""these same"	1
"faculties...are described as 'powers""."	1
[3] For, one who possesses faith undertakes with vigour in regard to	1
the cause and result90; i.e. he connects the cause with its respective result and vice	1
versa. Thus, because of his faith in the result, one who possesses faith undertakes	1
with vigour in regard to the cause. Mindfulness is present for one who has	1
undertaken with vigour because it depends upon the latter91. The mind of one	1
for whom mindfulness is present becomes concentrated, i.e. it becomes	1
single-pointed because there is no distraction. One whose mind is concentrated	1
understands [phenomena] as they are in reality; i.e. the wisdom that is	0
assisted by meditative concentration becomes pure. The faculties that pertain to	1
the elements which are conducive to liberation, and which have been	1
nourished 92, have now been described.	1
[4] The elements which are conducive to penetration follow immediately after the	1
elements which are conducive to liberation and the powers follow immediately after the	1
faculties, hence this should be stated: should the elements conducive to pene-	1
tration be known as being in the state of a 'faculty' or in the state of a	1
'power¹937 Similarly, do the essential natures of the faculties and the powers consist	1
in the elements that are conducive to penetration, or are their essential natures separate	1
from them? Hence, [answering] all of these [questions] he says:	1
IV.7 cd	0
The elements conducive to penetra-	1
tion are in twos: both faculties and	1
powers.	1
Alternatively, in the same way that the elements that are conducive to liberation are	1
characterized by the meditative development of the counteragent, or are characterized	1
by faith etc., so too are the elements that are conducive to penetration; consequently, he	1
"says: ""the faculties that pertain to the elements which are conducive to liberation, and"	1
"which have been nourished 94, have now been described etc."" Hence he then says: ""the"	1
"elements conducive to penetration are in twos""."	1

[5] The [states of] heat 95 and the summit are faculties; they are definitely	1
faculties because these [roots of the 196 wholesome are feeble since it is untenable 97 that	1
there are powers 98 among them. The receptivities and highest mundane real-	1
izations are powers. The receptivities and highest mundane realizations are	1
definitely powers for it is impossible that these can be faculties because of their	1
strength. Moreover, faith etc. are threefold according to their differentiation as weak,	1
middling and strong. The weak and middling of these are the faculties and the strong	1
are the powers. Those that are weak are the [states of] heat; the middling are the	1
summits. However the strong therein are divided into four: the weak, the middling and	1
the strong are, respectively, the weak, middling and strong receptivities; while the	1
strongest of the strong are the highest mundane realizations. Moreover, all99 of these	1
elements that are conducive to penetration 100, together with their associated elements,	1
have meditative concentration and wisdom for their essential nature; the aspect of heat	1
in the latter is the [state of] heat. For example, from the rubbing together of kindling	1
sticks, heat is produced which is the first mark of the arising (utpatti-cihna) of the fire	1
which has the capacity to burn that [fuel]. Similarly, the [state of] heat is so-called101	1
because its nature precedes the 'fire' of the noble path which has the capacity to	1
consume the 'fuel' of all moral defilement. The summit [is so-called] since it extends	1
up until the summit away from fickle roots of the wholesome. The receptivities [are	1
so-called] because they consist in perseverance in the meaning of the [four] truths. The	1
highest mundane realizations are so-called because they are accompanied by impurity	1
and also because they are foremost among the other impure dharmas. Their pre-	1
eminence is due to the fact that the origination of the path of vision occurs immediately	1
after [the realization of them. Moreover, they are momentary, [whereas] the other	1
elements that are conducive to penetration are continuous. In the above, the root of the	1
wholesome [the realization of] which is conducive to liberation, should be known as	1
the yoga that destroys the power that causes samsāra to come into being. [The realiza-	1
tion of those conducive to penetration [should be known] as the yoga that generates	1
the power for the arising of dharmas that are not accompanied by impurity.	0

(a) The limb of the basis, (b) the	1
limb of own-being, (c) the limb of	1
setting forth is the third, (d) the limb	1
of advantage is the fourth and (e) the	1
limb of the absence of defilement is	0
considered as threefold.	1
The limbs of enlightenment refer to the limbs that lead to enlighten-	1
ment on the path of vision. Of these, (a) the limb of the basis of	1
enlightenment refers to mindfulness. (b) The limb of own-being refers	1
to the analysis of the dharmas. (c) The limb of setting forth refers to	1
vigour. (d) The limb of advantage refers to delight. (e) The limb of the	1
absence of defilement which is threefold refers to: quiescence, medita-	1
tive concentration and equanimity. But why is the limb of the absence	1
of defilement taught as threefold?	1
IV.9 ab	1
It is taught by way of: (a) the	1
underlying cause, (b) the basis and	1
(c) the own-being;	1
(a) The underlying cause of the absence of defilement refers to	0
quiescence because defilement is caused by disquiet and [quiescence] is	1
the counteragent to the latter. (b) The basis refers to meditative	1
concentration. (c) The own-being refers to equanimity.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y180.10 [1] Since the path of vision arises immediately after the highest [mundane] realizations	1
and because it is characterized by the limbs of enlightenment, he says: the limbs of	0
enlightenment follow immediately after the powers. How are they	1
established 102? The intended meaning is: for what purpose are they established?	1
Hence he says:	1
IV.8 a	0
(a) The limb of the basis, (b) the	1
limb of own-being etc.	1
The limbs of enlightenment refer the limbs that lead to enlightenment	1
on the path of vision. It is [described as] vision (darśana) since [the aspirant] has	0
Read: teşam katham vyavasthanam in place of katham etäni vyavasthapyanta; cf. Bhaşya	0
N53.13.Y181	1
the perception, for the very first time, of a reality that was previously unseen; and since	0
it causes the attainment of the noble spiritual levels it is the path (märga); hence it is	1
described as the path of vision (darśana-marga). For, in the state of [the realization of]	1
the elements that are conducive to penetration 103, the [four] truths are perceived as	1
though concealed by a ine silken cloth; [whereas] in the state of the path of vision, it is	1
as though that [cloth] has been removed. In the above, enlightenment104, which refers	1
to the perfect comprehension of reality, consists in the direct intuition that is free from	1
conceptual differentiation. With regard to that, the six beginning with mindfulness are	1
[described as] its limbs because they are in conformity with enlightenment. However,	1
the analysis of the dharmas is (equivalent to] enlightenment because it has the nature of	1
understanding 105 and it is a 'limb' because it is a 'companion' to the others 106. Another	1
[school] believes that the analysis of the dharmas, which is included in the path that	1
brings an immediate result (änantarya-märga), is [only] a limb of enlightenment but	1
that [analysis] which is included in the path of liberation (vimukti-mārga) [equivalent	1
to] enlightenment.	1
[2] Of these, (a) the limb of the basis of enlightenment107 refers to	1
mindfulness; because the absence of distraction in regard to an objective support is	0
through the force of mindfulness. (b) The limb of own-being refers to the	1
analysis of the dharmas; because enlightenment has direct intuition for its own-	1
being 108	0
(c) The limb of setting forth refers to vigour; because the level of	1
ordinary people is completely transcended through vigour. (d) The limb of	1
advantage refers to delight; because the benefits to body and mind¹09 are on	0
account of this. (e) The limb of the absence of defilement which is three-	1
fold refers to: quiescence, meditative concentration and equanimity	1
because these are counteragents to defilement. Alternatively, it is because they are	0
differentiated as the underlying cause, the basis and the own-being of the absence of	1
defilement.	1
[3] But why is the limb of the absence of defilement taught as three-	1
fold? The intended meaning is: in what sense is it taught as threefold? Hence he	1
says:	1

It is taught by way of: (a) the	1
underlying cause, (b) the basis and	1
(c) the own-being;	1
(a) The underlying cause of the absence of defilement refers to quies-	1
cenceli0; the absence of defilement is [equivalent to] cation. The underlying	1
cause (nidäna) is [equivalent to] the cause [kāraṇa]. As to why it is the underlying	1
cause, he says: because defilement is caused by disquiet and because	1
[quiescence] is the counteragent to the latter. This is what is being said:	0
[quiescence] is the underlying cause of the absence of defilement because it is the	1
counteragent to the underlying cause of defilement. Disquiet consists in physical and	1
mental inefficiency; when this exists, mind becomes distracted because single-pointed-	1
ness of the mind is impossible. Moreover, defilement, such as passion, arises in one	1
whose mind is distracted; thus, disquiet is the cause of defilement. The counteragent to	1
that disquiet is quiescence. How so? Because quiescence brings about physical and	1
mental efficiency¹12. In this way quiescence is determined to be the underlying cause	1
of the absence of defilement. (b) The basis refers to meditative concentra-	1
tion. The mind is concentrated in one whose body and mind are assisted by quies-	1
cence; when the mind becomes concentrated, one understands [phenomena] as they are	1
in reality and moral defilement is relinquished because one sees them as they are in	1
reality. Thus, the basis of the absence of defilement is meditative concentration. (c)	1
The own-being refers to equanimity because this is the counteragent to: (a)	1
mind's unevenness, (b) mind's absence of meditative calm and (c) mind's state of	1
effort 13, all of which are conformable to the defiled condition. Thus, the own-being of	1
the absence of defilement is equanimity.	1
[4] However, others believe that when defilement which is to be relinquished through	1
vision has been relinquished by means of the paths of relinquishment114, wisdom is	1
generated ¹15 that is free from the encumbrances of that defilement, is pure in its own-	1
being, is incorporated in the path of liberation¹16 and is positively determined in regard	1
to the knowable. That wisdom is described as equanimity in this context since one	1
"shows equanimity in thinking: ""there is extinction in regard to extinction"", because"	1
what is to be done has been done.	1

(d) the counteragent to adverse	0
elements;	1
On the path of meditative development, the limb for the accurate	0
determination of the path of vision117 is mundane correct view which is	1
obtained subsequently to the supramundane by means of this, one	1
accurately determines one's own understanding. The limbs for the	1
attainment of others are correct intention and correct speech because	1
their attainment is on account of speech together with that which causes	1
its arising. The limbs for the confidence of others are threefold: correct	1
speech, correct action and correct livelihood, for, by means of these	1
respectively:	0
IV.10 cd	1
It is considered that another is in-	1
formed in regard to vision, morality	1
and austerity.	1
One has confidence in wisdom on account of correct speechli8, i.e.	1
on account of discussion and certainty in regard to doctrinal disputa-	1
tion. [One has confidence] in morality on account of correct action	1
because one does not perform action that should not be performed.	1
[One has confidence] in austerity on account of correct livelihood	1
because of the Dharma and also because one's desire for garments etc.	1
is in moderation.	1
The limb that is the counteragent to adverse elements is threefold:	1
correct effort, correct mindfulness and correct meditative concentration,	1
for, these are respectively:	0

supremacy;	0
what is adverse to	0
For the adverse elements are threefold: (a) the moral defilement to be	0
abandoned by meditative development, (b) the secondary defilements of	1
indolence and excitability and (c) that which is adverse to supremacy	1
and is an obstruction to the achievement of the special qualities. Here,	1
correct effort is the counteragent to the first, since the meditative devel-	1
opment of the path is on account of that. Correct mindfulness [is the	1
counteragent] to the second, because one who has properly applied	1
mindfulness in regard to the causal-signs of tranquillization etc., is free	1
from indolence and excitability. Correct meditative concentration [is	1
the counteragent] to the third because one achieves the qualities such as	1
the higher knowledges with the meditative absorptions for a basis.	1

[1] The limbs of the path follow immediately after the limbs of enlight-	1

development follows immediately after the path of vision and since the limbs of the	1

as being adverse to [the eight beginning with] false view and concluding with false	1
meditative concentration. Their sequential order is in accordance with their order of	1
efficacy 121; in detail, they consist in the path of meditative development. It is the path	1
of meditative development (bhāvanā-märga) since it is cultivated (bhavyate) through	1
the frequent exercise of meditative development (niṣevaṇa-bhāvanā).	1
[2] On that path of meditative development, the limb for the accurate	1
determination of the path of vision which is cultivated through meditative	1
development that has been attained is mundane correct view; it is mundane since it	1
is accompanied by conceptual differentiation. It is determined [as such] even for one	1
who has entered the path because such a person has acquired the capacity for its	1

arising; however, the supramundane is devoid of conceptual differentiation 122.	0
Although devoid of conceptual differentiation123, it is described as correct view since it	1
is the basis of correct view; hence he says: ...which is obtained subsequently to	1
the supramundane. What is meant is: [correct view] is obtained, i.e. has arisen,	1
subsequently, i.e. through the force of 24, the supramundane path of vision. But what	1
is its object? Hence he says: ...by means of this, one accurately determines	1
one's own understanding, i.e. one's understanding of the path of vision insofar as	1
"one thinks: ""I understand thus"". It is described as correct view because it has the path"	1
of vision for its object.	1
[3] The limbs for the attainment of others; in detail: the limbs for the attain-	1
ment of others ...are correct intention and correct speech because, by means of	1
correct speech and correct intention, others attain [the realization of] a reality that has	1
been accurately determined through correct view. Hence he says: because their	1
attainment is on account of speech together with that which causes its	1
arising; for, correct intention causes the arising of [correct] speech because of this	1
"statement from a Sutra: ""one does not utter a word without having conjectured and"	1
"deliberated"", 125 Moreover, one who is concentrated should be known as being"	1
endowed with these two [qualities] because he acquires the capacity to produce them;	1
however, one who is concentrated neither speculates nor speaks.	1
[4] The limbs for the confidence of others are threefold: correct speech,	1
correct action and correct livelihood. How so? He says: for, by means of	1
these, i.e. by means of correct speech126, action and livelihood, respectively:	1

On account of correct speech etc. Discussion refers to the teachings of the	1
Dharma; certainty concerning doctrinal disputation refers to the formulation of	1
objections and refutations in regard to spiritual realization, together with others. One	1
has confidence in wisdom on account of that discussion and certainty	1
concerning doctrinal disputation; i.e. due to the injunction of others 128 a reality	1

"diction and is crystal clear"". [One has confidence] in morality on account of"	1
"correct action; [the words]: ""one has confidence"" remain in force. Why [does one"	1
have confidence in morality...]? He says: because one does not perform action	1
that should not be performed. Correct action is contrary to evil conduct; hence,	1
one who is endowed with 30 this does not perform action that should not be per-	1
formed, even for the sake of his life. Consequently, since such a person possesses	1
morality that is pleasing to the Noble Ones, one has confidence in him. [One has	1
"confidence] in austerity on account of correct livelihood; [the words]: ""one"	1
"has confidence"" are understood. Why [does one have confidence in austerity...]? He"	1
says: because of the Dharma and also because one's desire for garments	1
131 is in moderation. Correct livelihood refers to the normal behaviour of body	0
and speech which is devoid of the faults of hypocrisy etc. for the sake of the necessi-	1
ties of life. On account of this, one has confidence in austerity and one's cravings for	1
the necessities of life certainly relinquished because such a person desires garments	1
etc. according to propriety and in moderation just for the sake of the continued exis-	1
tence of the basis [i.e. the physical body]132. In this regard, one has no pride on	1
account of correct view because of clear comprehension of one's own understanding	1
[of phenomena] as it is in reality. One speaks with the roar of a lion through the	1
speech which is caused to arisel33 by way of correct intention. By means of correct	1
speech 134, action and livelihood, one manifests one's individual status [i.e. as a śramaṇa	1
or brahmacări etc.].	1
[5] The limb that is the counteragent to adverse elements is threefold¹35	1
and since these are not known, he says: correct effort, correct mindfulness and	0
correct meditative concentration. As to which adverse elements these are the	1
counteragents, he says: for these 136 are, respectively:	1

Here, correct effort [is the counteragent] to the first. For, moral defilement	1
that is to be relinquished by means of meditative development is the first adverse	1
element; correct effort is the counteragent to that. How so? He says: since the	1
meditative development of the path is on account of that, i.e. is on account	1
of correct effort. Correct effort is [equivalent to] vigour which is taken possession of	1
by correct view and remains in meditative concentration free from indolence and	1
excitability¹37. By means of this, with the aim of relinquishing the moral defilements	1
which are to be relinquished through meditative development, one cultivates the path as	1
the counteragent to them; thus, correct effort is described as the counteragent to the first	1
because it causes the accomplishment of correct meditative concentration. In the	1
context of that same meditative development of the path, correct mindfulness [is	1
the counteragent] to the second, i.e. secondary defilement which is characterized	1
"by indolence and excitability; [the term] ""counteragent"" needs to be supplied. Why [is"	1
correct mindfulness the counteragent]? He says: because one who has properly	1
applied mindfulness in regard to the causal-signs of tranquillization etc.	1
"is free from indolence and excitability 138; by the word ""etc.""139 the causal-"	1
sign of exertion and the causal-sign of equanimity are also to be understood. Tranquil-	1
lization in this regard is due to the appeasement of the causal-sign of distraction. The	1
causal-sign (nimitta) of tranquillization etc. is [equivalent to] the cause (kärapa) of	1
tranquillization etc. With regard to this, when mind is excited or is suspected of	1
becoming excited, mental attention directed towards an entity that is apt to cause a	1
'shuddering'! 140 is the causal-sign of tranquillization. When mind is sluggish or is	0
suspected of becoming lethargic, mental attention directed towards an entity that is apt	1
to cause delight is the causal-sign of exertion. When the path is devoted exclusively to	1
tranquillity or is devoted exclusively to insight¹41, or when it combines both of these,	1
the impassive mental attention directed towards that which is defiled¹42 by the former	1
two secondary defilements is the causal-sign of equanimity. That which is adverse to	1
supremacy 143 which consists in the qualities such as the higher knowledges is unde-	1
filed nescience144 which consists in the obscuration to the attainments. Correct	1
meditative concentration [is the counteragent] to the third; [the word]	0
"""counteragent"" is to be supplied. As to why [it is the counteragent to the third], he"	1

says: because one achieves 145 the qualities such as the higher knowledges	0
with the meditative absorptions for a basis. For, meditative absorption is the	0
basis for the achievement of all the special qualities thus it is the counteragent to the	1
obscuration to the attainments 146, being adverse to the achievement of the qualities such	1
as the higher knowledges. Therefore, he has stated that: (a) dissociation from obscura-	1
tion that consists in moral defilement is by way of correct effort, (b) the complete	1
purification of meditative concentration is by way of correct mindfulness and (c)	1
separation from obscuration to the attainments 147 is by way of correct meditative	1
concentration.	1
h. The Differentiation 148 of the Meditative	1
Development of the Counteragent.	1
That meditative development of the counteragent should be known	1
summarily as threefold:	1
IV.11 cd & 12 ab	1
Meditative development as: (a) con-	1
formable but erroneously inverted,	1
(b) erroneous inversion accompanied	1
by connection and (c) not erro-	1
neously inverted and free from the	1
connection with erroneous inversion;	1
(a) Although erroneously inverted, it conforms with the absence of	1
erroneous inversion; (b) although not erroneously inverted, it is con-	1
nected with erroneous inversion; and (c) it is not erroneously inverted	1
and is free from connection with erroneous inversion. These relate	1
respectively to the state of: (i) ordinary people, (ii) those in training	1
and (iii) the adepts. However, for the bodhisattvas:	1
IV.12 cd	0
A distinction is made in terms of: (a)	1
objective support, (b) mental atten-	1
tion and (c) attainment.	1
For, the objective supports of the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas are	1
the body etc. belonging to their own mental continuum. [The objective	1

supports] for the bodhisattvas are [those things] belonging to their own	0
mental continuum as well as that of others. The śrävakas and pratyeka-	1
buddhas are mentally attentive of their body etc. in the aspects of	1
impermanence etc. However, the bodhisattvas [are mentally attentive]	1
in the manner of non-perception. The śrävakas and pratye kabuddhas	0
cultivate the applications of mindfulness etc. only insofar as they lead	1
to the dissociation of the body etc. The bodhisattvas do not (cultivate	1
the latter] for the purpose of dissociation, nor for non-dissociation,	1
[they cultivate them] up until the [attainment of the] nirvana in which	1
they are not permanently fixed.	1
The meditative development of the counteragent has now been	1
described.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
185.21 [1] That meditative development of the counteragent should be known	1
summarily as threefold, according to its differentiation as: (a) an undertaking, (b)	1
something obtained and (c) completion; however, in detail it is of various kinds. How	0
IV.11 c	0
[Meditative development as]: (a)	1
conformable but erroneously	0
inverted etc.	1
In this respect, (a) although erroneously inverted, it conforms with the	1
absence of erroneous inversion. The absence of erroneous inversion refers to	1
the path of vision because it has reality for its object and since it conforms with the	1
latter, it conforms with the absence of erroneous inversion. Moreover, this is the med-	1
itative development of ordinary people, thus, it is erroneously inverted because it	1
does not have reality for its object; i.e. because ordinary people have not relinquished	1
moral defilement in its entirety. How can it conform with the absence of erroneous	1
inversion when it is erroneously inverted? Because it has arisen¹49 from the latent	1
impressions of what is learnt which flows out of the extremely pure dharmadhātu.	1
And this begins with the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness	1
and concludes with the meditative development of the powers. (b) Although not	1
erroneously inverted, it is connected with erroneous inversion. This is	1
equivalent to the meditative development of the limbs of enlightenment and the medita-	1
tive development of the path, and is pertinent to those still in training. It is not	1
erroneously inverted because it has reality for its object and it is connected with erro-	1
neous inversion because of the presence of moral defilement which is to be relin-	1
quished through meditative development. (c) It is not erroneously inverted and	1
149 Read: utpannatvāt in place of utpannāt, Tib. byun ba'i phyir (D280a.3).Y187	0
is free from connection with erroneous inversion. This refers to the medita-	1
tive development of the path pertinent to the adepts, i.e. the arhats 150. It is not erro-	1
neously inverted because it has reality for its object; it is not connected with erroneous	1
inversion and is pertinent to the arhat because he has relinquished all stain.	1
[2] Now, in order to demonstrate the distinction between the meditative development	1
of the counteragent for the bodhisattvas in contrast to that of the śrāvakas etc., he says:	1
however, for the bodhisattvas:	1
IV.12 cd	0
A distinction is made in terms of: (a)	1
objective support, (b) mental atten-	1
tion and (c) attainment. 151	1
Therein, there is a distinction152 in terms of objective support, for, the objective	1
supports, i.e. the body, sensation, mind and the dharmas, of the śrävakas and	1
pratyekabuddhas are the body etc. with its own mental continuum.	1
However, the objective supports, i.e. the body, sensation, mind and the dharmas, for	1
the bodhisattvas are [those things] belonging to their own mental con-	0
tinuum as well as that of others. Why do they have different objective	1
supports? Because it is with reference to just their own benefit that the śråvakas etc.	1
engage in the meditative development of the counteragent; however, for the	1
bodhisattvas, it is with reference to both their own benefit and that of others. In the	1
aspects of impermanence etc.; i.e. in the aspects of the impermanent, the painful,	0
the empty and the insubstantial. Why is the mental attention of the śrävakas and	1
pratyekabuddhas [applied] thus in [the aspect of the impermanent etc.? In order to	1
generate aversion for the latter because one who is not averse does not dissociate from	1
them. The bodhisattvas [arementally attentive] in the manner of non-	1
perception; what is meant is: in the modes of the non-perception of the imaginary	1
nature. Why are they mentally attentive in this way? In order to relinquish all concep-	0
tual differentiation - this is said to be peculiar to them. Not only are they mentally atten-	1
tive in the manner of non-perception but also in the aspects of the impermanent etc.	1
Thus, a distinction is made because of the differences in their mental attention. Only	1
insofar as they lead to the dissociation of the body etc. The dissociation of	0
the body etc. refers to the nirvana without a remaining substratum and the relinquish-	1
ment of moral defilement which has it (i.e. the body) for its objective support. The	1
bodhisattvas do not [cultivate the latter] for the purpose of dissociation,	1
nor for non-dissociation. What is the reason? For, those who are absolutely	1
dissociated or not dissociated from the body etc. would not have the capacity to	1

provide benefit for sentient beings, just like those whose moral defilement has been	0
extinguished [i.e. who are absolutely dissociated] and ordinary beings [i.e. who are	1
absolutely non-dissociated]. If it leads neither to dissociation nor non-dissociation ¹53,	1
why then do they cultivate¹54 the counteragents? Hence he says: [they cultivate	1
them] on account of the fact that they lead to the attainment of the	1
nirväpa in which one is not permanently fixed 155. What is this nirvana [in	0
which the bodhisattva is] not permanently fixed? While [the aspirant] is in the	1
bodhisattva state since it is the basis for mastery over karma and rebirth - although he	1
is reborn in samsära on account of his compassion, he is without defilement there	1
owing to the strength of his wisdom. This is called 156 the unfixed nirvana of the the	1
bodhisattva. Although he is stationed in samsāra, he is not defiled like ordinary people	1
are, nor does he [attain] the nirvana devoid of substratum 157, like the śrävakas etc.	1
Moreover, in the tathāgata state he is not permanently fixed in samsåra because he has	1
relinquished the obscuration that consists in both moral defilement and the cognizable.	1
Nor is he permanently fixed in the nirvana devoid of a remaining substratum because	1
there is no interruption to the Dharma Body, for, as long as the world exists, he per-	1
forms benefit for others through the Enjoyment and Transformation Bodies. In this	1
way a distinction is made between the bodhisattva and the śrävaka etc. concerning the	1
meditative development of the counteragent according to differences in objective	1
support, mental attention and result. The meditative development of the	1
counteragent has now been described.	1

2. The State Therein.	1
Which are the states in regard to the latter?	1
IV.13 abcd	1
IV.14 abcd & 15 a	1
(a) The causal state, (b) that called	1
'arrival', those named: (c)	0
'preparatory' and (d) 'result', (e) that	1
with duties to be performed, (f)	0
without duties to be performed and	1
(g) that of excellence, (h) the super-	1
ior and (i) the unsurpassable.	1
[The states] are listed in relation to:	1
(a) firm conviction, (b) entry, (c) set-	1
ting forth, (d) prophecy, (e) teach-	1
ing, (f) consecration, (g) attainment,	1
(h) benefit and (i) performance of	1
duty.	1
Of these, (a) the causal state is that which pertains to an individual	1
stationed on a spiritual lineage. (b) The arrival state pertains to one	1
whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated. (c) The prepara-	1
tory state is subsequent to the generation of the resolve when the result	1
has not been attained. (d) The state of result [occurs when the latter]	1
has been attained. (e) The state with duties to be performed pertains to	1
one who is still in training. (f) The state without duties to be per-	1
formed pertains to the adept. (g) The state of excellence pertains to one	1
endowed with the special qualities of the higher knowledges etc. (h)	1
The superior state pertains to the bodhisattva who has entered the spiri-	1
tual levels above the śrävaka etc. (i) The unsurpassable state pertains	1
to the Buddha because there is no state that is superior to that.	1
(a) The state of firm conviction pertains to the bodhisattvas	1
on all	0
the spiritual levels consisting in the course of firm conviction.	1
(b) The	1
state of entry [pertains to those] on the first spiritual level.	1
(c) The	1
state of setting forth, on the six spiritual levels subsequent to the latter.	0
(d) The prophetic state, on the eighth spiritual level. (e) The state of	1
teacher, on the ninth. (f) The state of consecration, on the tenth. (g)	1
The attainment state refers to the Dharma Body of the Buddhas. (h)	1
The state of benefit refers to the Enjoyment Body. (i) The state of the	1
performance of duty refers to the Transformation Body.N57	1

Moreover, all of these various states, in short, should be known	1
Threefold in relation to the dharma-	0

IV.15 bed	0
Of these, (a) the impure state is inclusive of the causal state, up until	1
the preparatory. (b) The state that is both impure and pure pertains to	1
those still in training. (c) The purified state pertains to the adepts.	1
IV.16 ab	1
Hence is the respective establishment	1
of individuals considered, as is	1
fitting;	1
Hence, from the differentiation of their states, as is fitting, the	0
"establishment of individuals should be known in this way: ""this"	1
"[person] is stationed in a spiritual lineage; that [person] has arrived"""	1
etc. The states have now been described.	0
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] The state therein is described immediately following the meditative develop-	1
ment of the counteragent, hence he asks: which are 158 the states in regard to the	1
"latter? The words ""in regard to the latter"", signify: in regard to that meditative devel-"	1
opment of the counteragent; hence he says:	1
IV.13 a	0
(a) The causal state, (b) that called	1
'arrival' etc.	0
Of these, (a) the causal state is that which pertains to an individual	1
stationed in a spiritual lineage. What is meant is: the spiritual lineage is the	1
cause, i.e. the 'seed'. In this respect, one who abides in a spiritual lineage, but not	1
among those whose resolve has been generated, is the person who is meant in this	1
context as being stationed in a spiritual lineage; furthermore, such a one enters into the	1
higher states and does not turn back. Some [schools] claim that the spiritual lineage	1
has the root of the wholesome for its essential nature because certain roots of the	1
wholesome are said to consist in the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka and so forth, up	1
until certain others are said to consist in the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva. Others	1
again believe that, with reference to the state of the ordinary person159, the differentia-	1
tion of the faculties is said to consist in the spiritual lineage and they claim that the	1
spiritual lineage refers to a capacity of the 'seed' of mind. When this exists, then, in the	1

state of the ordinary person¹60 and in the state of the one still in training, it is described	0
as the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka and so forth up until its description as the spiri-	1
tual lineage of the bodhisattva. However, one who is in the state of the adept is	1
described as a śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha or a Buddha161 and there is no spiritual	1
lineage on his part because of his pre-eminent state. Moreover, that [i.e. the spiritual	1
lineage] is differentiated as threefold according to one's differentiation as śrāvaka etc.	1
and is sixfold according to its differentiation as determinate and indeterminate 162.	1
[2] (b) The arrival state pertains to one whose resolve for enlightenment	1
has been generated. Such a person can be one of three types belonging respec-	1
tively to either the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha or the tathāgata	1
because he generates the resolve for the enlightenment 163 of either the śrävaka, the	1
pratyekabuddha or the Perfectly Enlightened One. Since he arrives in the preparatory	1
[state] when the latter has originated, because it consists in the roots of preparation, its	0
generation is described as the state of arrival in preparation. (c) The preparatory	1
state is subsequent to the generation of the resolve, when the result has	1
not been attained. It is described as preparatory since, for one whose resolve for	1
enlightenment164 has been generated, it is the expedient which causes the attainment of	1
the first result by practising the wholesome roots 165, beginning with generosity and	1
morality and terminating in the meditative development of the powers. Why are the	1
causal and arrival states described as the states that comprise the meditative develop-	1
ment of the factors that contribute to enlightenment? Because they are causes of the	1
latter. Only because of this is it said that the generation of the resolve due to the spiri-	1
tual lineage has ever increasing results etc.166. (d) The state of result [occurs	1
when the latter] has been attained; i.e. when the first result [has been attained]	1
for preparation is undertaken for the sake of the result; hence, the state of result follows	1
immediately after the preparatory [state]. (e) The state with duties to be per-	1
formed pertains to one still in training167 because he has not completely	1
attained the results since there are duties still to be performed for the attainment of the	1
other results 168. (f) The state without duties to be performed pertains to	1

the adept. For, he is an adept insofar as being free from the passion that pertains to	0
the three realms of existence. It is the state without duties to be performed because	1
such a one has completely attained the results since there are no duties still to be per-	1
formed for the attainment of the other results. (g) The state of excellence	1
pertains to one endowed with the special qualities of the higher knowl-	1
edges etc. When there is the state of an arhat, one is endowed with the special quali-	1
ties such as the higher knowledges, [therefore], the state of the perfection of the special	1
qualities of the higher knowledges etc. is distinguished from other [states] and is	1
described as the state of excellence. (h) The superior state pertains to the	1
bodhisattva who has entered the spiritual levels above the śrävaka and	1
pratyekabuddhal69. Owing to the acquisition of the supramundane path which	0
penetrates 170 both the insubstantialities and is occupied with benefit for oneself and	1
others, the state of the latter is described as the superior state because it is superior to	1
other vehicles. (i) The unsurpassable state pertains to the Buddha. What is	1
the reason?171 He says: ...because there is no state subsequent to that. It	1
pertains to the Buddha [state] because this is the final basis 172 for the excellence and	1
absence of all virtues and faults [respectively]. It is described as unsurpassable	1
because another state of excellence subsequent to this cannot be found.	1
[3] Although [the explanation of the states in their entirety is complete because of	1
what has been discussed so far, in order to demonstrate the differentiation of the eleven	1
spiritual levels of the bodhisattva, the states beginning with the course of 173 firm con-	1
viction and terminating in the state of consecration etc. 174, are now described. How-	1
ever, in order to demonstrate the differentiation of the three Buddha Bodies, the three	1
beginning with the attainment state are also explained. In the above, the causal and	0
arrival states are to be known as being common to both bodhisattvas and others 175.	1
(a) The state of firm conviction pertains to the bodhisattvas on all the	1
spiritual levels that consists in the course of firm conviction. In this	1
regard, subsequent to the generation of the resolve [for enlightenment] and before his	1
entry to the spiritual levels, although [the aspirant] has not perceived reality, it is as	1
though he has perceived reality, [for] he comprehends the dharmas by way of the three	1
natures on account of his firm conviction in the Buddhas and the bodhisattvas. He is	1
intent upon the resources for the achievement of Buddhahood, i.e. generosity and	1
morality etc., which are difficult to perform for other sentient beings, thus this is	1

described as the course of firm conviction because it is characterized by the state of	0
firm resolve. Moreover, this 176 [continues] for countless aeons or more. (b) The	1
state of entry [pertains to the bodhisattva] on the first spiritual level; it	1
is described as the state of entry because, from the very beginning, through the direct	1
intuition of the three natures that is devoid of conceptual differentiation he has the	1
intuitive knowledge and penetration of reality. This same [level] is the path of vision	1
of the bodhisattva. (c) The state of setting forth, on the six spiritual levels	1
subsequent to the latter; these spiritual levels are described¹77 as the state of	1
setting forth because [the bodhisattva]: (a) reaches the end of the relinquishment of	0
notional attachment to the multiplicity of signs (nimitta) which is to be relinquished	1
through meditative development and (b) reaches the end of preparation that is accom-	1
panied by deliberate effort178. (d) The prophetic state, on the eighth¹7	1
spiritual level; due to the absence of deliberate effort 130 and conceptualization in	1
regard to all signs in every respect on the eighth level, it is prophesized through an	1
open prophecy by the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, that Buddhahood is certain. (e)	1
The state of teacher¹81, on the ninth; on the ninth level he obtains the four	1
analytical knowledges which are distinctly superior to [those of the śrävakas and	1
pratyekabuddhas and becomes an unsurpassable teacher of the universal Dharma. (f)	0
The state of consecration, on the tenth spiritual level182; for, on the tenth	1
level the bodhisattva has reached the end of the path and is consecrated by anointment	1
with rays of light from the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, who are stationed in the	1
world spheres of the ten directions. (g) The attainment state refers to the	1
Dharma Body of the Buddhas. It is the Dharma Body of the Buddhas since it:	1
(a) has the nature of the turning about of the basis, (b) has control over all dharmas and	1
(c) is without a foundation these are due to both the relinquishment of all obscuration	1
and the accumulation of the 'seeds' of all dharmas that are without impurity and which	1
act as counteragent to those [obscurations]. It is described as the attainment state	1
because by means of this [body the bodhisattva] reaches the culminating point in his	1
penetration of the dharmas. However, others claim that the extremely pure dharma-	1
dhātu is [equivalent to] the Dharma Body which is the Body of real nature	1
(dharmatākāya)183 because of the removal of adventitious stain in its entirety. Others	1

again believe that the Dharma Body consists in a distinctive direct intuition which	0
proceeds without attachment or hindrance in regard to everything knowable184. (h)	1
The state of benefit refers to the Enjoyment body. The Essential Nature	1
[Body] is the body established in which he becomes perfectly enlightened 185. The	1
Enjoyment Body is that body on account of which one experiences the Recitation of	1
the Dharma in the circle of assembly 186 together with the bodhisattvas who have	1
reached their final end. (i) The state of the performance of duty refers to the	1
Transformation Body ¹87. The Transformation Body is that which: (a) has the	1
Essential Nature Body for a basis, (b) takes heed of the aspirations of sentient beings	1
and (c) has infinite divisions in regard to the engagement in undertakings188 for the	1
sake of those to be trained.	1
[4] Moreover, all of these various states, in short, should be known as:	1
IV.15 b	0
Threefold in relation to the dharma-	1
thăm etc.	0
As to how this can be, he says:	1
IV.15 cd	0
(a) impure, (b) impure and pure and	1
(c) purified, as is appropriate. 189	1
Of these, (a) the impure state is inclusive of the causal state up until 190	1
the preparatory; i.e. the states of cause, arrival, preparation and firm conviction are	0
included. In relation to these states, the impure state is so-called because the stain of	1
the dharmadhatu has not been relinquished in its entirety. (b) The state that is	1
both impure and pure pertains to those who are still in training; and in	1
this context, the states of result, that with duties still to be performed 191, distinction,	1
superiority, entry, setting forth, prophecy, teacher and consecration are included.	1
Moreover, in relation to these states, the state that is both impure and pure is so-called	1
because the moral defilement of the dharmadhātu is both relinquished and not relin-	1
quished. (c) The purified state pertains to the adepts; i.e. the states without	1
duties still to be performed, distinction, superiority, attainment, benef and the perfor-	0
mance of duty are described as the purified state because the adepts have relinquished	1
moral defilement in its entirety.	1

preferred; cf. his fn.1 p.192.	1
[5] Furthermore, these states are respectively determined as being pertinent to: (a)	1
ordinary people, (b) those still in training and (c) the adepts. And as to the way in	1
which their various respective establishments should be discerned, he says:	1
IV.16 ab	0
Hence is the establishment of indi-	1
viduals 192 considered, as is fitting;	1
"By ""as is fitting"" [is meant] according to circumstances. By ""hence"" is meant: as the"	0
"consequence of this differentiation of the states. In this way: ""this [person] is"	1
"established in a spiritual lineage; that [person] has arrived and so on"""	1
"Because of the reference to the word ""etc."", [the following possible differentiation of"	0
individuals is understood]: this [person] has made preparation; ...has won the stream;	1
...is a once-returner; ...is a non-returner; ...is an arhat, ...possesses ornaments; ...is a	1
bodhisattva; ...is a tathāgata; ...courses in firm conviction; ...courses in a pure higher193	1

3. The Attainment of the Result.	1
Which are the results that are attained?	1
IV.16 cd	1
The results respectively are: (a) the	1
fit vessel known as the karma-result,	1
(b) strength because of the influence	0
of the latter, (c) inclination, (d)	1
growth and (e) purification.	0
(a) The fit vessel refers to the karma-result that conforms with the	1
wholesome. (b) Strength which is [equivalent to] a preponderance of	0
the wholesome is due to the influence of the fit vessel. (c) Inclination	1
refers to the inclination towards the wholesome that is due to previous	1
practice. (d) Growth refers to the nourishment of the root of the	1
wholesome which is due to practice in regard to the wholesome dharmas	1
in the present. (e) Purification refers to the relinquishment of obscura-	1
tion. These fivefold results are to be known respectively as: (a) the	1
karma-result, (b) the influenced result, (c) the result as natural outcome,	1
(d) the result of human effort and (e) the result of dissociation.	1
IV.17 cd & 18 abcd	1
The other results are, in brief: (a) the	1
ever increasing, (b) the first, (c) due	1
to the practice of the latter, (d) due	1
to completion, (e) due to conformity,	1
(f) due to adverse elements, (g) due	1
to dissociation, (h) due to excel-	1
lence, (i) due to superiority and (j)	1
due to unsurpassability.	1
(a) The ever increasing result is to be understood as	1
a successive	1
development, i.e. the generation of the resolve is due to the spiritual	1
lineage, and so on. (b) The first result refers to the acquisition, from	1
the very beginning, of the supramundane dharmas. (c) The result of	1
practice follows after the latter in the state of one still in training. (d)	0
The completion result refers to the qualities of the adept. (e) The con-	1
forming result is to be known as the ever increasing result in its causal	1
mode. (f) The result of the adverse elements is [equivalent to the path	1
of relinquishment and is [to be known as the first result; [the adverseN58	1
elements are intended as counteragent¹94. (g) The dissociation-result,	1
i.e. the direct realization of cessation195, consists in both the result of	1
practice and completion result and refers to the dissociation from moral	1
defilement on the part of one still in training and the adept, respec-	1
tively. (h) The excellent result refers to the special qualities such as the	1
higher knowledges. (i) The superior result refers to the spiritual levels	1
of the bodhisattva because these are superior to the other vehicles. (j)	1
The unsurpassable result refers to the spiritual level of the Buddhas.	1
The latter four are divisions of the above-mentioned practice and com-	1
pletion results. The other results are [explained] by way of a	1
condensed explanation but in full detail they are immeasurable.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y192.19 [1] Since the state precedes the result, in order to comment on the result immediately	1
after the states, he asks: which are the results that are attained? Hence he says:	1
IV.16 c	1
...(a) The fit vessel known as the	1
karma-result etc.	1
In brief, the result is fivefold: (a) the fit vessel, (b) strength, (c) inclination, (d) growth	1
and (e) purification. Of these, (a) the fit vessel refers to the karma-result that	1
conforms with the wholesome. Now, that which consists in: (a) the relinquish-	1
ment of the eight inopportune births, (b) the six sense-fields distinguished as impure	1
and (c) the karma-result of the dharmas that contribute to enlightenment, is described as	0
the fit vessel because it is the basis for the production of all wholesome dharmas. (b)	1
Strength which is [equivalent to a preponderance of the root196 of the	1
wholesome, what is meant is: a thriving condition, ...is due to the influence of	0
the fit vessel; i.e. it is on account of the feeble production of moral defilement on the	1
part of the basis [i.e. the physical body]197 - this is described as strength. (c) Incli-	1
nation198 refers to the inclination towards the wholesome which is due	1
to previous practice 199. Due to the practice of the wholesome dharmas in previous	1
lives, there is a tendency towards [the practice of] wholesome dharmas in the present	1
life, according to the analogy of a river and its currents 200 - this is inclination. (d)	1
Growth refers to the nourishment of the root of the wholesome201 - thus	1

is the intended meaning which is due to the practice of the dharmas that	0
consist in the root202 of the wholesome in the present203, i.e. the production	1
of excellent wholesome dharmas that were non-existent in the past. This is the differ-	1
ence between strength and growth, for strength consists in firmness in regard to the	1
karma-result of the feeble wholesome [dharmas]204. Whereas, growth refers to the	1
ever increasing excellence in wholesome (dharmas]. Others again believe that in this	1
"context, the statement: ""the nourishment of the root of the wholesome"", is intended to"	1
signify the nourishment of the latent impressions of the excellent wholesome dharmas.	1
(e) Purification refers to the relinquishment of obscuration. For those	1
who belong to the spiritual lineages of the śrävaka and the pratyeka buddha, purifica-	1
tion, in this regard, refers to the relinquishment of obscuration that consists moral	1
defilement; but for those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva205,	0
purification refers to the relinquishment of both the obscuration that consists moral	1
defilement as well as the cognizable.	0
[2] These fivefold results are [to be known] respectively as: (i) the	1
karma-result; i.e. the karma-result that is conformable with the wholesome dharmas.	1
(ii) The influenced result; i.e. the preponderance of wholesome [dharmas] that is	1
due to the influence of the fit vessel. (iii) The result as natural outcome; i.e. the	1
inclination towards the wholesome that is due to previous practice. (iv) The result	1
of human effort; i.e. the nourishment of the root of the wholesome that is due to the	1
practice of the wholesome dharmas in the present. (v) The result of dissociation;	1
i.e. the relinquishment of obscuration.	1
[3] The division of these fivefold results that have been mentioned briefly, is now	1
explained in brief:	1
IV.17 C	1
[The other results are, in brief]: (a)	1
the ever increasing, (b) the first 206	1
(a) The ever increasing result is to be known as a successive develop-	1
ment of the states as described above, i.e. the generation of the resolve is due	1
to the spiritual lineage, the preparatory [state] is due to the generation of the	1
resolve, and so on. (b) The first result refers to the acquisition, from the	0
very beginning, of the supramundane dharmas; i.e. the attainment of the path	1
of vision. (c) The result of practice follows after the latter in the state of	1
202 müla is omitted from the Bhasya; cf. N57.12.	0
Y:pratyutpanne, which accords with the Bhasya (N57.12) and with both Tib. eds. of the Bhaşya	1
as well as P Tika (cf. 130b.4); however, D(283b.6): da Ita byuń ba- supports the Ms.(61a.3)	1
reading of pratyutpanna-.	1

one still in training207; i.e. the results pertinent to both the once-returner and the	0
non-returner in the state of one who is still in training which is comprised of the five	1
individuals and is subsequent to the path of vision. It is the result of practice because it	1
consists in the path of meditative development which is subsequent to that [state]	1
accompanied by preparation. (d) The completion result refers to the qualities	1
of the adept. Now, these are called: correct view, correct intention, correct speech,	1
correct action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness, correct meditative	1
concentration as well as liberation and insight into the direct intuition that constitutes	0
liberation. It is described as the completion result because it is situated at the end of all	1
the results. (e) The conforming result is to be known as the ever increas-	1
ing result in its causal mode. The causal mode (upanișadbhāva) is [equivalent	1
to] the cause (hetu)208; i.e. because the generation of the resolve therein conforms with	1
the spiritual lineage, the generation of the resolve is [the conforming] result209. It	1
should be known that there are separate respective teachings, by way of statement and	1
explanation, for the ever increasing result etc. and the conforming result etc. (f) The	1
result of the adverse elements is [equivalent to the path of relinquish-	1
ment and is [to be known as] the first result210; because the adverse elements	1
themselves are the result, this is [described as] the result of the adverse elements on	1
account of which the path of relinquishment becomes dissociated from moral defile-	1
"ment. The first result is that which was mentioned previously as: ""the acquisition,"	1
"from the beginning, of the supramundane dharmas"". Although the term ""adverse"	1
"element"" (vipakşa) is [often] described as an obscuration in the sense that it is a"	1
hindrance to the counteragent, in this context, the adverse elements are intended	1
as the counteragent211, for the word can be analysed in this way: the adverse	1
(vipakṣa) is the side (pakşa) that impedes (vi-ghātana) 212 obscuration. (g) The	0
dissociation-result consists in both the result of practice and comple-	1
tion-result and refers to the dissociation from moral defilement on the	1
part of one still in training and the adept, respectively. Dissociation as the	1
result of practice pertains to the five still in training, beginning with the once-returner's	1
entry into the result, because they possess residual moral defilement213. Dissocia-	1

tion214 as the completion result pertains to the six adepts, beginning with the one	1
susceptible to fall215, because these have relinquished all moral defilement belonging to	1
the three realms of existence, without remainder. The above [results] have been	1
described by way of their differentiation, now the excellent [result is described] since it	1
is not differentiated: (h) the excellent result refers to the special qualities	1
such as the higher knowledges216. This should be understood just as the excel-	1
lence of the practice and completion results217. What is the reason? Because	1
[Vasubandhu] has in mind the acquisition of the special qualities on the part of the	1
non-returners, the arhats, the pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattvas, and the tathāgatas.	1
(i) The superior result refers to the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva218;	1
here he provides the reason: because these are superior to the other	1
vehicles 219. Even though the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva consist in both the	0
first result and the result of practice, because these have the natures of the paths of	0
vision and meditative development, nevertheless, in relation to the śrävaka and pratyeka-	1
buddha vehicles, the superior result is to be known to pertain to the spiritual levels 220	1
of the bodhisattva because: (a) it is devoid of conceptual differentiation, (b) it belongs	1
to the spiritual lineage of the Buddhas and (c) it is the result of universal enlighten-	1
ment 221. j) The unsurpassable result refers to the spiritual level of the	1
Buddhas. This consists only in the completion result since it is due to the relin-	1
quishment of all moral defilement and secondary defilement together with their latent	1
impressions, and is also due to the relinquishment of undefiled nescience. It is	1
described as the unsurpassable result because there is no other spiritual level222 that is	1
superior to it.	1
[4] The other results are [explained] by way of a condensed explana-	1
tion, however in full detail they are immeasurable223. In full detail, the	1
results that are set forth pertinent to the śrävakas, the pratyekabuddhas, the bodhi-	1
sattvas and the Perfectly Enlightened Ones are immeasurable.	1

Development of the Counteragent, the State	1
Therein and the Result.	0
The summary meaning of the meditative development of the counter-	1

learning, (b) the meditative development of abstinence, (c) the medita-	1
tive development of the necessary preparation, (d) the meditative devel-	1
opment of higher enterprise, (e) the connected meditative development	1
because of the connection with the path of vision, (f) the meditative	1
development of entry, (g) the superior meditative development, (h) the	1
meditative development of the beginning, (i) the meditative development	1
of the middle, (j) the meditative development of the end, (k) the higher	1
meditative development, (1) the unsurpassable meditative development	1
which is distinguished in terms of objective support, mental attention	1
and attainment.	1
The summary meaning of the state consists in: (a) the future state of	1
one stationed in the spiritual lineage, (b) the state of undertaking, up	1
until the preparatory [state] 224, (c) the impure state, (d) the impure and	1
pure state, (e) the purified state, (f) the state accompanied by ornamen-	1
tation, (g) the pervading state because it pervades the ten spiritual	1
levels and (h) the unsurpassable state.	1

(a) aggregation, (b) the distinction of the latter, (c) previous practice,	1
(d) ever increasing accomplishment, (e) statements and (f) explanations.	1
Of these, (a) that which is due to the aggregation refers to the five	1

the karma-result. (d) That which is due to ever increasing accomplish-	1
ment refers to the other four. (e) That which is due to statements refers	1
to the four beginning with the ever increasing result. (f) That which is	1
due to explanations refers to the six beginning with the conforming	1
result because these are the explanations of the latter four.	1
Both the Tib. Bhãşya (D196.5) and Tika have a different rendering to that given here; cf.	1
Nagao's fn.7 p.58.[Sthiramati]	1
Y196.2 [1] The summary meaning of the meditative development of the counter-	1
agent consists in: (a) the meditative development of comprehensive	1
learning; i.e. the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness due to	1
comprehensive learning in regard to the four noble truths. (b) The meditative	1
development of abstinence; i.e. the meditative development of the correct exer-	1
tions due to abstinence from unwholesome dharmas. (c) The meditative devel-	1
opment of the necessary preparation; i.e. the meditative development of the	1
bases of psychic power, for these facilitate the necessary preparation for meditative	1
concentration because one's devotion to the eight formative forces that facilitate relin-	1
quishment leads to the relinquishment of the five faults. (d) The meditative	1
development of higher enterprise; i.e. the meditative development of the	0
faculties that results from the generation of the root of the wholesome which is con-	1
ducive to liberation. (e) The connected meditative development 225; i.e. the	1
meditative development of the powers226 because of the connection with the	1
path of vision. (f) The meditative development of entry; the meditative	1
development of the limbs of enlightenment because therein one enters into reality 227,	1
either due to entry into the supramundane dharmas, or else, due to entry into the Noble	1
Path²28. (g) The superior meditative development; i.e. the meditative devel-	1
opment [component] of the path because the path of meditative development is superior	1
to the path of vision. (h) The meditative development of the beginning 229;	1
i.e. in the state of the ordinary person it is either conformable, or else, erroneously	0
inverted. (i) The meditative development of the middle; i.e. in the state of one	1
still in training it is not erroneously inverted but is encumbered by erroneous inver-	1
sion 230. (j) The meditative development of the end; i.e. in the state of the	1
adept it is not erroneously inverted and is free from the encumbrance of erroneous	1
inversion. (k) The higher meditative development231; i.e. that pertinent to the	1
śrāvaka etc. (1) The unsurpassable meditative development232; i.e. that perti-	1
nent to the bodhisattva, which is distinguished in terms of objective	1
support, mental attention and attainment. The summary meaning of meditative	1
development has now been set forth233.	1

[2] The summary meaning of the state consists in: (a) the future state;	1
i.e. the causal state. (b) The state of undertaking refers to preparation	1
together with the generation of the resolve234. (c) The impure and pure	1
state; i.e. the two states: the state of result and the state of duties still to be performed.	0
(d) The purified state; i.e. the state without duties still to be performed. (e) The	1
state accompanied by ornamentation; i.e. the state of excellence. (f) The per-	1
vading state; i.e. the higher state it is described as the pervading state because it	1
pervades the ten spiritual levels of the bodhisattvas. (g) The unsurpassable	1
state; i.e. that of the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, for there is no other state superior	0
to it. And this refers to the attainment state, the state of benefit and 235 the state of the	1
performance of duty, which have been previously described.	1
[3] The summary meaning of the result consists in those that are due to:	1
(a) the aggregation, (b) the distinction of the latter, (c) previous	1
practice, (d) ever increasing accomplishment, (e) statements and (f)	1
explanations. The author of the commentary himself provides an exposition of	0
these of these, (a) that which is due to aggregation refers to the five	1
results; i.e. those beginning with the karma-result since all the results are included in	1
these. (b) That which is due to the distinction of the latter refers to the	1
remaining [results]; i.e. the differentiation of those same five. The remaining	1
[results] should be known as those beginning with the ever increasing result. (c)	1
That which is due to previous practice refers to the karma-result; i.e. the	1
karma-result in the present life which is due to the accumulation of wholesome	1
[dharmas] in past lives. Since it arises in conformity with the wholesome, it is	1
described as being due to previous practice. (d) That which is due to ever	1
increasing accomplishment refers to the other four; i.e. the influenced result,	1
the result as natural outcome, the result of human effort and the result of dissociation.	1
In relation to these, strength refers to what is accomplished through the karma-result;	1
inclination refers to what is accomplished through strength; growth refers to what is	1
accomplished through inclination; purification refers to what is accomplished through	1
growth. Some believe it is described as an ever increasing accomplishment because it	1
is characterized by successive expositions. (e) That which is due to statements	1
refers to the four beginning with the ever increasing result; i.e. the ever	1
increasing result, the first result, the result of practice and the completion-result. (f)	1
That which is due to explanations refers to the six beginning with the	1
conforming result because these are the explanations of the latter	1

increasing result; the result of adverse elements is [equivalent to] the explanation of the	1
first result; the result of dissociation is [equivalent to] the explanation of both the result	1
of practice and the completion-result. And the excellent result, the superior result and	1
the unsurpassable result are [equivalent to] the explanation of that same completion-	1
result because [Vasubandhu] has in mind the possession of ornamentation on its part.	1
However, others believe237 that the excellent result is {equivalent to] just the explana-	1

also [to possess] the qualities of the higher knowledges etc., whereas, the unsurpass-	1
able result is [equivalent to] the explanations of the completion-result.	1

The Supremacy of the VehicleN60.3	1
1. The Three Kinds of Supremacy.	1
The supremacy of the vehicle should now be mentioned it is said:	1
V.1 abc	0
Supremacy is considered as listed in	1
relation to: (a) spiritual practice, (b)	1
objective support and (c) full attain-	1
ment.	1
The threefold supremacies which are [incorporated] in the universal	1
vehicle and on account of which it is the supreme vehicle are: (a)	1
supremacy of spiritual practice, (b) supremacy of objective support and	1
(c) supremacy of full attainment.	1
[2] Alternatively, the Meditative Development of the Counteragent, the State Therein	1
and the Attainment of the Result were explained as common to both the śrävaka etc.	1
and the bodhisattva; however, because they do not share the same states³, the	1
supremacy of the vehicle is not common to both the bodhisattva and the śrāvaka etc.	1
And in order to demonstrate that it is described as the chief object in this context, he	1
"says: ""the supremacy of the vehicle should now be mentioned it is said:..."". Since"	1
there is nothing higher than this, the word 'supremacy' is a synonym for 'excellence'.	1
But what is this? It is the universal vehicle, for thus, inasmuch as the universal vehicle	1
is superior to both the śrävaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles, there is none other that is	1
more excellent compared with the universal vehicle because of the proportional differ-	1
ences in cause and result in regard to it. Supremacy (ānuttarya) refers to the state	1
(bhava) of that which is supreme (anuttarasya); but just what is this? Hence he says:	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] The supremacy of the vehicle was [initially] listed immediately after the listing of	1
the six subjects, such as the Characteristics and the Obscurations2; hence, subsequent	1
to the explanation of these, the subject under discussion is the explanation of the	1
Supremacy of the Vehicle. Consequently, he says: the supremacy of the vehicle	1
"should now be mentioned it is said:... The [word] ""now"" means"	1
"""immediately following the explanation of the six [subjects] such as the Characteristic""."	1
The intended meaning is: because it was listed immediately after those [subjects].	1
Tib. omits yāna; cf. D20a.2.	1
Tib. omits avaraṇa; cf. D287a.6.	1
Read perhaps: asādhāraṇāvasthātaḥ in place of asādhāraṇaprasangena on the basis of the Tib.:	1

taryan tu...Y200	1
V.1 a	1
Supremacy [is considered as listed]	1
in relation to: (a) spiritual practice4	1
[3] Alternatively, the universal vehicle refers to the direct intuition devoid of all the	1
discursive elaboration of conceptual discrimination in accompaniment with its associ-	1
ated elements, the accumulations, application, subsequently attained direct intuition, the	1
special qualities, objective support and result. Of these, the objective support refers to	0
thusness; the result refers to the nirvāṇa in which the bodhisattva is not permanently	1
fixed. And the universal vehicle refers to the teachings such as the Sütras which are	1
expressive of this universal vehicle. Moreover, the [name of the] text is applied figur-	1
"atively for its subject matter, just as the ""Slaying of Kamsa"" is [figuratively used] for"	1
The threefold supremacies which are [incorporated in the universal	0
vehicle...5 But what is this universal vehicle? Just these three: (a) spiritual prac-	1
tice, (b) objective support and (c) full attainment. Of these, (a) the	1
supremacy of spiritual practice refers to the accomplishment of the ten perfections, i.e.	1
the spiritual practice of the bodhisattva is described as supreme in regard to the accom-	1
plishment of the perfections. (b) Moreover, the objective support refers to the dharmas	1
of the perfections etc. and to the dharmadhâtu. By means of this objective support, the	1
bodhisattvas have the capacity to provide benefit without remainder for others6; hence,	1
the supremacy of objective support refers to its being the cause of the capacity to pro-	1
vide benefit for others. Why? This the objective support of the bodhisattvas is	1
described as supreme because it belongs to him. (c) Full attainment refers to the result	1
of: (i) the spiritual lineage, (ii) firm conviction and (iii) the generation of the resolve	1
[for enlightenment] etc. Since the [bodhisattva] reaches full knowledge	0
[samudāgacchanti] or attains this due to the spiritual lineage etc., it is [described as] full	1
attainment (samudāgama]; and it is described as supreme because there is no other full	1
attainment superior to this. Consequently, in this context, supremacy refers to the	1
absence of anything other that is superior to that full attainment. And in this respect, it	1
is said that the spiritual practice of the bodhisattvas, together with its foundation and	1
results, consists in the universal vehicle. Moreover, it is described as supreme on	1
account of the threefold supremacy that has just been described.	1

the 'stealing of jewels'9. It is universal (mahat) because it possesses the seven kinds of	0
universality; it is a vehicle (yāna) since [the bodhisattva) reaches the unfixed nirvāṇa	1
travelling (yanti) by means of it. Since it is both a vehicle and is universal, it is the	1
universal vehicle 10. Furthermore, its sevenfold universality refers to universality in	1
regard to: (a) objective support, (b) spiritual practice, (c) direct intuition, (d) vigour, (e)	1
expedients, (f) attainment and (g) action. Of these, (a) the universality in regard to	1
objective support refers to the Dharma of the endless Sutras, such as the Hundred	1
Thousand [Prajñāpāramitā], for these form the objective support for the path of the	1
bodhisattva. (b) The universality in regard to spiritual practice is the result of spiritual	1
practice concerned with benefit in its entirety for both oneself and others. (c) The	1
universality in regard to direct intuition is due to knowledge of insubstantiality in	1
regard to the personal entity and the dharmas. (d) The universality in regard to vigour	1
is due to application in regard to the many hundreds of thousands of difficult tasks [to	1
be performed] over three countless aeons. (e) The universality in regard to skill in	1
expedients is due to the fact that [the bodhisattva] is fixed neither in samsāra nor	1
nirvāņa. (f) The universality in regard to attainment is due to the understanding of the	1
immeasurable and countless virtues, such as the powers, self-confidence and the	1
special Buddha qualities. (g) The universality in regard to actions is due to the perfor-	1
mance of the acts of the Buddha by revealing his enlightenment for as long as samsāra	1
exists. Only this universal vehicle is supreme; the state of the latter is [described as]	1
supremacy because there is no vehicle that is superior to it. Furthermore, it consists	1
in spiritual practice, objective support and full attainment, for thus, the universal vehicle	1
is described as supreme because it possesses these [three] elements. There is	1
supremacy of spiritual practice since spiritual practice supreme; the supremacy of	1
objective support and the supremacy of full attainment should be understood in the	1
same way. These supremacies are respectively determined with reference to: (a) the	1
path of the bodhisattva, (b) its support and (c) the result of that [path]. Moreover, it is	1
just these that are referred to through the statements of the Buddha, viz.: spiritual prac-	1
tice, objective support and the result of that (practice).	1
It difficult to establish the full significance of this analagy; perhaps it refers to the	1
appropriation of Kamsa's wealth etc. by Krşna after he had killed him.	1

These are the six kinds of spiritual practice, namely: (a) the highest	0
spiritual practice, (b) spiritual practice in regard to mental attention, (c)	1
spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma, (d) spiritual practice	1
that avoids the two extremes, (e) specific spiritual practice and (f) non-	1
specific spiritual practice.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y201.12 [1] Although it is fitting that the objective support be explained firstly because spiritual	1
practice is preceded by the objective support, spiritual practice is mentioned initially in	1
order to demonstrate that it is the essence of the practice of the bodhisattvas. Of	1
these, how is the supremacy of spiritual practice [to be known]? Hence he says: the	1
supremacy of spiritual practice is to be known by way of the practice of	1
the ten perfections. The spiritual practice of the perfections is [equivalent to] the	1
performance of the perfections; and since this spiritual practice of the perfections is	1
explained only in the universal vehicle and not in any other vehicle¹2, he shows the	1
universal vehicle to be supreme. Moreover, this spiritual practice becomes supreme	1
while [the bodhisattva] is applying himself to the perfections in their various modes;	1
and in order to illustrate these modes, he says:	1

a. The Highest Spiritual Practice.	1
The highest consists in twelve:	1
(a) Magnanimity, (b) duration, (c)	1
prerogative, (d) inexhaustibility, (e)	1
continuity, (f) non-hardship, (g)	1
wealth and (h) possession;	0
(i) Enterprise, (j) acquisition, (k)	1
natural outcome and (1) accom-	0
plishment these are considered as	1
highest.	0
These twelve types are considered as highest, namely: (a) the highest	1
degree of magnanimity, (b) the highest degree of duration, (c) the high-	1
est degree of prerogative, (d) the highest degree of inexhaustibility, (e)	1
the highest degree of continuity, (f) the highest degree of non-hardship,	1
(g) the highest degree of wealth, (h) the highest degree of possession,	1
(i) the highest degree of enterprise, (j) the highest degree of acquisi-	1
tion, (k) the highest degree of natural outcome and (1) the highest	1
degree of accomplishment.	1
Of these, (a) the highest degree of magnanimity is to be known as	1
not seeking after all mundane success and also as pre-eminence. (b)	1
The highest degree of duration is due to the cultivation [of the perfec-	1
tions] for three countless aeons. (c) The highest degree of prerogative	1
is due to the prerogative for deeds of benefit for all beings.	1
(d) The	1
highest degree of inexhaustibility is due to the complete absence of	1
exhaustion on account of the transformation into universal enlighten-	1
ment. (e) The highest degree of continuity is due to a firm conviction	1
in the sameness of self and others due to the fulfilment of the perfec-	1
tions of generosity etc. in regard to all beings. (f) The highest degree	1
of non-hardship is due to the fulfilment of the perfections of generosity	1
etc. on the part of others, through his approval alone. (g) The highest	1
degree of wealth is due to the fulfilment of generosity etc. by means of	1
"the ""treasury of the sky"" meditative concentration etc. (h) The highest"	1
degree of possession is due to the possession [by the bodhisattva] of	1
direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differentiation. (i) The	1
highest degree of enterprise refers to the abundant measure of patience	1
on the spiritual level of the one who courses in firm conviction. (j) The№62	1
highest degree of acquisition refers to the first spiritual level. (k) The	1
highest degree of natural outcome refers to the eight spiritual levels	1
subsequent to the latter. (1) The highest degree of accomplishment	1
refers to the tenth spiritual level and to that of the tathāgata since these	1
are the [respective] accomplishments of (a) the bodhisattva and (b) the	1
Buddhas.	1

Consequently, the ten perfections are	1
considered in the highest sense;	1
Since these twelvefold [spiritual practices] exist in the highest	0
degree within the latter [i.e. the perfections], consequently, the ten per-	1
fections [are considered]¹3 in this sense, i.e. as highest. As to which	1
are these ten and in order to disclose their names, it is said:	1
V.5 abcd	0
(a) Generosity, (b) morality, (c)	1
patience, (d) vigour, (e) meditative	1
absorption, (f) wisdom, (g) expedi-	1
ency, (h) vows, (i) strength and (j)	1
direct intuition these are the ten	0
perfections.	1
Which are the individual actions pertinent to each of these?	1
V.6 abcdef	1
Actions that: (a) are of assistance,	1
(b) are non-violent, (c) endure such	1
[violence], (d) increase virtues, (e)	1
have the capacity to initiate and (f)	1
to liberate, (g) are inexhaustible, (h)	1
engage constantly [in generosity] (i)	1
engage eternally in [generosity], (j)	1
are enjoyable and bring [beings] to	0
maturity.	1
These are the respective actions that pertain to the latter [i.e. to the	1
perfections] for, (a) through his generosity, the bodhisattva assists	1
beings. (b) On account of his morality, he does not injure others. (c)	1
Through patience, he endures the injury inflicted by others. (d)	1
Through vigour, he increases his virtues. (e) Through the meditative	1
absorptions, he initiates beings, having attracted them by means of his	1
psychic power etc. (f) Through his wisdom, he liberates them by	1
providing correct counsel. (g) Through the perfection of skill in expe-	1
Tib. inserts 'dod (mată); cf. D20b.5276	0
dients, he causes his generosity etc. to become inexhaustible due to the	0
transformation into universal enlightenment. (h) Through the perfection	1
of vows, he engages in generosity etc. at all times while rejoicing in the	1
birth of a Buddha in all his lives due to his possession of favourable	1
rebirths. (i) Through the perfection of strength, he engages eternally in	1
generosity etc. due to the strength of his critical consideration and	1
meditative development because he is not overcome by adverse ele-	1
ments. (j) Through the perfection of direct intuition, since it removes	1
confusion about the literal meaning of the Dharma, he experiences in	1
return the enjoyment of the Dharma which has generosity etc.	1
controlling influence and he brings beings to maturity.	0

From the highest degree of magnanimity up until the highest degree of	1
accomplishment; these twelve types are considered as highest ¹4. Of	1
these, the highest degree of magnanimity is to be known as not seeking	1
after¹5 all mundane16 success and also as pre-eminence. Success is	1
[equivalent to] prosperity; and this has two aspects: (a) that which is attained and (b)	1
that not attained. Of these, [the bodhisattva] does not become attached to what is	1
attained nor does he strive for what is not attained because he applies himself to the	1
removal of the suffering of others without regard for his own happiness. As has been	1
stated:	1
O virtuous one, what fruit of merit you	1
have; all that is for the benefit of others, not	1
for your own sake¹7.	1
It is [also described as] pre-eminence18 because its fruit is Buddhahood which is	1

endowed with relinquishment, direct intuition and might. Alternatively, the sublime	0
person is generally described as being of two sorts: (a) munificent and (b) devoid of	1
the desire for services in return. Therefore, the bodhisattva does not strive for all mun-	1
dane success ¹9 but applies himself to the perfections, such as generosity, which are	1
ever increasing. This is what is described as the magnanimity of spiritual practice.	1
[2] The highest degree of duration...; its pre-eminence is on account of its	1
duration. Moreover, duration refers to the extended practice of the perfections begin-	1
ning with generosity. And since it is not known as to how long this endures, he says:	1
is due to the cultivation [of the perfections] for three countless aeons.	0
For, the bodhisattvas' meditative development of the perfections, such as generosity, is	1
of exceeding duration because it is completed over three countless aeons.	1
[3] The highest degree of prerogative20 is due to the prerogative for	1
deeds of benefit for all beings21. It is described as the highest by way of pre-	1
rogative22 (adhikārataḥ) since the bodhisattvas engage in generosity etc. without	1
regard for their own happiness for the sake of (adhikṛtya) bringing about welfare and	1
happiness for all beings.	1
[4] The highest degree of inexhaustibility 23...; it is of the highest degree on	1
account of the fact that it is inexhaustible; but what is its inexhaustibility due to? Hence	1
he says: is due to the complete absence of exhaustion on account of the	1
transformation into universal enlightenment24. Even after yielding the karma-	1
result in all places of rebirth (the perfections], such as generosity which consist in the	0
transformation into universal enlightenment, are not completely severed. Even in the	1
nirväņa devoid of the remnants of existence they are not exhausted due to: (a) the pro-	1
duction of the Dharma Body which is characterized by the turning about of the basis	1
and (b) the inexhaustibility of that [Dharma Body]. However, they are severed in the	1
nirvāṇa realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence through the transformation	1
into enlightenment of the śrävaka etc. due to the severance of the basis [i.e. the body 125	1
in every respect.	0
[5] Alternatively, [the perfections] such as generosity become inexhaustible through	1
the transformation into universal enlightenment due to the abundant karma-result; and	1
what is abundant is said to be inexhaustible because it is not completely exhausted	1
through the yielding of the karma-result. But the transformation into enlightenment of	1

the śrävaka etc. is not inexhaustible in this way. Or else, for the bodhisattvas, the roots	1
of the wholesome that are transformed into universal enlightenment for the benefit of	1
beings become inexhaustible, like the realms of beings; hence, like the realms of	0
beings, they are not completely exhausted.	1
[6] The highest degree of continuity is due to a firm conviction in the	1
sameness of self and others due to the fulfilment of the perfections of	1
generosity etc. in regard to all beings26. For, on the Joyous spiritual level, the	1
bodhisattva becomes firmly convinced of the sameness of self and others because of	1
his awareness of the all-pervading meaning 27 of the dharmadhātu. Having relin-	1
quished conceptual differentiation in regard to self and others due to his firm convic-	1
tion in the sameness of self and others he obtains an extremely joyous mind on account	1
of others' generosity etc., just as he does on account of his own generosity etc. As the	1
consequence this the perfections, such as generosity, are continually fulfilled every	1
instant, every moment and every day.	1
[7] The highest degree of non-hardship is due to the fulfillment of the	1
perfection of generosity etc. on the part of others, through his approval	1
alone. The bodhisattvas with joyous mind express their approval of the roots of the	1
wholesome, such as the generosity of beings, in such a way that the perfections, such	1
as generosity, of those [beings] is fulfilled through that approval alone.	1
[8] The highest degree of wealth is due to the fulfillment of generosity	1
etc. on account of the 'treasury of the sky' meditative concentration etc.	1
The bodhisattvas obtain the meditative concentration called 'treasury of the sky' through	1
meditative development which penetrates the dharmadhātu. From obtaining this, they	1
cause the fulfillment of the perfection of generosity because they are then able to fulfill	1
all the aspirations of sentient beings. For, under the influence of this, the very sky	1
(gagana) becomes a treasury (gañja) - thus it is designated as the 'treasury of the sky'	1
(gagana-ganja) meditative concentration. Alternatively, a treasury (gańja) is established	1
in the sky (gagana)28 because all of the necessities of life are produced from the sky	1
"through the power of this meditative concentration29. By the word ""etc."" the meditative"	1
concentrations that are taught in the Sutras of the Prajñāpäramitãs etc. are referred to.	1
[9] The highest degree of possession is due to the possession [by the	1
bodhisattva] of direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differenti-	1
ation. For the bodhisattvas' direct intuition is devoid of conceptual differentiation³0	1

[10] The highest degree of enterprise refers to an abundant measure of	0
patience on the spiritual level of the one who courses in firm convic-	1
tion. The first immeasurable aeon is described as the level of the one who courses in	1
firm conviction. Moreover, through the force of the spiritual lineage and friends, there	0
is, in those whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated, a totally firm convic-	1
tion33 in the insubstantiality of the dharmas in terms of the three natures this consists	1
in an abundant measure of patience which is not overpowered by adverse elements	1
such as lack of faith34. For this is the state of enterprise of the bodhisattva, and as a	1
consequence, his patience in abundant measure is described as the highest degree of	1
enterprise.	1
due to their non-perception of the trio, i.e. the giver³1, the object given and the recipient.	0
Similarly, their direct intuition is devoid of conceptual differentiation due to their non-	1
perception of [the three modes of the other nine perfections³2] up until the knower,	1
object of knowledge and the knowledge itself. The spiritual practice of generosity etc.	0
is encompassed by that highest direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.	1
How so? Because it conforms with that [direct intuition] and because it has the latter	1
as objective support hence is it described as highest.	1
[11] The highest degree of acquisition refers to the first spiritual level.	1
For the supramundane perfections are obtained on the first spiritual level because of	1
[the bodhisattvas] awareness of the all-pervading nature of 'the dharmadhātu. How-	0
since the mundane [perfections] were included previously by way of the prepara-	0
tion for the first spiritual level, it is said that on the first spiritual level there is the high-	1
est degree of acquisition.	1
ever,	0
[12] The highest degree of natural outcome refers to the eight [spiritual	1
levels] subsequent to the latter. Acquisition that is distinctively superior on the	1
eight spiritual levels other than the latter [i.e. the first] is the natural outcome of the per-	1
fections acquired on the first spiritual level³5, thus it is the highest degree of natural	1
outcome. Alternatively, the highest degree of acquisition refers to the acquisition of the	1
first spiritual level through the force of the meditative development of the perfections	1
on the level of the one who courses in firm conviction. A quotation from a Sūtra	1
states:	1
The first spiritual level is included in the path of vision of the bodhisattva	1
and because of his entry into that, [the bodhisattva] is born in the spiritual	1

The remaining spiritual levels are the highest degree of natural outcome because they	1
are the outcome38 of the first level acquired through the force of the meditative devel-	1
opment 39 of the perfections. Or again, the highest degree of natural outcome refers to	1
the eight spiritual levels [other than the first] because they are the natural outcome of	1

lineage of the tathāgata³6 due to his acquisition of the qualities that have its	0
nature and are in conformity with it.37	1
[13] The highest degree of accomplishment refers to the tenth spiritual	1
level and to that of the tathāgata 40 since these are the [respective]	1
accomplishments of (a) the bodhisattvas and (b) the Buddhas.	1
(a) Since	1
the bodhisattva reaches the end of all the bodhisattva courses on the tenth spiritual	1
level, he is consecrated there41 as an incumbent (Buddha] by the tathāgatas. There is	1
the highest degree of accomplishment for the bodhisattvas on the tenth spiritual level42	1
because of: (i) the fulfilment of an inconceivable accumulation of merit and direct	1
intuition; (ii) the absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to all dharmas and (iii)	1
the production of benefit, in every respect, for oneself and others. (b) But on the spiri-	1
tual level of the tathāgatas43, since the Venerable One becomes the teacher of the whole	1
world because he attains pre-eminence in relinquishment, direct intuition and might	1
hence there is accomplishment as the full accomplishment of the Buddhas. But what is	0
this accomplishment? It is the achievement of the qualities of the bodhisattva and of	1
the qualities of the Buddha, in every respect.	1
[14] Alternatively, the culmination of the perfections that are included on the level of	1
one still in training is [equivalent to] the tenth spiritual level; hence, there the full	0
accomplishment of the bodhisattva on that [level]. The highest limit of [the perfec-	1
tions] that are included on the level of the adept is (equivalent to the Buddha level.	1
Since training in the perfections is no longer present on that level, there is full accom-	1
plishment as the full accomplishment of the Buddhas. Thus, the highest degree of full	1
accomplishment is to be known as: (a) the full accomplishment of the bodhisattvas on	1
the tenth spiritual level and (b) the full accomplishment of the Buddha on the level of	1
the tathāgata.	1

Consequently, the ten perfections are	1
considered 44 in the highest sense.	1
Since these 45 twelvefold [spiritual practices] exist in the highest degree	1
within the latter [i.e. in the perfections], such as in the generosity [practised	1
by] the bodhisattva, but not in the generosity etc. of the śrävaka, consequently, the	1
ten perfections beginning with generosity and concluding with direct intuition	1
which pertain just to the bodhisattva are considered in this sense, i.e. as high-	1
est according to the rules of etymology. Thus it is just the spiritual practice that	1
pertains to the ten46 perfections which is said to be of the highest degree.	1

Actions that: (a) are of assistance,	1
(b) are non-violent, (c) endure such	1

For, through generosity, the bodhisattva assists beings. (a) In this regard,	1

who is indifferent to both the service49 in return for a favour and the karma-result	1
abandons objective and subjective entities on account of a particular volition and	0
bestows [gifts on beings] through his acts of body and speech this is the material	1

scriptural treatises, arts and crafts and [the practice of] non-violence towards beings,	0
[instructions] which are preceded by compassion, as well as the instructions on propit-	0

over, by means of these [the bodhisattva] assists beings by removing the sufferings of	0
samsāra due to (wrong) modes of living and wretched states of existence. (c) The gift	1
of fearlessness consists of liberation for those who are attacked by kings 50, thieves,	1
kinsmen or beasts of prey etc. and thereby he assists beings by removing the fear of	1
calamity to life, enjoyment, children and wife etc.	1
[17] He does not injure these [beings]51 on account of his morality.	1
Morality refers to abstention from all misdeeds of body and speech, and, in keeping	1
with worldly practice, abstention (from the acts of body and speech) which are forbid-	1
den and the performance of the acts of body and speech that are prescribed. Because	1
he is established in this morality [the bodhisattva), even for the sake of his life, does	1
not injure or offend beings himself, nor does he cause others to do so.	1
[18] Through patience, he endures the injury inflicted 52 by others.	1
Patience consists in the endurance and toleration of all forms of suffering with a mind	1
predominated by compassion. On account of this (the bodhisattva] endures injury	1
such as murder53, bondage or the beatings inflicted by others, because he has no wish	1
to retaliate54.	1
[19] Through vigour, he increases his virtues. Vigour is a strength of will	1
with reference to generosity etc.; increase is the accomplishment of superior virtues due	1
to the practice of the virtues of generosity etc. on account of that [vigour].	1
[20] Through the meditative absorptions, he initiates [beings], having	1
"attracted them by means of his psychic power etc. By the word ""etc."", the"	1
knowledge of the mental make-up of others 55 is included. Meditative absorption refers	1
to meditative concentration, i.e. the single-pointedness of mind. Psychic power is [the	1
power of] flying through the air etc. Initiation refers to the exposition of the real nature	1
of the teachings because those who are attracted by psychic power and the extra-	1
ordinary ability to read the thoughts [of others], which result from the meditative	1
absorptions, have the capacity to be initiated in the teachings.	1
[21] Through his wisdom, he liberates [beings] by providing correct	1
counsel56. Wisdom is characterized by the investigation of the dharmas in all	1
aspects; moreover, the action pertinent to this is the provision of correct counsel and	1
the relinquishment of moral defilement, [both of which are dependent upon instruc-	1

tions that are free from erroneous inversion. Hence, [the bodhisattval liberates	0
[beings] through his wisdom by providing correct counsel.	1
[22] Through the perfection of skill in expedients, he causes his gen-	1
erosity etc. to become inexhaustible due to the transformation into	1
universal enlightenment. An expedient is a particular device for the accomplish-	1
ment, the augmentation, the attainment or the relinquishment of a dharma; therefore, the	1
skill or proficiency in regard to that is [described as] the skill in expedients. The action	1
pertinent to this causes the generosity etc. that has been performed and accumulated 57	1
to become inexhaustible through the transformation into universal enlightenment. The	0
roots of the wholesome which consist in the transformation into universal enlighten-	1
ment, like universal enlightenment itself, become inexhaustible.	1
[23] Through the perfection of vows he engages in generosity etc. at all	1
times while rejoicing in the birth of a Buddha58 in all of his rebirths due	1
to his possession of favourable births. Because vows have the nature of all	1
sorts of wishes 59, a vow in this context is considered as being the wish for a rebirth in	1
keeping with one's wholesome [deeds]. The action pertinent to this is the engagement	1
in generosity etc. at all times while rejoicing in the birth of a Buddha in each of one's	1
rebirths.	1
[24] Through the perfection of strength, he engages eternally in gen-	1
erosity etc. due to the strength 60 of his critical consideration and medi-	1
tative development, because he is not overcome by adverse elements.	1
Critical consideration refers to wisdom; meditative development refers to the practice in	1
[developing] the wholesome dharmas. Both of these, which cannot be overcome by	1
adverse elements, are described as the perfection of strength. The action pertinent to	1
this is the engagement in generosity etc. of necessity every moment, for the word	1
'eternal' is synonymous with 'perpetual'. Thus the wholesome [deeds] such as	1
generosity which possesses the strength of critical consideration and meditative devel-	0
opment are not overcome by the adverse ones61.	1
[25] Through the perfection of direct intuition, since it removes confu-	1
sion about the literal meaning of the Dharma, he experiences in return	1
the enjoyment of the Dharma which has generosity etc. as its control-	1

ling influence, and he brings beings to maturity. The perfection of direct	0
intuition is the direct intuition that is devoid of confusion concerning the literal meaning	1
of all the doctrinal teachings of the universal vehicle. What is this confusion in regard	1
to the literal meaning? This confusion in regard to literal meaning refers to that	1
whereby one construes [the meaning] in just the literal sense after rejecting the intended	1
meaning. The Dharma, i.e. the Sütras etc., which is taught with reference to generos-	1
ity, i.e. having made generosity the objective support, has generosity as its controlling	1
influence,. [The Dharma] should be considered in the same way [in regard to the	1
other perfections] i.e. as having morality, patience and vigour etc. as controlling influ-	1
ence. The actions pertinent to the perfection of direct intuition are: (a) the experiencing	1
of the enjoyment of the Dharma and (b) the maturation of beings, through: (a) analyti-	1
cal discussion [of the Dharma]62 which is free from erroneous inversion concerning	1
the universal vehicle on the part of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas63 and (b) the bring-	1

erroneous inversion because the Dharma instructions, such as the Sutras, are consti-	1

b. Spiritual Practice in relation to Mental	1
Attention.	1
In the universal vehicle, the continuous mental attention to the	1
Dharmas, such as the Sutras, as set out with reference to generosity etc.	1
is the spiritual practice in regard to mental attention through the wisdom	0

śrävaka vehicle? For two reasons:	1
V.10 c	0
Because of their: (a) superiority and	1
(b) inexhaustibility.	1
How can it be due to their: (a) superiority and (b) inexhaustibility?	1
V.10 d	1
Because they: (a) assist others and	1
(b) do not cease.286	1
They are superior because they are engaged in assisting others.	1
They are to be known as inexhaustible because they are not appeased,	1
i.e. do not cease, even in parinirvāpa.	1
Spiritual practice in relation to mental attention has now been	1
described.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y209.12 [1] The spiritual practice in relation to mental attention should be mentioned immedi-	1
ately following the explanation of the highest spiritual practice; consequently, he asks:	1
which is the spiritual practice in relation to mental attention? Hence he	1
says:	1
V.7 ab	0
[The bodhisattva's] mental attention,	1
in the universal vehicle, to the	0
Dharmas 65 as set out etc.	0
The mental attention to the Dharmas such as the Sütras as set out66 with	1
reference to generosity etc., i.e. with reference to67 generosity, morality, patience,	1
vigour etc. Herein, (the mental attention to] the Dharmas, such as the Sūtras, mixtures	1
of prose and verse and also the prophesies taught by the Venerable One with reference	1
to generosity in whatever mode, which are so devoid of superimposition and negation	1
as to meaning and word, is the spiritual practice in regard to mental attention;	1
not anything else. In the universal vehicle, but not in the śrävaka vehicle; for, in	0
the latter, generosity etc. 68 is taught as being just for one's own benefit and not for the	1
benefit of oneself as well as others, as in the universal vehicle. Therefore, it is just in	1
the universal vehicle that the mental attention by the bodhisattvas to the Dharmas, such	1
as the Sūtras as set out with reference to generosity etc., is the spiritual practice in	1
regard to mental attention. It is made known that in the śrävaka vehicle the mental	1
attention to the Sutras etc. that are preached with reference to generosity etc. is a false	1
spiritual practice in regard to mental attention69 because it has just the benefit of the	1
individual for its basis. Moreover, for the most part, these [Dharmas of the universal	1
vehicle] are taught with reference to evenmindedness, non-attachment, lack of arro-	1
gance and non-perception. Evenmindedness, in this respect, is the wish to assist	1
equally both those who possess virtues and those who do not. Non-attachment, in this	1
respect, is the application in regard to generosity etc. that is only for the benefit of	1
others on the part of one who has no wish for existence and enjoyment. Lack arto-	1

manasikāra is not substantiated by the Tib.; cf. D293a.7.Y211	1
gance, in this respect, is to not praise oneself nor despise others on account of one's	0
generosity etc. Non-perception, in this respect, is the purification of the three aspects	1
[of giving] according to the rule of the non-perception of the gift, the giver and the	1
recipient. Continuously, i.e. again and again, through the wisdom that	1
consists in: (a) learning, (b) reflection and (c) meditative development.	1
Of these, (a) that which consists in learning is the certainty that comes from the authori-	1
tative statements of a trustworthy person. (b) That which consists in reflection is [the	1
certainty] that comes from reasoning and profound reflection. (c) That which consists	1
in meditative development is [the certainty] that comes from meditative development.	1
[2] Since all engagement is for the sake of the result, he asks: through these three	1
modes of wisdom what virtue does that 70 mental attention bring71? Hence	1
he says:	1
V.8 ab	0
(c) success in one's aim;	0
The constituent element is the spiritual lineage72, i.e. the 'seed'; its nourishment is	0
[equivalent to] its augmentation. And, on account of the nourishment of the constituent	1
element, one becomes possessed of brilliant and extensive wisdom in the future. [The	1
bodhisattva] whole-heartedly enters into the meaning of what he has	1
learnt. Through the wisdom that consists in reflection, he resolutely enters into the	1
true meaning 73 that is not erroneously inverted 74 because this is generated through the	1
force of reasoning in respect of the meaning of those Dharmas such as the Sūtras that	1
he has learnt. Through [the wisdom] that consists in meditative develop-	1
ment, he attains success in his aims. The success in one's aims is [equivalent	1
to] the understanding of reality. How so? He says: because [such wisdom]	1
causes the purification for entry to the spiritual levels. For, he enters the	1
spiritual levels through the purifying [processes] of the applications of mindfulness etc.	1
Hence it is explained that he enters the spiritual levels only through the applications of	1
mindfulness etc. Consequently, he attains success in his aims due to the purifying	1
[processes] that come from the wisdom that consists in the meditative development of	1
the applications of mindfulness etc. which constitute the entry to the spiritual levels.	0
What is meant is: he enters the spiritual levels.	1
It leads to: (a) the nourishment of	1
the constituent element, (b) entry and	1

[3] Furthermore, this spiritual practice in relation to mental attention is to be known as	1
being in accompaniment with its accessory elements; it is not in isolation. What are its	1
accessory elements 75? He says:	1
V.8 cd	0
This is to be known as being encompassed by...; what is meant is:	1
'surrounded by'. The acts of the Dharma are the acts which have the Dharma as their	1
nature, or else, which have the Dharma as their authority. But since they are not	1
known, he asks 77: which are the tenfold acts of the Dharma787 Hence he	1
says:	1
V.9 a	0
They are: (a) transcription, (b) ven-	1
eration, (c) giving79 etc.	1
Of these, there is: the transcription by oneself or someone else [of the works]	1
of the universal vehicle either to preserve them for a long time or in order to listen	0
to them. Its veneration with flowers, incense, lamps80 and perfumes etc. it is the	1
universal vehicle that is referred to. Having paid respect to it, the giving of the	1
written works etc. to others81 by one who has entered the universal vehicle. Having	1
paid respect to it, listening when it is being recited by another. Reading it	1
oneself with great reverence. Receiving it, i.e. appropriating it oneself with great	0
faith. Revealing 82, i.e. making known, through great effort, the texts or their	1
meaning to those who are worthy. Recitation, i.e. the repeated practice of what has	1
been received. Reflection, i.e. determining the meaning by way of reasoning.	1
Meditative development, i.e. practice by way of wisdom that has been concen-	1
"trated. The word ""and"" has the conjunctive sense. Of these, the actions of the body"	1
are demonstrated through the four terms: transcription, veneration, giving and listening.	1
The actions of speech are demonstrated through the four terms83: reading, receiving84,	1
revealing and reciting. And the actions of mind are demonstrated through the pair:	1
reflection and meditative development.	0
This [spiritual practice] is to be	1

ten acts of the Dharma76	1

V.10 ab	1
For, these tenfold acts entail an im-	1
measurable collection of merit85;	1
The collection of merit that arises from each particular Dharmic act, i.e. from the	0
Dharmic acts that are said to be of ten types, cannot be measured either by oneself or	1
by another because it is far too great. Why is it, when [both vehicles] are equal as	1
regards explanations of the Dharma in regard to generosity, morality, the meditative	0
absorptions etc., that in the Sütras, the acts of the Dharma are taught as	1
having an exorbitantly great result only in the universal vehicle, but in	1
the Sutras, the acts of the Dharma are not taught in the śrävaka vehicle as having	1
a great result? For two reasons are the acts of the Dharma taught as having an	1
exorbitantly great result in the universal vehicle as to which are these two86, he says:	1
V.10 c	0
Because of their: (a) superiority and	1
(b) inexhaustibility;	1
Since these two are not known, he asks: how can it be due to their: (a) superi-	0
ority and (b) inexhaustibility? Hence he says:	1
V.10 d	0
Because they: (a) assist others and	1
(b) do not cease.	1
For, in the universal vehicle, the spiritual practice of the bodhisattva in regard to gen-	1
erosity etc. is taught as being uniformly instrumental in providing benefit for all	1
beings87, but its chief object in the śrävaka vehicle is the benefit for oneself. Hence, the	1
universal vehicle is superior88 to the śrävaka vehicle because it is engaged in	1
assisting others. Thus, when one states the motive [for its practice], the universal	1
vehicle is superior in comparison with the śrävaka vehicle. Its inexhaustibility is	1
due to the manifestation of an inconceivable result of the accumulation of merit and	1
penetrating insight which: (a) is incorporated in the three [Buddha] Bodies, (b) is	0
engaged in deeds of welfare for beings for as long as the world exists, (c) is not	0
appeased even in the nirvāṇa realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence and (d)	1
is characterized by the turning about of the basis. However, this is not so in the case of	0
the śrävaka vehicle, for the result of the accumulations of the śrävaka is said to be	1
exhaustible because it is severed completely on the part of those who have attained the	1
nirvāṇa devoid of the remnants of existence. Thus, in respect of nirvana too, the	1
universal vehicle is superior to the śrävaka vehicle because of the manifestation of a	1
result that does not cease89.	1

[5] Alternatively, the aim of the universal vehicle which consists in generosity etc. is	1
devoted to the assistance of all beings; however, the aim of the śrävaka vehicle is not	1
the same since it is intent upon benefit for oneself. Moreover, the bodhisattvas'	1
dharmas, such as generosity, which are brought about owing to the purity of their	0
bodies, are not interrupted even in parinirvāṇa. However, because of the analogy of	1
the path of the śrāvaka as a raft⁹0, [the dharmas] are completely eradicated in	1
parinirvăņa, thus they are not inexhaustible. Therefore, it is appropriate that the	0
Dharmic acts provide a great result only in the universal vehicle and not in the śrāvaka	1
vehicle.	1
c. Spiritual Practice that Conforms with the	1
Dharma	1
Which is the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma?	1
V.11 ab	1
Spiritual practice that conforms with	0
the Dharma is that which becomes	1
free from: (i) distraction and (ii)	1
erroneous inversion;	1
These are	0
the twofold spiritual practices that conform with the	1
Dharma, namely, (i) that which becomes free from distraction and (ii)	1
that which becomes free from erroneous inversion.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
213.22 [1] The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma should be mentioned imme-	1
diately after the spiritual practice in relation to mental attention, consequently, he asks:	1
which is the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma? Hence it	1
is said:	1
V.11 ab	0
Spiritual practice that conforms with	0
the Dharma is that which becomes	1
free from: (i) distraction and (ii)	1
erroneous inversion;9	1
The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma refers to the spiritual practice that	1
is adapted to the Dharma, that is to be meditated upon and known, which consists in	1

the meditative development of tranquillization and penetrating insight 92 that have been	0
entered into. Of these, that which becomes free from distraction consists in	1
the meditative development of tranquillization and that which becomes free from	1
erroneous inversion consists in the meditative development of penetrating insight.	1
These are the twofold spiritual practices that conform with the Dharma.	1
That which becomes Free from Distraction.	1
The freedom from distraction in this regard is due to the absence of	1
six types of distraction. These six types of distraction are: (a) innate	1
distraction, (b) external distraction, (c) internal distraction, (d) the dis-	1
traction of signs, (e) distraction consisting in disquiet and (f) distrac-	1
tion to mental attention. How should the characteristic of each of these	1
be understood? He says:	1
V.11 cd & 12 abcd	0
(a) Emergence, (b) dispersal towards	1
sense objects, (c) relishment, indo-	1
lence and excitability 93, (d) the ten-	1
dency to [self] esteem, (e) 'I-notion'	1
with mental attention and (f) an infer-	0
ior mentality these are the distrac-	1
tions to be clearly comprehended by	1
one who possesses intelligence.	1
Thus are the characteristics of the six types of distraction that	1
should be clearly comprehended by the bodhisattva. Of these, (a)	1
innate distraction refers to one's emergence from meditative develop-	0
ment through the groups of the five consciousnesses. (b) External	1
distraction refers to the dispersal towards a sense-object. (c) Internal	1
distraction refers to the relishing of meditative concentration and indo-	1
lence and excitability. (d) The distraction of the 'sign' refers to the	1
intention for [self] esteem, having created this 'sign' through applica-	1
tion. (e) Distraction that consists in disquiet refers to the mental atten-	1
tiveness accompanied by 'I-notion' because pride manifests through the	1
force of disquiet. (f) Distraction to mental attention refers to the	1
inferior mentality because of the manifestation of the mental attention of	1
the inferior vehicle.	1

Read: -ddhavaḥ as per Ms. (cf. N's fn.9 p.64); cf. also my fn.59 p.231 (Ch. IV.4).[Sthiramati]	1
214.7 [1] Since this prefix 'a' occurs in many senses, it is not known as to which of these [is	1
"applicable] in the term ""freedom from distraction"" (a-vikṣepa), hence he says: the"	1
freedom from distraction in this regard is due to the absence of six	1
types of distraction. And since it is not known as to how distraction can be six-	1
fold, he says: these six types of distraction are: (a) innate distraction, (b)	1
external distraction etc. 94 etc. Although this is so, distraction has only been	1
shown by way of its differentiation but not by way of its essential nature, thus he asks:	1
how should the characteristic of each of these six types of distraction be	1
understood?⁹5 Hence he says:	1
V.11 c	0
nesses.	0
"The expression: ""by one who possesses intelligence"" [means] the intelligent one, i.e."	1
the bodhisattva. Of these, one's emergence from meditative concentration	1
through the groups of the five consciousnesses...; for, when one of any of	0
the five consciousnesses, such as sight, arise in one who is meditatively concentrated,	1
he has then emerged from meditative concentration this is innate distraction	1
because it is occupied with externals. The emergence from meditative concentration	1
through the groups of the five consciousnesses is described as innate distraction	1
because it consists in the distraction that pertains to the groups of the five conscious-	1
(a) Emergence, (b) dispersal towards	0
a sense-object etc.	1
[2] External distraction refers to the dispersal⁹6 towards a sense-object.	1
Some believe that when the mind-consciousness of one who is meditatively concen-	1
trated moves unintentionally away from the meditative objective to another objective	1
support it is external distraction because [consciousness] transfers to the other objec-	0
tive support. Others believe that when one who is meditatively concentrated relin-	1
quishes the meditative objective, the transference to another sense-object by mind-	1
consciousness is external distraction.	1
[3] Internal distraction refers to the relishing of meditative concentra-	1
tion, and indolence and excitability. If one who is concentrated relishes a	1
particular meditative concentration on account of moral defilement, such as craving, he	1
becomes distracted from that pure meditative concentration due to the proximity of	1
defiled concentration. Also, he is distracted from that meditative concentration wherein	1
tranquillization and penetrating insight are brought together on account of indolence	1

and excitability 97. Since relishment, indolence and excitability are impairments for one	0
who is concentrated 98, relishing etc. are described as internal distractions.	1
[4] The distraction of the 'sign' refers to the intention for [self] esteem.	1
A meditator may consider himself a great being and thus holds himself in esteem; on	1
account of this 'sign' on the part of one who has applied himself to meditative concen-	1
tration there is distraction from the wholesome side, whether it has been obtained or	1
not, due to the waning away of his [original] aspiration this is described as the	1
distraction of the 'sign'. Here now he provides the reason: having created this	1
'sign' through application. Having created the 'sign', i.e. that intention for [self]	1
esteem on account of the desire for a reputation for skill99, thinking that [thereby],	1
because he has applied himself to meditative concentration, there would be esteem for	1
himself.	1
[5] The distraction that consists in disquiet refers to mental attentive-	1
ness accompanied by 'I-notion'. Even while resolutely seeking the virtues of	1
meditative concentration one who possesses mental attention, accompanied by I-	1
notion 100, is associated with pride insofar as he may consider himself to be a meditator	1
- and as a consequence of this he exalts himself and holds others in contempt. Why	1
does this mental attention consist in disquiet? Hence he says: because pride mani-	1
fests through the force of disquiet. This is what is being said: distraction that	1
is characterized by disquiet is [described as] the distraction that consists in disquiet¹01.	1
But what is disquiet? It is the full maturation of the latent impressions of pride since	1
"pride manifest on account of it; thus [it is said]: ""because pride manifests through the"	0
"force of that [i.e. disquiet]"". Others believe that disquiet refers to the false view of"	1
individuality.	1
[6] Distraction to mental attention refers to the inferior mentality.	1
account of: (a) the fear of the sufferings of samsāra, (b) acting wrongly towards sen-	0
tient beings and (c) being in company with people who are not good spiritual friends,	1
the śrāvaka pratyekabuddha mentality arises in one who has applied himself to the	0
mental attention of the universal vehicle but whose spiritual lineage as a śråvaka etc. is	1
not determined. This is the inferior mentality because it has merely the benefit for one-	1

self as its main object. This śrävaka and pratyekabuddha mentality is described 102 as a	0
distraction to mental attention since it is a distraction to the mental attention of the	1
universal vehicle. Here now he provides the reason: because of the manifestation	1
of the mental attention of the inferior vehicle103. The inferior vehicle refers	1
to the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles. The manifestation of this mental attention	1
distracts one from the mental attention of the universal vehicle because it is essentially	1
occupied with [attainment of] parinirvāṇa for oneself - thus it is said that the distraction	1
to mental attention refers to inferior mentality. Thus this absence of the faults of the six	1
types of distraction on the part of the bodhisattva is to be known as the meditative	1
development of tranquillization 104.	1
That which Becomes Free from Erroneous Inversion.	1
Therein, the absence of erroneous inversion is to be known in rela-	1
tion to ten kinds of entities, namely:	1
V.13 abcd	0
In regard to these:	1
V.14 abcd	0
(a) Syllables, (b) object, (c) mental	1
activity, (d) non-dispersal, (e) & (f)	1
the dual characteristics, (g) lack of	0
purity and purity, (h) what is adven-	1

The object both exists and does not	1
exist (a) because of combination and	1
familiarity and (b) because of sepa-	1
ration and lack of familiarity this is	1
the absence of erroneous inversion	1
in relation to syllables.	1
When there is a combination of syllables as an uninterrupted articu-	1
lation, they have significance due to familiarity inasmuch as one thinks:	1
"""this is the name of that"". In the contrary case, they are devoid of"	1
significance. Seeing that this is so is to be known as the absence of	1

It appears as the duality, i.e. as apprehended object and apprehend-	1
ing subject, since it arises in the aspect of these [two] although it does	1
not exist as such, i.e. in the way in which it appears. Seeing this in	1
regard to the object is [equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inver-	1
sion in relation to it. The object is devoid of existence because of the	1
non-existence of both apprehended object and apprehending subject; it	1
is devoid of non-existence because of the real existence of its erroneous	1
appearance as that [duality].	1
V.16 abcd	1
Mental activity that consists in talk	1
is developed by that [dualistic] talk	1
and is the basis for it this is the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in	1
relation to mental activity which is	1
the ground for the manifestation of	1
the duality.	1
Mental activity that consists in talk is fully developed by talk that	1
pertains to the apprehended object and apprehending subject and is the	1
basis for that conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject. Thus, this is [equivalent to the absence of erro-	1
neous inversion in relation to mental activity. In relation to which	1
mental activity? In relation to that which forms the ground for the	1
manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject. For,	1
this mental activity that consists in talk is to be known as the basis for	1
the conceptual differentiation of apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject because it is fully developed by verbal notions.	1

That which was just described as the existence or non-existence of	1
the object is considered like a magical creation etc. In the same way	1
that a magical creation neither exists as an entity such as an elephant,	1
nor is it non-existent because it exists as 'bare' error; so too does the	1
object neither exist in the way in which it manifests, i.e. as the appre-	1
hended object and apprehending subject, nor is it non-existent because	1
"it exists as 'bare' error. By the word ""etc."", similes such as mirages,"	1
dreams and the reflection of the moon on water are to be understood as	1
is appropriate. That which sees the non-dispersal of mind in this way,	0
since it sees in the object its resemblance to a magical creation etc., is	1
[equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-	0
dispersal because the non-dispersal of mind towards existent or non-	1
existent entities is on account of it.	1
The fact that everything is name-only	1
is for the non-engagement in all con-	0
ceptual differentiation this is the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in	1
relation to the individual charac-	1
teristic;	1
V.18 d	0
All this is name-only, i.e. that which comprises [the sense-fields of]	1
sight/form up until mind/non-sensibles knowing that this is so [acts]	0
as the counteragent to all conceptual differentiation. This is [equivalent	1
to] the absence of conceptual differentiation in relation to the individual	1
characteristic. In relation to which individual characteristic?	1
In relation to the individual charac-	1
teristic in an ultimate sense.	1
However, the notion that this is name-only in a conventional sense,	1
is not accepted.	1
V.19 abcd	1
Since no dharma is to be found out-	1
side the dharmadhatu, therefore the	1
latter is the universal characteristic	1
this is the absence of erroneous in-	1
version in relation to that.	1
Since no dharma whatsoever is to be found that is exempt from the	1
insubstantiality of the dharmas, therefore, the dharmadhātu is the uni-№68	1
versal characteristic of all the dharmas knowing that this is so is	1
[equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1
universal characteristic.	1
V.20 abcd	1
The lack of purity on the part of that	1
[i.e. the dharmadhatu] and its purity	1
are due to the non-relinquishment	0
and relinquishment of erroneously	1
inverted mental activity this is the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in	1
relation to that.	1
A lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the non-	1
relinquishment of erroneously inverted mental activity; purity [on its	1
behalf] refers to the relinquishment of that knowing that this is so is	1
[equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack	1
of purity and purity, respectively.	1
V.21 abcd	1
This pair is adventitious, for, the	1
dharmadhātu is pure by nature, like	0
space, this is the absence of erro-	0
neous inversion in relation to that.	1
Moreover, because the dharmadhātu is pure by nature, like space,	1
the pair, i.e. its lack of purity and subsequent purity, is adventitious;	1
knowing that this is so is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous	1
inversion in relation to its adventitious nature.	1
V.22 abcd	1
Defilement and purity do not belong	1
to the dharmas nor to the personal	1
entity because they do not exist,	1
hence, there is neither fear nor	1
arrogance this is the absence of	1
erroneous inversion in relation to	1
that.	1
There is no defilement nor purity on the part of the personal entity	1
nor the dharmas because neither the personal entity exists nor do the	1
dharmas. Consequently, there is no defilement nor purification of any-	1
one whatsoever. Hence, concerning the side of defilement, there is no	1
deficiency on the part of anyone and concerning the side of purification,	1
there is no excellence on the part of anyone on account of which fear	1
and arrogance [respectively] would result. This is [equivalent to] the216.15	1
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of	1
arrogance.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Thus, the manner in which the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma	1
and which becomes free from erroneous inversion is to be cultivated by one who is	0
devoid of distraction is now described. That which becomes free from erroneous	1
inversion is that which arises in the nature of the absence of erroneous inversion. The	1
absence of erroneous inversion in this regard refers to the knowledge of an entity	1
exactly as it is. Now, in how many types of entity does such an entity consist? Since	1
this is not known, he says: therein, the absence of erroneous inversion is to	1
be known in relation to ten types of entity; in order to demonstrate those	1
entities that are free from erroneous inversion, he says: namely:	1
V.13 ab	0
(a) Syllables, (b) object, (c) mental	1
activity, (d) non-dispersal, (e) the	1
dual characteristics etc.	1
Now, in order to demonstrate the way in which the absence of erroneous inversion	1
relates to these entities, he says: in regard to these:	1
V.14 abcd	0
The object both exists and does not	1
exist, (a) because of combination and	1
familiarity 105 and (b) because of sepa-	1
ration and lack of familiarity 106 this	1
is the absence of erroneous inversion	1
in relation to syllables.	1
"When there is a combination of syllables...; ""combination"" refers to the close"	1
contact of one with another and this is not found on the part of [spoken] syllables	1
because they cannot co-exist since the simultaneous articulation of syllables is not logi-	1
cally tenable. order to dispel the uncertainty that a preceding articulation 107 does not	1
remain 108	1
at the time that subsequent syllables are articulated because they pass away	0
immediately after they are articulated, he says: as an uninterrupted articulation.	1
This is what is being said: an articulation that is not erroneously inverted or sluggish is	1
considered in this regard as a combination of syllables, but the close contact of sylla-	1
bles, one with another, is not. Due to familiarity 109, inasmuch as one thinks:	1
"""this is the name of that""; i.e. when conventional symbols are learnt by heart, one"	1
"thinks: ""this is the name of that entity"", thus, through these two modes [i.e. combina-"	1

tion and familiarity] they have significance. what is meant is: the syllabies are	0
understood. In the contrary case, they are devoid of significancel10; the	1
contrary case refers to the absence of both, or the lack of one of the two. Seeing that	1
this is so, i.e. the knowledge [that this is so], is to be known as the absence of	1
erroneous inversion in relation to syllables in a conventional sense but not in	1
an ultimate sense because the absence of erroneous inversion in an ultimate sense is	1
devoid of conceptual differentiation111. Thus, through this absence of erroneous inver-	1
sion, the bodhisattva penetrates all dharmas free from the meaning of words [i.e. he	1
understands without concepts (vikalpa) expressed in words (sabda)].	1
[2] Now in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in rela-	1
tion to the object which is the cause for its designation by means of syllables, he	1
says:	1
V.15 ab	0
It appears as the duality but is non-	1
existent as such etc.	1
It appears as the duality, i.e. as apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject. What does? The other-dependent nature. Why? Because it possesses the	0
'seed' of the apprehended object and apprehending subject. But what is the meaning of	1
"""appears"" in this context? Hence he says: since it arises in the aspect of these"	0
[two]; i.e. it appears as the apprehended object and apprehending subject because it	1
arises in the aspect of apprehended object and apprehending subject; but this is not due	1
"to the influence of an adjunct, like a crystal. ""But is non-existent as such"", although"	1
it does not exist as such, i.e. in the way, or in the aspect, in which it	1
appears¹12 because it is non-dual by nature. Seeing this in regard to the	1
object, as it is the cause for the arising of the erroneous consciousness, is	1
[equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to it. The	1
intended meaning is that it avoids [the extremes of] existence and non-existence. The	1
object is devoid of existence; here now he provides the reason: because of the	1
non-existence of both apprehended object and apprehending subject 13,	1
The existence of the object [implies] the real existence of apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject; [the object] is devoid of that because it is empty of the aspect of	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject. It is devoid of non-existence...;	1
what is the reason? Because of the real existence of the erroneous appear-	1
ance as that [duality]. What is meant is: because of the real existence of the erro-	1
neous appearance as apprehended object and apprehending subject. And this is said to	1
be an absence of erroneous inversion in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate	1

sense because it is accompanied by conceptual differentiation. Through this know-	0
ledge free from erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva penetrates all dharmas as being	1
devoid of the essential nature of apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
[3] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1
store-consciousness which is the cause for the manifestation¹14 of the apprehended	1
object and apprehending subject¹15, he says:	1
V.16 ab	0
Mental activity that consists in talk	1
is developed by that [dualistic] talk	1
and is the basis for it etc.	1
Mental activity that consists in talk is fully developed by talk that	1
pertains to the apprehended object and apprehending subject 16. With	1
regard to the object that has the characteristic of the manifestation of the apprehended	1
"object and apprehending subject, one has the thought: ""that is the object and this is the"	1
"subject"" such a spoken or mental utterance is described as ""talk"". What is fully"	1
"developed by this talk is described as ""developed"" since it causes the maturation of the"	1
'seed' for the production of talk of the same genre in the future. It is called the mental	1
activity that consists in talk because it is fully developed by talk, for the cause is figu-	1
ratively expressed in the sense of the effect [which it produces]. However, in this	1
context, talk refers to the latent impressions of talk since talk exists in those	1
[impressions] considering that there is no differentiation between the support and that	1
to be supported [i.e. talk and mental activity]. Alternatively, because there is no	1
"mention of the word ""support"" [i.e. one is not the support of the other], one speaks of"	1
mental activity that consists in talk since it is the support for the 'seed' of the con-	1
ceptual differentiation117 of apprehended object and apprehending	1
"subject which is called ""talk""118. Furthermore, it is the basis for talk that arises in"	0
dependence upon the latter, thus, this is [equivalent to] the absence of erro-	1
neous inversion in relation to mental activity. What is meant is: the know-	1
ledge that is not erroneously inverted. But this mental activity, in relation to which	1
there is an absence of erroneous inversion, is not known, hence he asks: in relation	1
to which 19 mental activity is there an absence of erroneous inversion? Hence, in	1
order to specify that mental activity, he says: in relation to that which forms the	1
ground for the manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehend-	1
ing subject. What is meant is: it consists in a special aspect of the store-conscious-	1
ness. In order to demonstrate the way in which the latter forms the ground for the	1

manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, he says: for, this	0
the mental activity that consists in talk... because it is fully developed	0
by verbal notions. It is the fact that it [i.e. the store-consciousness] forms the	1
ground for the manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject that	1
is referred to. Alternatively, as to mental activity that consists in talk, in order to	1
"demonstrate that this causes one's engagement in verbal notions, he has said ¹20: ""it is"	1
described as mental activity that consists in talk because it is fully developed by verbal	1
"notions"". Verbal notions refer to notions that arise from speech, or which cause the"	1
arising of speech. It is on account of these [notions] together with their associated	1
"elements, that the mental activity consisting in talk is described as ""fully developed"","	1
because they cause the maturation of the individual 'seeds' in the mental activity that	1
consists in talk. This too is an absence of erroneous inversion just in a conventional	1
sense but not in an ultimate sense. Moreover, through this absence of erroneous inver-	1
sion, the bodhisattva avoids the underlying cause of erroneous inversion which is	1
characterized by notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending	1
subject and in this way disquiet is easily avoided ¹21.	0
[4] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to	1
non-dispersal, he says:	1
V.17 ab	0
That which was just described as the existence or non-existence of the	1
object... How was it just described? [As the following]:	1
It appears as the duality but is non-existent	1
as such this is the absence of erroneous	0
inversion in relation to the object¹22 and is de-	1
void of existence and non-existence. [V.15]	1
The existence and non-existence of	1
the object is considered like a magi-	1
cal creation etc.	1
"It is considered like a magical creation etc. ""Like a magical creation etc."""	1
[means]: like entities that are magical creations etc. In order to demonstrate just this, he	1
says: in the same way that a magical creation neither exists as an entity	1
such as an elephant, since it manifests in the nature of an elephant etc. which is	1
non-existent in itself123. Although it is said that it does not exist as an entity such as an	1
elephant, it is not non-existent in every respect on the contrary 124: nor is it non-	1

existent because it exists as 'bare' error¹25, It is not non-existent in every	0
respect because of the existence of that 'bare' error that manifests in the aspect of an	1
elephant etc. So too does the object neither exist in the way in which it	1
manifests, i.e. as apprehended object and apprehending subject, nor is it	1
non-existent because of the existence of that 'bare' error which manifests as	1
such in the essential nature126 of the mind and the mental concomitants that pertain to	1
"the three realms of existence ¹27. By the word ""etc."", similes such as mirages,"	1
dreams and the reflection of the moon on water etc. are to be under-	1
stood, as is appropriate. For the mirages, dreams and reflections of the moon on	1
water etc. 128 neither exist in the way in which they appear in the nature of water, men	0
and women¹29, nor indeed do they not exist ¹30 because of the existence of 'bare' error.	1
"In detail, [the statement]: ""so too does the object..."" is to be connected with each"	1
"[simile]. Moreover, by the word ""etc."" in this context131, cities of Gandharvas and"	1
echoes etc. are to be understood. That which sees in this way, without distrac-	1
tion, the non-dispersal of mind towards the sides of existence and non-existence,	1
because it sees in the object its resemblance 132 to a magical creation	1
etc. 133, is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversión in relation	1
to non-dispersal. But what is non-dispersal? Some believe that it consists in the	1
meditative concentration of the middle way134. If this is so, how can there be an	1
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dispersal? Hence he says: because	1
the non-dispersal of mind¹35 toward existent or non-existent entities is	1
on account of it. Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva is	1

not distracted from the objective support for [the realization of] emptiness because of	0
the absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to existence and non-existence136.	1
Therefore, it is described as the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dis-	1
persal 137. And this is an absence of erroneous inversion in just a conventional sense,	1
but not in an ultimate sense, for the latter is devoid of conceptual differentiation.	1
[5] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1
individual characteristic, he says:	1
V.18 ab	0
The fact that everything is name-only	1
is for the non-engagement in all con-	0
ceptual differentiation 138 etc.	1
All this is name-only, i.e. that which¹39 comprises [the sense-fields of]	1
sight/form up until mind/non-sensibles hence all that comprises the twelve	1
sense-fields is to be known as name-only. The designation, in this respect, comprises	1
the own-being and the particulars of the name; also, the own-being of either the object	1
to be designated or the designation does not exist because: (a) it is imaginatively con-	1
structed in such a nature and (b) what is imaginatively constructed does not exist.	1
Otherwise, apprehending would take place through sight etc. 140 regardless of the name,	1
yet there can be no apprehending141 of a conventional symbol that is not known.	1
Therefore, because that object implied by the terms sight/form etc. does not have the	1
own-being of that [sight/form], [the sense-fields of sight/form up until mind/non-	1
sensibles are indeed name-only, [hence] knowing that this is so [acts] as the	1
counteragent to all conceptual differentiation 142. This is [equivalent to]	1
the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual charac-	1
teristic. One engages in all conceptual differentiation in regard to all dharmas by	1
way of imaginary dharmas¹43. Hence, the knowledge which penetrates [the realization	1
that all is] name-only and which is the counteragent to all conceptual differentiation, is	1
described as the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual character-	1
istic. However, it is not known in this regard whether the latter refers to the individual	1
characteristic in an ultimate sense or in a conventional sense, consequently he asks: in	0

relation to which individual characteristic? Hence he says that this absence of	0
erroneous inversion is:	0
V.18 d	0
In relation to the individual charac-	1
teristic in an ultimate sense.	1
Because the individual characteristic, in an ultimate sense, is inexpressible but not so in	1
a conventional sense. What is the reason? Because the notion that this is name-	1
only in a conventional sense, is not accepted144; for, imaginative construc-	1
tions 145 arise in relation to the essential nature of a dharma through speech; however,	1
this is just in a conventional sense and not in an ultimate sense because it is the process	1
of conceptual differentiation that recognizes that it is name-only. Through this absence	1
of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva becomes skilled in both the conventional and	1
the ultimate.	1
[6] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1
universal characteristic, he says:	1
V.19 ab	0
Since no dharma is to be found out-	1
side the dharmadhātu¹46 etc.	1
For, no dharma whatsoever whether material or non-material is to be found	1
that is exempt from the insubstantiality of the dharmas, because all	1
dharmas are inexpressible and non-dual¹47 by nature since they are devoid of the rela-	1
tion of apprehended object and apprehending subject. Therefore, the dharma-	1
dhātu is the universal characteristic of all dharmas; it is described as the	1
universal characteristic of [all] these existing [dharmas]148 as it is not different in all	1
dharmas. Knowing that this is so is [equivalent to] the absence of erro-	1
neous inversion in relation to the universal characteristic¹49; i.e. in a	1
conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense because the latter is devoid of concep-	1
tual differentiation. Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva	1
becomes skilled in the objective support of purity because it is the object of direct	1
intuition free from conceptual differentiation.	1
[7] How does one distinguish between the universal characteristic and the individual	1
characteristic? The characteristic in the ultimate sense150 lefers to the inexpressible	1
essential nature [which acts] as the counteragent¹51 to the superimposed essential	1

inverted 152 mental activity etc.	1
A lack of purity 153 on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the non-	1
relinquishment of erroneously inverted 154 mental activity; the purity [on	1
its behalf] refers to the relinquishment of that. In this respect, erroneously	1
inverted 155 mental activity is conceptual differentiation that consists in erroneous inver-	1
sion and is the ground of the store-consciousness. The lack of purity on the part of the	1
dharmadhatu refers to the non-relinquishment of the latter 156; purity [on its behalf]	1
refers to its relinquishment. Knowing that this is so is [equivalent to] the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of purity and	1
purity, respectively. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of	1
purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the fact that the non-relinquishment of	1
erroneously inverted 157 mental activity is [equivalent to] the lack of purity on the part	1
of the dharmadhātu. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to its purity refers	1
to the fact that its relinquishment is [equivalent to] purity [on its behalf]. What is the	1
reason? Because the dharmadhatu is defiled by adventitious secondary defilement.	1
This too is an absence of erroneous inversion only in a conventional sense but not in	1
an ultimate sense; and, through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva	1
clearly comprehends: (a) the obscuration to the dharmadhātu that has not been relin-	1
quished and (b) that which has been relinquished.	1
[9] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1
adventitious nature of both the lack of purity and the purity on the part of the dharma-	1
dhātu, he says:	1
V.21 ab	0
...For, the dharmadhitu is pure by	1
nature, like space etc.	1
Moreover, because the dharmadhatu is pure by nature, like space, this	1
pair, i.e. its lack of purity and subsequent purity 158, is adventitious. The	1

lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhātu is mentioned in this regard because it is	0
[superficially] defiled by unreal conceptual differentiation; its purity [is mentioned]	1
because one subsequently relinquishes that [secondary defilement] through the arising	1
of the counteragent and both of these are adventitious to the dharmadhātu. What is the	1
reason? Because the innate purity of the dharmadhātu is like that of space.	1
[Objection]: A lack of purity on the part of what is pure by nature may be adventitious,	1
but, since its purity is an eternal purity, how can it be adventitious? [Response]: This	1
fault is not [applicable] since, in this context, this purity is intended 159 as an absence of	1
stain; only because of this is it stated that its purity is subsequent. Knowing that	1
this is so in regard to the dharmadhătu¹60 is [equivalent to the absence of	1
erroneous inversion in relation to the adventitious nature of both the lack	1
of purity and the purity on the part of the dharmadhătu. This too is [an absence of	1
erroneous inversion] in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense. Through this	1
absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattval61 clearly comprehends the fabricated	1
nature162 of the states of defilement and purification in regard to the dharmadhātu..	1
[10] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1
lack of fear and lack of arrogance, he says:	1
V.22 ab	0
Defilement and purity do not belong	1
to the dharmas nor to the personal	1
entity etc.	1
There is no defilement nor purity on the part of the personal entity 163	1
"nor the dharmas; [the words]: ""defilement and purity"" remain in force in regard to"	1
the latter [i.e. the dharmas]. Here now he provides the reason: because neither the	1
"personal entity exists, nor do the dharmas; [the word] ""exists"" remains in"	1
force in regard to the latter¹64. At the time of the states of defilement and purifi-	1
cation 165, if [an entity] exists separately from defilement and purification it would be	1
tenable to imagine that it can possess defilement or purification, and diminution and	1
increase 166 would also exist separately from that [entity]. [However], there is no	1
personal entity such as that because it is not an object of direct perception or inference.	1
Also, the dharmas which possess an imaginary nature are certainly non-existent	1

because numerous imaginative constructions arise in regard to the one entity, and it is	0
not tenable that the one [entity] can have numerous natures. Consequently, because	1
both the personal entity and the dharmas are non-existent, like the son of an infertile	1
woman etc., there is no defilement or purification; the possession of defilement	0
and purity is not	1
epted 167	0
even on the part of the other-dependent [nature] which is	0
the sphere of pure mundane direct intuition. For what reason? Because it is inex-	1
pressible and non-dual by nature. [Objection]: If [defilement and purity] are not even	1
accepted 168 as belonging to the other-dependent [nature], to which [nature] would they	1
belong for the effort directed towards the relinquishment of defilement and the acquisi-	1
tion of purity169 would be in vain if they [i.e. defilement and purity] did not exist?	1
[Response]: This fault is not [applicable] since defilement and purity belong to the	1
dharmadhātu, [or rather] although they are respectively determined as belonging to the	1
dharmadhātu, they are certainly not identical with it because they are both adventitious	1
to the dharmadhatu 170 and, like space, the dharmadhātu does not change. Hence,	1
concerning the side of defilement, there is no deficiency whatsoever and	1
concerning the side of purification, there is no excellence whatsoever¹71	1
on account of which fear or arrogance [respectively] would result. This	0
is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1
lack of fear and the lack of arrogance.	1
[11] However, others say that in regard to the side of defilement, there is no deficiency	1
on the part of anyone and in regard to the side of purification, there is no excellence172	1
because there is no one who possesses both of these. Since the two do not exist in this	1
"way 173, how, in this respect, can one either fear that: ""this is not mine"", or have the"	1
"prideful notion that: ""this174 excellence belongs to me""?"	1
[12] Others again believe that in the first place the personal entity does not exist and a	1
dharma which experiences the two states and to which the two are imagined to belong	0
also does not exist. On the contrary, this defilement and purification is none other than	1
dependent origination.	1
[13] This too is [intended] in the conventional but not in the absolute sense!	1

the latter is devoid of conceptual differentiation. Through this absence of erroneous	0
inversion, [the bodhisattva] penetrates the unchanging nature of the dharmadhātu	1
because of the absence of decay and growth ¹76.	1
[14] Others believe that [the bodhisattva] goes forth free from obscuration after	1
having relinquished all obscuration through this absence of erroneous inversion.	1
Alternatively, the absence of erroneous inversion in an absolute sense is indicated here	1
by way of the tenfold absences of erroneous inversion which consist in the conven-	1
tional 177, since it is not possible to explain it in any other way. Others say that these	1
absences of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables, object, mental activity, non-	0
dispersal, individual characteristic, universal characteristic, lack of purity, purity, what	1
is adventitious, lack of fear and lack of arrogance also refer to the three natures 178. Of	1
these, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables and object refer to the	1
imaginary nature because both [the notions of] combination and object that has 'fallen'	1
into duality are imaginary. Although they do not have a reality for their object, these	1
two do consist in an absence of erroneous inversion since they are without erroneous	1
inversion as such in this way. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental	1
activity 179 refers to the other-dependent nature because the mental activity that consists	1
in talk is intrinsic to the nature of the store-consciousness. The absence of erroneous	1
inversion ¹80 in relation to non-dispersal181 refers to the perfected nature. Why?	1
Because: (a) direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differentiation is not distracted	1
[by conjecture] about existent or non-existent [entities] and (b) the latter is incorporated	1
in the perfected nature since it is perfection as an absence of erroneous inversion182.	1
The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual and universal charac-	1
teristics refers just to the dharmadhatu because the essential nature of the latter tran-	1
scends the sphere of conceptual differentiation. The absence of erroneous inversion in	0
relation to both the lack of purity and purity refers to a special state of the dharma-	1
dhātu. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to what is adventitious refers to	1
that same dharmadhātu; for it is due to the mental defilement and the mental purity of	1
that which, like space, is pure by nature that the two [purity and its lack] are respec-	1
tively determined as adventitious. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1

lack of fear and the lack of arrogance refers also to the dharmadhātu because of the	0
unfabricated nature of the latter, for, like space, it is devoid of deficiency and	1
excellence. These tenfold absences of erroneous inversion are to be understood in this	1
way in relation to the three natures.	1
The Ten Vajra Words	1
Furthermore, these ton absences of erroneous inversion are to be	1
connected respectively with the ten vajra words. The ten vajra words	1
are: (i) existerce and non-existence, (ii) the absence of erroneous inver-	1
sion, (iii) the basis, (iv) the resemblance to a magical creation, (v) the	1
absence of conceptual differentiation, (vi) intrinsic luminosity, (vii)	1
defilement and purification, (viii) the resemblance to space, (ix) non-	1
deficiency and (x) non-excellence.	1
The 'body' of the vajra words is established by way of: (a) own-	1
being, (b) objective support, (c) absence of conceptual differentiation	1
"and (d) objections and refutations. Of these, (a) ""by way of own-"	1
"being"" refers to the three natures called 'perfected', 'imaginary' and"	1
'other-dependent' corresponding respectively with the first three [vajra]	1
words, 183	1
"(b) ""By way of objective support"" refers to these same"	1
"[three] natures. (c) ""By way of the absence of conceptual differen-"	1
"tiation"" refers to: (i) that on account of which one does not conceptually"	1
differentiate, i.e. direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation,	1
and (ii) that which does not perform conceptual differentiation in regard	1
to intrinsic luminosity. Then, by means of these, the establishment of	1
both the object of knowledge and the act of knowing is to be under-	1
stood respectively, namely, through the three natures and the absence of	1
"conceptual differentiation. (d) ""By way of objections and refutations"""	1
refers to the remaining [vajra] words. This is the objection in this	1
"regard: ""If these dharmas which are characterized by the imaginary and"	1
the other-dependent [natures] are non-existent, how can they be per-	1
ceived? On the other hand if they do exist, the intrinsic luminosity of	1
"the dharmas is not tenable."" One refutes this through their resemblance"	1
to a magical creation, i.e. on the grounds that what comprises a magical	1
"creation does not exist yet it is perceived. [An objection]: ""If the"	1
dharmas possess intrinsic luminosity, how can they be defiled initially	1
The Tib. Bhaşya appears confused in this area and inserts the first of the three antaraśloka here,	0
whereas in the Sanskrit Bhäşya all three are found at the end of this section.Y227	1
"and subsequently purified?"" Its refutation: Defilement and purification"	0
are to be understood according to their resemblance to space, i.e. on the	1
grounds that space, which is pure by nature, can be defiled and then	1
"purified. [An objection]: ""If there is the removal of the moral defile-"	1
ment184 of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings when immeasurable	1
numbers of Buddhas are born, how is it that samsāra is not eradicated	1
"and nirvana is not augmented?"" Its refutation is on the grounds of non-"	1
deficiency and non-excellence, because the realms of sentient beings	1
and 'sides' to purification are immeasurable.	0
Secondly, the 'body' is established as follows:	1
(a) Wherein, whatever and whence is	1
error and (b) wherein and whatever	1
is non-error and indeed (c) the re-	1
sults of both error and non-error and	1
(d) the end of these two.	0
(i) Existence and non-existence, (ii)	1
the absence of erroneous inversion,	0
(iii) the basis, (iv) the resemblance	1
to a magical creation, (v) the absence	1
of conceptual differentiation, (vi)	1
eternal intrinsic luminosity,	0
(vii) Defilement and purification,	0
(viii) the resemblance to space, (ix)	1
non-deficiency and (x) non-excel-	1
lence;	1
These are the ten vajra words.	0
The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma has now been	1
described.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
7226.14 [1] These ten absences of erroneous inversion that have just been described	1
are to be connected respectively with the ten vajra words described in the	1
Sūtras. Which are the ten vajra words? They are: (i) existence and non-	1
existence, (ii) the absence of erroneous inversion, (iii) the basis, (iv)	1
the resemblance to a magical creation, (v) the absence of conceptual	1
Read: klesapagamaḥ in place of klesapasamaḥ; Tib. kun nas ñon mons pa bsal na (D23b.4).	0
Cf. N's fn.2 p.69.311	1
differentiation185, (vi) intrinsic luminosity186, (vii) defilement and	0
purification ¹87, (viii) the resemblance to space, (ix) non-deficiency and	1
(x) non-excellence. These are [of the nature of] a vajra because: (a) like a vajra,	1
they penetrate all erroneous inversion and (b) the former cannot be penetrated by the	1
latter. This is [equivalent to] the knowledge of the absence of erroneous inversion that	1
has just been described [in the last section]. And since this 188 vajra[-like knowledge]	1
is illustrated, i.e. is made known, through them, they are [described as] the vajra	1
words; what is meant is: vajra-like explanations. Furthermore, it is [the ten words of	1
"the previous section] beginning with ""syllable"", ""object"" and ""mental activity"" that are"	1
"signified by the term ""word"". Consequently, ""words of the vajra"" means: 'objective"	1
supports of the vajra; alternatively, these words are described as vajra words because,	1
like a vajra, they are difficult to split189. The vajra words are specifically mentioned in	1
this context because the absences of erroneous inversion must be connected with the	1
Sutras. Alternatively, it is to demonstrate that this explanation of the vajra words is	1
through the ten kinds of absence of erroneous inversion. Of these, (a) the existence or	0
"non-existence of the meaning of syllables is [equivalent to the vajra word] ""existence"	1
"and non-existence""; hence, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables is"	1
"to be known as referring to ""existence and non-existence"" [listed] among the vajra"	1
"words. (b) The appearance as the duality which is imaginary refers to the ""object"" in"	1
this context and the [knowledge] that it is non-existent as such refers to the absence of	1
erroneous inversion in this regard. Thus, the absence of erroneous inversion in rela-	1
"tion to the object is to be connected with the ""absence of erroneous inversion"" [listed]"	1
among the vajra words. (c) Since that same mental activity that consists in talk is a	1
'basis' in this context, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activity is	1
"to be connected with the ""basis"" (listed] among the vajra words. (d) The absence of"	1
erroneous inversion in relation to the non-dispersal of mind, since [it sees in the object]	0
"its resemblance to a magical creation etc, 190, is to be connected with the ""resemblance"	0
"to a magical creation"" [listed] among the vajra words 191. (e) It is that same individual"	1
characteristic of the dharmadhātu that is [equivalent to the absence of conceptual	1
differentiation since it is devoid of imaginative constructions; therefore, the absence of	1
erroneous inversion in relation to the individual characteristic is to be regarded as the	1

dharmadhātu refers to its intrinsic luminosity; therefore, the absence of erroneous	1
"inversion in relation to the universal characteristic is included as ""intrinsic luminosity""."	1
(g) Since a special lack of purity194 and a special purity on the part of the dharmadhātu	1
is [equivalent to] its defilement and purification 195, the absence of erroneous inversion	1
"in relation to the lack of purity and purity is included by [the vajra word] ""defilement"	1
"and purification"". (h) Moreover, the absence of erroneous inversion 196 in relation to"	1
the adventitious nature of defilement and purification on the part of the dharmadhātu is	1
"to be connected with the ""resemblance to space"". (i) & (j) Since there is no destruction"	1
or growth of the dharmadhātu in relation to its states of defilement and purification, the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of arrogance is to	1
"be connected with ""non-deficiency"" and ""non-excellence"" [listed] among the vajra"	1
words. These ten absences of erroneous inversion are to be connected 197 respectively	1
with the ten vajra words in this way.	1
[2] The 'body' of the vajra words is established as follows: the vajra words	1
are employed with reference to 198 certain categories these categories form their body'.	1
However, they are also established as fourfold, i.e. by way of: (a) own-being,	1
(b) objective support, (c) absence of conceptual differentiation and (d)	1
objections and refutations.	1
[3] Of these, the three natures called 'perfected', 'imaginary' and	1
'other-dependent' correspond respectively with the first three [vajra]	1
"words. Therein, the first [three] 199 are: ""existence and non-existence"", ""the absence"	1
"of erroneous inversion"" and ""the basis"". Of these, by ""existence and non-existence"","	1
"the perfected [nature] is referred to; by ""the absence of erroneous inversion"", the"	1
"imaginary [nature] is referred to; by ""the basis"", the other-dependent [nature] is"	1
referred to. How so? Certain people believe that the perfected is explained as both	1
existent and non-existent because it both exists and does not exist200. How can it be	1
due to the fact that the perfected [nature] has the characteristic of both existence and	1
non-existence?201 Some believe that this is because it is verbally expressed as existent	1

and non-existent. Others believe that because syllables possess combination and	0
familiarity, one sees the object as having significance insofar as it is mentally	1
constructed and, in the contrary case, one sees it as being devoid of significance,	1
[thus], it is understood that the perfected nature is inexpressible. Hence, this [vajra	1
"word] ""existence and non-existence"" is said to refer to the perfected nature. Others"	1
again believe that the Dharma that comprises the teachings of the universal vehicle is	1
described as the perfected nature because: (a) it flows out of the extremely pure dharma-	1
dhātu and (b) it is the objective support which acts as counteragent to erroneous inver-	1
sion; and although, as an objective entity its essential nature is conceptually	1
"differentiated 202, it is not imaginary. Hence, [the vajra word] ""existence and non-"	1
"existence"" is said to refer to the perfected. However, others say that ""existence and"	1
"non-existence"" is said to refer to the perfected nature because it is not erroneously"	1
inverted 203. The imaginary is [described] as being without erroneous inversion204	1
because it is characterized 205 by manifesting in the nature of the duality which does not	1
"exist. The other-dependent is described verbally as ""the basis""206; it is described as the"	1
basis because it is the (causal) ground and is described as other-dependent because it is	1
the result.	1
[4] These three natures should be known by way of objective support207.	1
[5] By way of the absence of conceptual differentiation refers to... Since	1
there are different ways of resolving this compound in this context, he says: (i) that	1
on account of which one does not conceptually differentiate, i.e. direct	0
intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation and (ii) that which does	1
not perform conceptual differentiation in regard to intrinsic luminosity.	1
These are the different ways of resolving the compound208 (avikalpanatā): (a) there is	1
an absence of conceptual differentiation (avikalpana) since, on account of this, one	1
does not conceptually differentiate and (b) there is an absence of conceptual differen-	1
tiation (avikalpana) since it [i.e. intrinsic luminosity] is not conceptually differentiated.	1
The state (bhava) of that is [equivalent to] the absence of conceptual differentiation	1
(avikalpanatā). In this way he shows that the absence of conceptual differentiation is	1
revealed by these two vajra words [i.e. avikalpanată and prakṛtiprabhāsvaratā]. Then,	1

and the act of knowing are to be understood respectively, namely 209,	0
through the three natures and the absence of conceptual differentiation.	0
Therein, the object of knowledge is established through the three natures because they	1
consist in the apprehended object; the act of knowing is established through the	1
absence of conceptual differentiation because it consists in the apprehending subject.	1
[6] By way of objections and refutations that are employed refers to the	1
remaining vajra words210, With regard to this, certain vajra words actually are	1
"refutations of objections; examples of these are ""the resemblance to a magical creation"","	1
"""the resemblance to space"", ""non-deficiency"" and ""non-excellence"". However, some"	1
"[vajra words] are just objections, for example, ""defilement and purification"". There-"	1
"fore, [the vajra word] ""objections and refutations"" (codyaparihara) can be [interpreted"	1
both as] 'refutations of objections' and 'objections'; together they produce 'objections	1
and refutations' (codyaparihārau)211, considering the rule (cf. Panini III.1.94 & I.II.64)	1
that of two 'original' words (i.e. codyaparihara and codya), only one remains (i.e.	1
"codyaparihārau). This212 is the objection in this regard: ""If these dharmas"	1
which are characterized by the imaginary and other-dependent [natures]	1
are non-existent..., the ellipsis is: as apprehended object and apprehending subject,	0
how can they be perceived? I.e., as apprehended object and apprehending subject	1
this is what is intended. On the other hand if they do exist, the intrinsic	1
"luminosity of the dharmas is not tenable""; because they exist in the aspects of"	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject - this is the objection. One refutes	0
this through their resemblance to a magical creation, i.e. on the grounds	1
that what comprises a magical creation does not exist yet it is perceived.	1
For a magical creation exists as a perception; consequently, its existence as such cannot	1
be known. An objection: if the dharmas possess intrinsic luminosity, how	1
can they be defiled initially213 and subsequently purified? For, if they are	1
pure by nature, the defiled state is never possible. Its refutation: Defilement and	1
purification are to be understood according to their resemblance with	0
space, i.e. on the grounds that space, which is pure by nature214, can be	1

defiled by adventitious secondary defilement and then, due to the removal of the	0
latter, purified 215. Thus, although it is pure by nature, the defilement on the part of	1
the dharmadhātu is on account of adventitious secondary defilement and purification	1
"[on its behalf] is due to the removal of the latter. An objection: ""If there is the"	0
removal of the moral defilement216 of immeasurable numbers of sentient	1
beings when immeasurable numbers of Buddhas are born, how is	1
that217, although the Buddhas are born individually in beginningless samsåra,	1
samsara is not eradicated and nirvapa is not augmented due to the removal	1
of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings from samsāra and their entry to nirvāṇa?	1
Its refutation is on the grounds of non-deficiency and non-excellence,	1
because the realms of sentient beings and 'sides' to purification are	1
immeasurable. For, the diminution or eradication of something which possesses	1
limitations can be conceived218 but the realm of sentient beings is immeasurable and its	1
diminution cannot be conceived, how much less can its eradication, like that of space,	1
possibly be conceived? Since there is indeed no excellence of purification too because	1
of its immeasurable nature, how can there be augmentation on its part, like with space,	1
because both the removal of obscuration and the arising of obscuration belong to it?	1
[7] Secondly, the 'body' is established 219 as follows, i.e. with reference to	1
the vajra words:	1
(a) Wherein, whatever and whence is	1
error and (b) wherein and whatever	1
is non-error and indeed (c) the	1
results of both error and non-error	1
and (d) the end of these two.	0
The object of error, the essential nature of error220, the cause of error, the result of error	1
and the end of the result of error221 are explained by the vajra words. Similarly, the	1
essential nature of non-error, the object of non-error, the result of non-error and the	1
"end result of the latter222 are explained 223. In regard to the above [verse], ""wherein"	1
"there is error"" refers to existence and non-existence, i.e. the characterizing of syllables"	1
as having significance or being without significance, because the verbal expression and	1
the object of the expression and the connection between them is imaginatively con-	1

through their resemblance to a magical creation and the absence of conceptual differen-	1

"refers to intrinsic luminosity which has the characteristic of the perfected nature. ""And"	1

error is purification because it is the result of the absence of error the ellipsis is -	1
"[purification] together with its associates. The use of the particle ""indeed"" refers to"	1
these two results described by [the vajra word] 'defilement and purification'; however,	1
in order to demonstrate that through [the vajra word] 'the resemblance to space', the	1
results of both error and the absence of error on the part of the dharmadhātu is seen to	1
"have the nature of defilement and purification, but they are not intrinsic to it. ""And the"	1
"end of these two"": some people believe that this refers to the end of both defilement"	1
and purification, i.e. nirvāṇa; moreover, the latter is described as the 'end'226 insofar as	1
it is without deficiency and excellence. However, others believe that the end of defile-	1
ment is [equivalent to] the possession of non-deficiency because [defilement] does not	1
accumulate due to the immeasurable nature of samsära; and the end of purification is	1
[equivalent to] the possession of non-excellence227 because [purification] does not	1
increase due to the immeasurable nature of nirvāṇa.	1

words.	1
[9] In this context, (a) the view that the connection between a word and its object	1
belongs to the perfected [nature] is erroneous inversion. (b) The view that objects exist	1
by way of essential nature in exactly that way in which they appear is erroneous inver-	1
sion. (c) The view [that incorporates] the cause for the arising of the object is erro-	1
neous inversion 230, (d) The views that [incorporate] imputation or negation in regard	1
to the object are erroneous inversion. (e) The view that the own-being of the object is	1
in accord with its nominal designation231 is erroneous inversion. (f) & (g) The views	1
that regards the individual or universal characteristics 232 of entities as substantially	1
existent are erroneous inversion. (h) The view that the purity or the lack of purity of	1
actions is due to auspicious or inauspicious behaviour is erroneous inversion. The	1
view that both the lack of purity and purity belong to one and the same [entity] is erro-	1
neous inversion. (i) & (j) The manifestation of fear and arrogance because of the belief	1
in deficiency and excellence in regard to the relinquishment and acquisition of defile-	1
ment and purification [respectively] is erroneous inversion. These are the ten	1
erroneous inversions; because they are non-existent on the part of the bodhisattva, [the	1
spiritual practice] which becomes free from erroneous inversion in relation to the cate-	1
gories as described should be known as the meditative development of penetrating	1
insight233. The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma has now	0

d. Spiritual Practice in Relation to the Avoidance	1
of the Two Extremes.	1
Which is the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two	1
extremes? That which is taught as the middle way in the Ratnakūţa.	1
This is to be known as being due to the avoidance of which extremes?	1
V.23 abcd	1
V.24 abcd	1
V.25 abcd	1
V.26 abcd	1
The extremes concerning separate-	1
ness and identity, those of the	1
tirthika and śravaka, the twofold	1
extremes of imputation and negation	1
in regard to the personal entity and	1
the dharmas.	1
The extremes concerning adverse	1
elements and their counteragents,	1
those termed eternalism and annihi-	1
lationism, the twofold and threefold	1
[extremes] concerning the appre-	0
hended object and apprehending	1
subject as well as defilement and	0
purification.	1
The seven kinds of dual extremes	1
consisting in conceptual differentia-	1
tion are also considered in regard to:	1
(a) existent and non-existent entities,	1
(b) the object of appeasement and the	1
[act of] appeasing, (c) the object of	1
fear and the dread of the latter;	0
(d) The apprehended object and	0
apprehending subject, (e) correctness	1
and falsity, (f) performance and	1
non-performance] and (g) non-	1
origination and simultaneity these	1
are the dual extremes that consist in	1
conceptual differentiation.	1
Of these, (a) the notion that the self is something separate from form	1
etc. is one extreme; the notion that it is identical is another extreme.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. that	1
which does not investigate a self, concluding with the non-investigation319	0
of the human kind, for, among the views concerning a self, there is one	1
view that holds the individual soul to be [identical with the physical	1
body and [another view that holds] the individual soul to be one [entity]	1
and the physical body another.	1
The notion that form is permanent is an extreme embraced by the	1
tirthikas; the notion that it is impermanent is an extreme embraced by	1
the śrävakas. The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of	1
these, i.e. that which does not investigate the permanence, nor does it	1
investigate the impermanence, of form etc.	1
The notion that the self exists234 is the extreme of imputation in	1
regard to the personal entity; the notion that it is insubstantial is the	1
extreme of negation, for, there is the negation of just that which exists	1
as a designation. The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both	1
of these, i.e. the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation	1
which holds the mean position between [the existence of a self and its	1
insubstantiality.	1
The notion that mind is real is the extreme of imputation in regard to	1
the dharmas; the notion that it is not real is the extreme of negation.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. that	1
[perspective] wherein there is no mind, nor volition, nor thought, nor	0
consciousness.	1
The notion that the dharmas, such as those that are unwholesome,	1
are [equivalent to] defilement is an extreme in regard to adverse	1
elements; the notion that the wholesome ones etc. are [equivalent to]	1
purification is an extreme in regard to the counteragent. The middle	1
way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. that which con-	1
sists in the non-acceptance, non-utterance and non-communication of	0
these two extremes.	1
The notion that both the personal entity and the armas exist is the	1
extreme of eternalism; the notion that they do not exist is the extreme of	1
annihilationism. The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of	1
these since it holds a mean position between the two extremes.	1
The notion that nescience consists in the apprehended object and	1
apprehending subject 235 is one extreme; likewise the notion that know-	1
ledge, the formative forces and the unconditioned which is the counter-	0
agent to the latter, up until old-age and death, consist in the	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject is another extreme.	0
Tib. inserts yod (D305b.3) which is not found in the Sanskrit.	0
235 Read: grahika which accords with the Bhasya Ms.(cf. N's fn. 12 p.70) and Ţika quotation	1
(Ms.78a.5); cf. my fn.273 below.4	1
Alternatively, the notion that the cessation of these consists in the	1
apprehended object and apprehending subject is an extreme, i.e. it is	0
checked by that path. Thus, the extremes in regard to the apprehended	1
object and apprehending subject are twofold according to their differ-	1
entiation as belonging to the 'black' or the 'white' side.	1
The middle way	1
is for the purpose of avoiding both of these. i.e. in detail, both know-	1
ledge and nescience are non-dual because of the absence of the	1
apprehended object and the apprehending subject on the part of know-	1
ledge and nescience etc.	1
Defilement is threefold: (a) the defilement of moral defilement, (b)	1
the defilement of action and (c) the defilement of rebirth. In regard to	1
these, the defilement of moral defilement is threefold: (i) false view, (ii)	1
the causes of passion, aversion and delusion and (iii) the resolve for a	0
new existence. The counteragents to these are: (i) emptiness know-	1
ledge, (ii) signless knowledge and (iii) non-resolve knowledge. The	1
defilement of action refers to the formative influence of virtuous and	1
non-virtuous actions. The counteragent to these is knowledge without	1
formative influence. The defilement of rebirth refers to: (i) rebirth in a	1
new existence, (ii) the production of the mind and the mental concomi-	1
tants every moment in one who is reborn and- (iii) the continuance of a	1
new existence. The counteragents to these are: (i) non-birth knowledge,	0
(ii) non-production knowledge and (iii) absence of own-being know-	1
ledge. The removal of these three kinds of defilement is [equivalent to]	1
purification. In this regard, through emptiness knowledge etc. the	1
dharmas that are the objects of emptiness knowledge etc., up to [the	1
dharmas that are the objects of the absence of own-being knowledge],	1
are not respectively caused to be emptiness etc. on account of these	1
three kinds of defilement, [rather], they are emptiness etc. by their very	1
nature because the dharmadhatu is undefiled by nature. Therefore, if	1
one imagines that the dharmadhatu is defiled or is purified, this is an	1
extreme because there can be no defilement or purity on the part of that	1
which is undefiled by nature. The middle way is for the purpose of	1
avoiding this extreme, i.e. that which does not cause the dharmas to be	1
empty through emptiness; on the contrary the dharmas	1
are already	1
empty and the same holds for the other [six categories of knowledge].	1
There are	1
an additional seven kinds of dual extremes that consist in	1
conceptual differentiation, for example, the conceptual differentiation in	1
"regard to an existent entity is one extreme and the conceptual differen-""2"	1
tiation in regard to a non-existent entity is another extreme236. These	1
are due to imagining that: (a) emptiness is for the destruction of the	1
belief in the existence of the personal entity, or else, (b) insubstantiality	1
is non-existent. This middle way is for the purpose of avoiding these	1
dual extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation. Emptiness is	1
certainly not for the destruction of the belief in the personal entity,	1
moreover, emptiness itself is empty. In detail, the same holds for past	1
emptiness and future emptiness etc.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the object of appeasement is	1
one extreme and conceptual differentiation in regard to the [act of]	1
appeasing is another extreme. These are on account of imaginative con-	1
structions in regard to the object of relinquishment and the [act of]	0
relinquishing which are due to fear of emptiness. The example of	1
'space' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in	1
conceptual differentiation.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the object of fear is one	1
extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the dread of that	1
object of fear [is another extreme]. These result from fear of imaginary	1
forms etc. and are on account of the dread of suffering. The example of	1
the 'painter' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that con-	1
sist in conceptual differentiation. The former example is in relation to	0
the śrävaka, but the latter is [in relation to] the bodhisattva.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is one	1
extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the apprehending	1
subject [is another extreme]. The example of the 'magician' is for the	1
purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual	1
differentiation. For, the knowledge of the non-existence of the object is	1
caused by the knowledge of representation-only and the knowledge of	1
the non-existence of the object annuls that very knowledge of repre-	1
sentation-only because, if the object is non-existent, its representation	1
is not possible; thus, these two are similar in this respect.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to correctness is one extreme	1
and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to falsity [is another extreme].	1
Both of these conceptually differentiate the investigation of what is real	1
as correct or false. The example of 'fire coming from two sticks' is for	1
the purpose of avoiding these two extremes; i.e., just as fire is gener-	1
ated from two sticks which are devoid of the characteristic of fire and	1
[the fire] that is generated consumes those two sticks; similarly, the	1
"236 Tika and Tib. Bhaşya confirm a reading of abhave 'pi vikalpo 'ntah; cf. N's fn.14 p.71."""	0
noble faculty of wisdom which has the characteristic of correctness is	0
generated from the investigation [of phenomenal as they are in reality	1
which is devoid of the characteristic of correctness and [the faculty of	0
wisdom] that is generated annihilates [through clear understanding] that	1
investigation of what is real; thus, these two are similar in this respect.	0
And although the investigation of what is real is devoid of the charac-	1
teristic of correctness, it does not have the characteristic of falsity	1
because it is in conformity with correctness.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action is	1
one extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the non-per-	1
formance of action [is another extreme]. Both of these imagine direct	1
intuition to involve an act that is preceded by intelligence, or else, as	1
being devoid of efficacy. The example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the	1
purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual	1
differentiation.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination is one	1
extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to simultaneity [is	1
another extreme], i.e., if one imagines that the counteragent does not	1
arise, or else, [imagines] defilement to endure for a long time. The	1
second example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the purpose of avoiding these	1
two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
The spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two	1
extremes has now been described.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y233.9 [1] Immediately following the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma, the	1
spiritual practice that relates to the avoidance of the two extremes237 should be	1
mentioned. Hence he asks: which is the spiritual practice in relation to the	1
avoidance of the two extremes? So he says: that which is taught as the	1
middle way in the Dharma discourse named the Ratnakūta for the purpose of	1
illustrating the essential nature of correct spiritual practice. In detail, it is taught as	1
follows concluding with the second example of the 'oil-lamp¹238:	1
"""In this matter, O Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva who desires instruction through"	1
the Dharma discourse, the Maha239 Ramakūṭa, should apply himself properly to	1
the Dharma. And as to what is proper application to the Dharma: namely, it is	1

extremes?242 What is meant is: the spiritual practice of the middle way should be	0
known as being due to the avoidance of which extremes? Hence he says:	1
V.23 ab	0
The extremes concerning separate-	1
ness and identity, those of the	1
dirthika and śrävaka etc.	1
These fifteen types are differentiated into two extremes; this [the middle way] is to be	1
known as being due to the avoidance of these. In this regard, the views concerning	1
separateness etc. 2	0
243 are extremes considering that there is the figurative use of a cause	1
in regard to the effect because one becomes notionally attached each to his own view.	1
Of these, the notion that the self is something separate from form etc. is	1
one extreme; the notion that it is identical is another extreme. In this	1
respect, those [views] which construe form etc., the aggregates, the sense-fields and	1
the elements as entities to be enjoyed on the part of an eternally existing self are	1
[equivalent to] the extreme view which holds the self to be something separate from	1
form etc. Again, the extreme view that the self is identical to form etc. refers to those	1
[views] which hold the internal formative forces consisting in form etc. to be the self	1
and which construe that which sees, hears and discerns 244 as the self, and external	1
things as belonging to the self. There is one view, expressed in a Sūtra, that	1
holds the individual soul to be [identical with] the physical body and	1
[another view that holds] the individual soul to be one [entity] and the	1
"physical body another these are described by the word ""extreme"" in this context."	0
For the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. for the purpose of avoiding245	1
the extremes of identity and difference of the self246 in relation to form etc., there is	0
the middle way247, i.e. direct intuition that has for its object only the dharmas. In	1
order to demonstrate this, he says: i.e. that which does not investigate a self,	1
concluding with the non-investigation of a human being. For, when [the	1

bodhisattva] understands that the self is non-existent, like the son of an infertile	0
woman, due to the insight that it is only dharmas, he does not see a self; what is meant	1
is: he does not adhere to [the belief in a self]. What is the reason that its identity or	1
difference is perceived in relation to form etc. and why is [the self] mentioned by	1
"special synonyms 248, such as ""sentient being"" when it is understood in that sense just"	1
"by the word ""self""? Since all [people] do not understand all synonyms, it is explained"	1
through another synonym in order that everyone can understand its meaning. Alterna-	1
tively, it is for the purpose249 of conveying its meaning through different synonyms to	1
those who were distracted at a particular time because when it is mentioned through	1
that description, it is conveyed to others.	1
[3] The notion that form is permanent250 is an extreme embraced by the	1
tirthikas. For, having become attached to imaginary form as an entity, they construe	1
it to be permanent because they are misled through erroneously inverting it as perma-	1
nent. The notion that it is impermanent is an extreme embraced by the	1
śrävakas. This is an extreme because they impute a substantial although imperma-	1
nent nature251 upon form etc. whose essential nature is imaginary. The view that	1
[form] is impermanent is an extreme because it causes one to shrink excessively from	1
samsāra and to fall into an extreme in regard to nirvana. For the purpose of	1
avoiding both of these 252, i.e. for the purpose of avoiding the views [of form] as	1
permanent or impermanent, there is the middle way, i.e. that which does not	1
investigate permanence, nor does it investigate the impermanence, of	1
form etc. Just what is this [middle way]? It is direct intuition free from conceptual	1
differentiation, i.e. that which does not understand form etc. just in relation to [entities	1
"of] form etc. or as permanent or impermanent. The word ""etc."" in the term ""form"	1
"etc.""253 refers to the [four other] aggregates of sensation, ideation, the formative forces"	1
and consciousness, the elements of earth, water, fire, wind and space and the sense-	1
fields of sight, hearing, smell, taste, tactility and mind.	0
[4] The notion that the self exists is the extreme of imputation in regard	1
to the personal entity. The [view] which regards the self, which is non-existent in	1
actuality 254 like the son of an infertile woman, as separate or not separate from the	1
aggregates, elements or sense-fields is an extreme because it imputes255 the self, in the	1
nature of an entity, upon the personal entity. The notion that it is insubstantial	1

is the extreme of negation. For, negation is described as imagining that some-	0
thing existent is non-existent256. But if the self does not exist, how can its description	1
as 'insubstantial' be an extreme of negation? For, there is the negation of just	1
that which exists as a designation257. It is an extreme which negates [the exis-	1
tence] as something insubstantial that is referred to. Moreover, it is a continuum of	1
dharmas wherein the close connection of cause and result is evident. Alternatively, it is	1
a totality in regard to which the designation as god or human [is made]. The middle	1
way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. for the purpose of	1
avoiding the views that the self exists or does not exist; and now, in order to define	1
what is the middle way258, he says: i.e. that which holds the mean position 259	1
between [the existence of a self and its insubstantiality; but what does that	0
mean consist in? Direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.	1
[5] Having shown that conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is	1
an extreme [and] in order to demonstrate that conceptual differentiation260 in regard to	1
the apprehending subject is also an extreme, he says: the notion that mind is real	1
etc. Alternatively, after showing that imputation and negation in regard to the	0
personal entity is an extreme and in order to show the extremes of imputation and	1
"negation in regard to the dharmas, he says: ""the notion that mind is real etc."". The"	1
notion that mind exists as a reality in exactly that way in which it appears, or, as it is	1
expressed 261. this is the extreme of imputation in regard to the dharmas,	1
because the own-being of mind 262 which is without reality, is imputed as real. The	1
notion that mind is not real is the extreme of negation. The view which	1
regards [mind] as unreal although existent in a nature devoid of the apprehended object	1
and apprehending subject and inexpressible is an extreme of negation because it com-	1
pletely negates the own-being of the dharmas. For the purpose of avoiding both	1
of these, i.e. for the purpose of penetrating the insubstantiality of the dharmas which	1
is devoid of imputation and negation, there is the middle way, i.e. that	1
[perspective] wherein there is no mind, nor volition, nor thought, nor	1
consciousness263; the ellipsis is that the notional attachment (to mind etc.] does [not]	1

occur264. Alternatively, that sphere within which mind does not arise in its nature as a	1
collection 265 of latent impressions accompanied by impurity, nor does volition [arise]	1
characterized by formative influence266, nor does thought in the aspect of self-conceit	1
[arise], nor does consciousness [arise] as conceptual differentiation - this is described	1
"as the middle way. Therein, ""mind"" refers to the store-consciousness since it is the"	1
"collection of latent impressions of all dharmas accompanied by impurity. ""Volition"""	1
refers to the actions of mind and consists in the actions that stimulate mind toward the	1
"wholesome, the unwholesome and the neutral. ""Thought"" refers to defiled mind."	1
"""Consciousness"" refers to the six groups of consciousness."	1
[6] The notion that the dharmas, such as those that are unwholesome,	1
are [equivalent to] defilement is an extreme in regard to adverse	1
elements; the notion that the wholesome ones etc. are [equivalent to]	1
purification is an extreme in regard to the counteragent. By the word	1
"""etc."", the explanations [of dharmas] are referred to that are reprehensible267, not repre-"	1
hensible, mundane, supramundane, with and without impurity, conditioned and	1
unconditioned etc. In this respect, the extreme in regard to adverse elements and the	1
extreme in regard to the counteragent refers to the notion that defilement and purifi-	1
cation are exactly [equivalent to] the mode in which the unwholesome and wholesome	1
dharmas appear and are articulated. Therein [the dharmas] are unwholesome because	1
they have the sense of discomfort; they are reprehensible because they cause the mani-	1
festation of bad conduct; they are mundane because they are erroneously inverted; they	1
are accompanied by impurity because they have a propensity towards impurity; they	1
are conditioned because they are produced from causal conditions. However, the	1
wholesome ones etc. should be known as the inverse of these. The middle way is	0
"for the purpose of avoiding both of these; the term ""both of these"" refers to"	1
the adverse element and the counteragent. Since the middle way is not known in rela-	1
tion to this, he says: that which consists in the non-acceptance, non-utter-	1
ance and non-communication of these two extremes. Of these, non-	1
acceptance 268 refers to the absence of the notional attachment to adverse elements and	1
the counteragent. It is non-utterance because it does not cause others to accept these	1
extremes in regard to adverse elements and the counteragent. It is non-communication	1

because it does not recommend 269 [to others] the extremes 270 in regard to adverse	1
elements and the counteragent.	1
[7] Having taught the middle way [which acts as counteragent to the extremes	1
embraced by the tirthikas and śrāvakas and in order to clearly illustrate the middle way	1
[which acts] as counteragent to the extremes pertinent to the bodhisattva, he says: the	1
notion that both the personal entity and the dharmas exist is the extreme	1
of eternalism; the notion that they do not exist is the extreme of annihi-	1
lationism. The notion that they exist at all times is the extreme of eternalism because	1
of the imputation of the individual characteristic; the notion that they do not exist is the	1
extreme of annihilationism because their essential nature is negated, in every respect.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these since it	1
holds a mean position between the two extremes. Some believe that the	1
"""mean"" in this context is intended as being separate from both extremes. Others main-"	1
"tain that the ""mean"" here lies between these two extremes 271 and has the characteristic"	1
of both. Having considered [these two views], how [should it be understood]? The	1
extreme of eternalism refers to the notional attachment to the view that an entity that is	1
an object both of knowledge and verbal description, like the imagination of what is	1
unreal or the dharmadhātu, exists substantially and in an ultimate sense - [this is an	1
extreme] because these [entities] do not exist as such. Similarly 272, the view that [an	1
entity] definitely does not exist, like the horns of a hare, is the extreme of annihila-	1
tionism. What is the reason? Because it does exist as a designation. Hence, since it	1
denies [the existence of the latter, it is described as the extreme of annihilationism.	1
Consequently, that which holds the mean position between existence and non-existence	1
has the characteristic of both since it does not exist substantially nor in an ultimate	1
sense and does exist as a designation.	1
[8] With reference to the extreme of imputation in regard to the adverse elements and	1
their counteragent, he says: the notion that nescience consists in the appre-	1
hended object and apprehending subject273 is one extreme; likewise the	1
notion that knowledge, the formative forces and the unconditioned,	1
which is the counteragent to the latter, consists in the apprehended	1
object and apprehending subject, is another extreme. Moreover, because of	1
the reference here to the final member [of the twelve nidäna by the words]: up until	1
old-age and death, consciousness and name/form etc. are also included. The notion	1
that consciousness consists in the apprehended object and apprehending subject is an	1

extreme; similarly, the notion that name/form, the six sense-fields, contact, sensation,	0
craving, grasping, becoming, birth and also old-age and death, consist in the appre-	1
hended object and apprehending subject is also an extreme. Therein, nescience	1
consists in an absence of the knowledge of the [four] truths and the [three] jewels. The	1
formative forces are impure volitions which have meritorious, demeritorious and	1
neutral274 [tendencies] for their own-being because they are the formative influences	1
for the new existence. Similarly, consciousness etc. should be stated in detail in a way	1
that conforms with the explanations [given in the section entitled]: The Characteristic	1
of Defilement¹275. Knowledge refers to direct intuition devoid of impurity. The	1
counteragent to the formative forces refers just to direct intuition that is unconditioned;	1
it is only hence276 and in order to distinguish it from other unconditioned [elements]	1
"that he says: ""the counteragent to the latter"". However, others consider that in this"	0
respect the unconditioned is also eightfold277 because of the fact that it possesses non-	1
origination; but the counteragent refers to volition that is without impurity278 because it	1
does not formatively influence the new existence. Alternatively, the notion that	1
the cessation of these consists in the apprehended object and appre-	1
"hending subject is an extreme. By the word ""these"", (the nidänal beginning"	1
with consciousness and concluding with old-age and death, are referred to. Since it is	0
not known whether sensation is an entity or a cause, he says: it, i.e. name/form, is	1
checked by that...; by what is name/form checked? By the path which is without	1
impurity and which is the counteragent to name/form. Knowledge and nescience	1
which are non-dual do not make a duality, thus, in this context the path is comprised	1
only by direct intuition together with its associated elements. Consequently 279, since	1
[name/form] is checked by this [i.e. the path], there is cessation; but what is the	0
extreme here280? Just the notional attachment to the apprehended object and appre-	1
hending subject. What is the reason? Because the imposition of a non-existing duality	1
occurs in regard to nescience etc. which are non-dual by nature281. Thus, the	1
extremes in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject	1
are twofold according to their differentiation as belonging to the 'black'	1
or the 'white' side. There in, the 'black' side refers to the twelve limbs that consist	1
in becoming, i.e. from nescience up until old-age and death. Likewise, the 'white' side	1
refers to the same twelve modes according to their differentiation as the cessation of	1

nescience etc., i.e. from the cessation of ignorance up until the cessation of old-age and	0
death. Moreover, in this context, it is just the path that is the counteragent to these	1
"[twelve] that is signified by the word ""cessation"" since ignorance etc. is checked on"	1
account of it. For the purpose of avoiding these, i.e. for the purpose of avoid-	1
ing the extremes that consist in the apprehended object and apprehending subject282,	1
the middle way is mentioned, i.e. is referred to. And since the latter283 is not	1
known, he says: both knowledge and nescience are non-dual. How can	1
knowledge and nescience, up until old-age and death and the cessation of the latter, be	1
non-dual? Hence he says: because of the absence of the apprehended object	0
and apprehending subject on the part of knowledge and nescience etc.	1
However, that absence is because of the fact that nescience etc. is non-dual by nature.	1
Alternatively, since both knowledge and nescience have an imaginary nature, know-	1
ledge and nescience are non-dual since the non-existence of both knowledge and	1
nescience, which have an imaginary nature, is the same. It should be stated similarly	1
for the formative forces, the unconditioned, consciousness and the cessation of the	1
latter, up until old-age and death and its cessation. But what is the middle way in this	1
context? Just this knowledge that, since knowledge and nescience are non-dual284 and	1
do not make a duality 285, the knowledge to be generated is non-existent and the	1
nescience to be checked is non-existent, the formative forces to be relinquished are	1
non-existent and the cessation of the latter which is to be attained is non-existent. The	1
knowledge that this is so is the non-making of duality286	1
[9] Defilement is threefold. In this respect, moral defilements 287 are described as	1
defilements either because: (a) they cause the defilements of action and rebirth and (b)	1
they are defiled in themselves; alternatively, it is because they cause disturbance to	1
oneself and others. Action is also described as defilement, because: (a) it develops	1
under the influence of moral defilement, (b) it is the cause of rebirth and (c) certain	1
[actions] are morally defiled in themselves. Rebirth too is [described as] defilement	1
because it is both the cause288 of the moral defilement of action and it is the basis of all	1
misfortune289. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the threefold differentiation of the	1
defilement of moral defilements, he says: the defilement of moral defilement is	1
threefold etc. Of these, (i) false view refers to the five beginning with the false	0

view of individuality. (ii) Passion, aversion and delusion indeed are causes	0
because they are causes of grief etc. and the new existence. However, others say that	1
the causes of passion etc. are: the sense faculties and objects conducive to it, superficial	1
mental attention and the latent impressions of passion etc. that are lodged in the store-	1
consciousness; but they claim that they, as they appear as these [i.e. passion etc.], are	1
the cause of passion etc. (iii) The resolve for a new existence; i.e. the desire	1
for a new existence. The counteragents to these are: (i) emptiness know-	1
ledge etc. Of these, the counteragent to false views is emptiness knowledge; in this	1
context, emptiness knowledge refers to knowledge that has emptiness for its object.	1
The counteragent to the cause of passion etc. is (ii) signless knowledge because it	1
is devoid of all signs. Alternatively, signless knowledge refers to knowledge that has	1
the signless for its object because it has the emptiness of imaginary passion etc. for its	1
object. The counteragent to the resolve for the new existence is non-resolve	1
knowledge. Non-resolve knowledge 290 refers to knowledge that is either devoid of	1
the resolve for the new existence, or else, which has the emptiness of the new existence	1
for its object. The defilement of action refers to the formative influence of	1
virtuous and non-virtuous actions 291. Formative influence refers to the	1
accumulation and actualization of the actions, both virtuous and non-virtuous, which	1
project the new existence. The counteragent to these is knowledge without	1
formative influence. Knowledge without formative influence refers to that know-	1
ledge, on account of which, one's actions do not formatively influence the new	1
existence; and this has thusness for its object. The defilement of rebirth refers	0
to: (i) the birth in a new existence, i.e. the mind at conception; (ii) the aris-	1
ing of the mind and the mental concomitants every moment in one who	1
has been born, i.e. subsequent to conception, up until death 292; and (iii) the	1
continuance of the new existence, i.e. the death state in accompaniment with	1
moral defilement which is followed immediately by the intermediate state293 and	1
following from the latter comes the rebirth state. However, for those who have gained	1
the formless attainments, the rebirth state follows immediately after the death state.	1
The counteragents to these are: (i) non-birth knowledge, (ii) non-	1
production knowledge and (iii) the absence of own-being knowledge.	1
Of these, the non-birth knowledge refers to the knowledge that all dharmas are 'unborn'	1
since they have the nature of imaginative construction; alternatively, it is that which has	1
emptiness for its object294. The non-production knowledge refers to the knowledge	0

that has for its object the emptiness of the imaginary dharmas because one penetrates	0
their non-production on account of this [knowledge]. The absence of own-being	1
knowledge refers to the knowledge that the continued existence of an entity 295 is	1
devoid of own-being, because, like the son of an infertile woman, it does not exist.	1
These seven kinds of knowledge beginning with emptiness knowledg are the counter-	1
agents to the seven kinds of adverse elements beginning with false view as have just	1
been described. The removal of these three kinds of defilement consisting in	1
moral defilement, action and rebirth which are differentiated as sevenfold is	1
[equivalent to] purification; 'removal' [has the sense of] relinquishment. How-	1
ever, others believe that purification refers to thusness, the path and nirvana because	1
the resolution of the term [apagama] is as follows: [defilement] departs (apagacchau) in	1
it [i.e. tathată], by means of it [i.e. märga] and there is the departure itself [i.e. nirvāṇa],	0
therefore, purification refers to thusness etc. In this regard, ...through empti-	0

formative influence, non-birth knowledge, non-production knowledge and absence of	1

"knowledge etc....; and here too, by the word ""etc."", the following are included: the"	0
object of emptiness knowledge, the object of signless knowledge, the object of non-	1
resolve knowledge, the object of knowledge without formative influence296, the object	1
of non-birth knowledge, the object of non-production knowledge and the object of the	1
absence of own-being knowledge all of which are characterized by the perfected	1
[nature]. Up to [the dharmas that are the objects of the absence of own-	1
being knowledge), are not respectively caused to be emptiness etc. on	0
account of these three kinds of defilement; i.e. the dharmas that are the object	1
of emptiness knowledge etc., which are separate from the defilements of moral defile-	1
ment, action and rebirth that were just described, are not caused [to be empty etc.]	1
through emptiness knowledge etc. 297 What is the reason that they are not caused [to be	1
empty etc.]? Because they are emptiness etc. by their very nature. What is	1
meant is: they are devoid of the own-being of false view etc. by their very nature. As	1
to why this is so, he says: because the dharmadhātu is undefiled by nature.	1
Hence, since the dharmas that are the object of emptiness knowledge etc. are emptiness	1
etc. by their very nature, they are not caused [to be empty etc.] through emptiness	1

of false view, is not caused 298 [to be empty] through emptiness knowledge299 because	0
the emptiness of false view is, in itself, devoid of the own-being of false view. Thus,	1
the object of signless knowledge which is devoid of the sign of passion etc. is not	1
caused [to be signless] through signless knowledge because the emptiness of the sign	1
of passion etc. is, in itself, signless. The object of non-resolve knowledge is not	1
caused [to be non-resolve] through non-resolve knowledge because the emptiness of	1
resolve is, by its very nature, characterized by non-resolve300. The object of know-	1
ledge without formative influence is not caused [to be devoid of formative influence]	1
through knowledge that is without formative influence because the emptiness of	1
formative influence is, by its very nature, characterized by the absence of formative	1
influence. The object of non-birth knowledge is not caused [to be non-born] through	1
non-birth knowledge because the emptiness of birth is, by its very nature, characterized	1
by non-birth. The object of non-production knowledge 301 is not caused [to be non-	1
produced] through non-production knowledge because the emptiness of the production	1
of the mind and the mental concomitants every moment is, by its very nature, charac-	1
terized by non-production. The object of the absence of own-being knowledge is not	1
caused [to be devoid of own-being] through the absence of own-being knowledge	1
because the emptiness of the new existence is, by its very nature, devoid of own-being.	1
"Alternatively, the statement: ""...respectively...on account of the three kinds of defile-"	1
"ment etc."", [can be interpreted as follows]: a particular dharma of the dharmas that are"	1
objects of emptiness knowledge etc. which has a connection with the defilements of	1
moral defilement, action and rebirth that are differentiated as sevenfold, i.e. with a	1
particular variety of defilement, is not caused [to be emptiness ] 302 through emptiness	1
knowledge etc.; on the contrary, it is understood (adhigamyate) [to be emptiness]. In	1
this respect, emptiness knowledge is connected with defilement that consists in false	1
view, and similarly up to [the seventh relation wherein] the absence of own-being	0
knowledge is connected with [defilement that consists in the continuance of the new	0
existence. What is the reason that [the object of emptiness knowledge etc.] is not	1
caused [to be empty etc.]? Because these dharmas are emptiness etc. by their very	1
nature for the dharmadhātu is undefiled by nature. In this respect, false views are not	1
caused to be empty through emptiness knowledge, because, by their very nature they	1
are characterized by emptiness. The sign of passion etc. is not caused to be signless	1
through signless knowledge303 because the dharmadhatu is signless by its very nature.	1
Likewise up to [the seventh category wherein] the continuance of the new existence is	1
not caused to be devoid of own-being through the absence of own-being knowledge	0

for even when the counteragent has not arisen, the imaginary nature is simply non-	0
existent; and since this is the case, then, if one imagines at the dharmadhātu	1
is defiled or is purified, this is an extreme. What is the reason?	0
He says:	1
because there can be no defilement or purity304 on the part of that	0
which, like space, is undefiled by nature. The middle way is for the	1
purpose of avoiding this extreme, i.e. that which does not cause the	1
dharmas, which are the objects of emptiness knowledge etc.305 and which consist in	0
the perfected nature, to be empty 306, i.e. as devoid of false view etc. which belongs	1
to the other-dependent nature and is adverse to it307 [i.e. the perfected nature] through	1
emptiness in the nature of knowledge 308. On the contrary, the dharmas are	1
already empty of the essential nature of false view which belongs to the imaginary	1
nature, even when knowledge has not arisen. Similarly, [the middle way] does not	1
cause the dharmas to be signless through [the knowledge of] signlessness, [rather] the	1
dharmas are already signless, and so on up to [the seventh category in relation to which	1
the middle way] does not cause the dharmas to be devoid of own-being through [the	1
knowledge of their absence of own-being, [rather] the dharmas are already devoid of	1
"own-being. ""A perspective such as this, O Kāśyapa, is described as an investigation"	1
"of the reality of the dharmas.""309 In this way, both the existence of knowledge and the"	1
existence of what is adverse to it are revealed310 as being devoid of the imaginary	1
nature; thus, the repudiation of the extremes that consist in imposition and negation is	1
complete.	1
[10] The above [represents] the classification of conceptual differentiation in sequen-	1
tial order; in addition to these there are seven kinds of dual extremes that	1
consist in conceptual differentiation. In order to demonstrate [this] classifica.	1
tion of conceptual differentiation, he says: for example, the conceptual differ-	1
entiation in regard to an existent entity is one extreme and the	1
conceptual differentiation in regard to a non-existent entity is another	1
extreme. How so? Hence he says: these are due to imagining that: (a)	1
emptiness is for the destruction of the belief in the existence of the	0
personal entity, or else, (b) insubstantiality is non-existent. If	1
[knowledge] does not cause the dharmas to be empty through emptiness [knowledge]	0
because they are empty by nature, then in that case, emptiness is for the destruction of	1

that [notion] that the personal entity exists, or else [the notion that) insubstantiality does	0
not exist because of the non-existence of the personal entity; for, without an adverse	1
element, there is no counteragent. Therefore, it is to be accepted necessarily that the	1
personal entity exists or, that insubstantiality does not³11. Conceptual differentiation in	1
regard to the existence312 and non-existence of these two is an extreme. The middle	1
way is for the purpose of avoiding these dual extremes that consist in	1
conceptual differentiation in regard to existence and non-existence.	1
"""Emptiness, O Kāśyapa, is certainly not for the destruction of the"	1
"personal entity, moreover, emptiness itself is empty etc."" - thus is the"	1
quotation from the Sūtra³13. In this respect, emptiness is neither for the destruction of	1
the defiled personal entity, nor for the production of a purified314 personal entity for	1
there can be no destruction nor production of the personal entity because it exists just	1
as a designation, like an 'army' etc. Moreover, emptiness itself is empty but it is not	1
[empty] of the personal entity that is imputed through the false view of individuality	1
because the latter is absolutely non-existent. After considering it in this way, the	1
emptiness of the personal entity and the dharmas by way of substantiality is not an ens	1
because it is devoid of the latter; nor is it a non-ens since it consists in the perfected	1
[nature]315. Moreover, in order to illustrate that emptiness does consist in the perfected	1
[nature], he says: the same holds for past emptiness, future emptiness and	1
the emptiness of the present316 because it illustrates the fact that [emptiness]	1
exists as such in all the three times; alternatively, it is because it illustrates the fact that	1
[emptiness] exists as such in the states of the ordinary person, the adept and the one	1
still in training. Of these, the [emptiness of the] past refers to the state of the ordinary	1
person; future [emptiness] refers to the state of the adept; and the [emptiness of the]	1
present refers to the state of the one still in training. And since the emptiness of own-	1
"being of existent and non-existent entities is thus, it is therefore said that: ""you should"	0
"rely on emptiness, O Kāśyapa""³17, because it is the object of direct intuition free from"	1
"conceptual differentiation, ""...do not [rely on] the personal entity318"", because it is just a"	1
verbal expression.	1
[11] Conceptual differentiation in regard to the object of appeasement is	1
an extreme and in regard to the [act of] appeasing; the fact that conceptual	1

differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme has to be understood 319. How	0
so? Hence he says: these are on account of imaginative constructions in	1
regard to the object of relinquishment and the [act of] relinquishing	1
which are due to the fear of emptiness. Of these, the object of appeasement is	1
[equivalent to] the object of relinquishment; the [act of] appeasing is [equivalent to] the	1
[act of] relinquishing. After imagining the dharmas to be [equivalent to] objects of	1
relinquishment and [the knowledge of] emptiness to be [equivalent to] the relinquish-	1
ing 320, fear is generated in regard to emptiness; for, how can the three kinds of defile-	1
ment be objects of relinquishment if they are empty by nature? Hence, they, like the	1
personal entity, ought not be objects of relinquishment and consequently, since there	1
can be no relinquishing in the absence of the object of relinquishment, fear is generated	1
in regard to emptiness this is certainly an extreme. What is the reason? Because	0
[people] are notionally attached to the fact that the dharmas of form and sensation etc.	1
exist substantially in exactly that way in which they are transformed 321 in the nature of	1
consciousness. They fear³22 emptiness due to ignorance³23 of the fact that those	1
[dharmas] of form etc. whose essential nature is imaginary, are, by their very nature,	1
non-existent like the self. Therefore, the example of 'space' is for the purpose	1
of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentia-	1
tion. For instance:	1
"""[Just as] a certain person who is afraid of space324 may beat his chest and"	1
"cry out saying: ""remove this space!"" What do you think, Kãśyapa, would he be"	1
"able to remove the space?"" (Kāśyapa] replies: ""Certainly not, O Venerable"	1
"One."" The Venerable One continues: ""Similarly, Kaśyapa³25, I would say that"	1
those śramanas and brahmans who are fearful in regard to emptiness have met	1
with a severe distraction; and for what reason? Because, O Kaśyapa, they go	1
"astray in regard to emptiness itself and are consequently fearful of it"".326"	1
This is what is being said: just as one is unable to remove space because it consists in	1
all form, similarly, emptiness cannot be removed since it is established in all dharmas at	1
all times, and emptiness cannot be removed from the state of being established through	1

the non-relinquishment of dharmas327, nor can emptiness be established through the	0
relinquishment of dharmas and he consequently shows that this is a groundless fear.	1
[12] Conceptual differentiation328 in regard to the object of fear is an	1
extreme and in regard to the dread of that object of fear; it is the fact that	1
conceptual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred to.	1
That, from which fear arises, is described as the object of fear; insofar as one becomes	1
fearful of this, there is dread, i.e. an undesirable result of that [original fear]. That	1
which one imaginatively construes in regard to both the object of fear and the dread [of	1
the latter] are the extremes329. How so? Hence he says: these result from fear of	1
imaginary forms etc. and are on account of the dread of suffering. For,	1
naive people, after imagining forms etc. which have an imaginary nature330 as being	1
substantial, then imagine the fear from these [forms etc.] and their undesired result.	1
Consequently, on account of their dread of suffering, they become fearful both of their	1
forms etc. and their signs. The example of the 'painter' is for the purpose of	1
avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
For instance:	1
"""[Just as] a painter, O Kāśyapa, after creating the terrifying figure of a"	1
yakşa331 by himself is rendered unconscious after collapsing and falling face-	1
first in abject terror332 of it; similarly, O Kaśyapa, al1333 ordinary naive people,	1
after creating forms, sounds, odours, tastes and tangible things by themselves.	0
wander in samsāra because of those [forms etc.] and fail to understand those	0
"dharmas as they are in reality"" 334"	1
Moreover, just as the painter, having, through false conceptual differentiation, super-	1
imposed the existence of a real yakṣa upon the terrifying figure of the yakşa that he	1
himself has created, and fearing it, is rendered unconscious, similarly, all ordinary	1
people who are impelled by false conceptual differentiation wander in samsāra on	1
account of their individual conceptual differentiations 335 which are described as their	1
own creations and are in a momentary state because they are not established in homo-	1
geneous groups. The former example is in relation to the śrävaka but the	1

latter is [in relation to] the bodhisattva. Some believe that the śrävaka is	0
afraid of emptiness because he has not gained mastery over emptiness; however, the	1
bodhisattva is defiled by conceptual differentiation in regard to the imaginary dharmas	1
because moral defilement consists in conceptual differentiation. Others believe there is	1
no meaningful distinction between the two, nevertheless, they are verbally expressed as	1
a pair on account of the influence of the two categories. Others again believe that due	1
to his fear of emptiness, the śrävaka fails to understand what is to be understood336;	1
although the bodhisattva's [failure to understand] is due to his fear of the dharmas that	1
are conceptually differentiated. Others believe that the former [example acts] as the	1
counteragent to the [tendency to] cling to the self, whereas the latter [acts] as the	1
counteragent to the [tendency to] cling to the dharmas.	1
[13] Conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is an	1
extreme and in regard to the apprehending subject; it is the fact that concep-	1
tual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred to. How	1
can these apprehended objects of form etc. and their apprehending subjects, i.e. the	1
groups of consciousness which are perceived in terms of individual characteristic and	1
result, have the nature of superimposition337 like the self etc.? It is the imaginative	1
construction of apprehended object and apprehending subject as substantial entities that	1
is intended as an extreme. The example of the 'magician' is for the purpose	0
of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentia-	1
tion. For instance:	1
"""[Just as], O Kāśyapa, a magician conjures up a magical creation, then that"	1
which is created by means of the magical show338 may devour the magician	1
himself; similarly, O Käsyapa, when a bhikṣu who practises spiritual discipline	1
(yogācāra) is mentally attentive339 to any particular objective support³40,	1
"everything appears as just a void for him etc"".341"	0
How does one thereby avoid342 the two kinds of extreme that consist in the conceptual	1
differentiation of this kind? Hence he says: for, the knowledge of the non-	1
existence of the object is caused by the knowledge of representation-	1
only and that knowledge of the non-existence of the object annuls that	1
very knowledge of representation-only, because if the object is non-	1
existent, its representation343 is not possible; thus these [two] are	1

similar in this respect. The knowledge of representation-only functions as the	0
magician [in the example]; the knowledge of the non-existence of the object functions	1
as the yakşa that is conjured up, for, the knowledge of the non-existence of the object	1
is characterized by the knowledge that it is representation-only. In the same way that	1
[the yakşa] which is conjured up may devour its creator, similarly, the knowledge of	1
the non-existence of the object will 'devour' that very knowledge of the latter as repre-	1
sentation-only, considering that the perception of the object is a representation,	1
because, if the object does not exist, that it is representation-only is not possible.	1
[14] Conceptual differentiation in regard to correctness is an extreme	1
and in regard to falsity; it is the fact that conceptual differentiation [in regard to	1
the latter] is another extreme that is referred to. In the state that is conducive to pene-	1
tration, both of these conceptually differentiate the investigation of what	1
is real as being dual extremes, i.e. as correct or false. How so? Correctness	1
refers to the dharmas that are without impurity; falsity refers to those that are accompa-	1
nied by impurity. In this respect, if one attaches to the investigation of what is real just	1
in terms of correctness, then it is [only an investigation of the wholesome dharmas	1
that are accompanied by impurity and it would not constitute an investigation of what is	1
real. Again, if [the investigation of what is real is thought to be] characterized by	1
incorrectness, then it is only falsity that is produced like the wholesome [dharmas] that	1
are associated with the three realms of existence344. The example of 'fire coming	1
from two sticks' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes. For	1
instance:	0
"""[Just as], O Käsyapa, a fire is generated in dependence upon two sticks and"	1
that very [fire] being generated 345 consumes those two sticks, similarly, O	1
Kāśyapa, the noble faculty of wisdom is generated in dependence upon the	1
investigation of what is real and when it has been generated, it consumes that	1
"very investigation of what is real"".346"	1
This is what is meant here: just as fire is generated from two sticks which	1
are devoid of the characteristic of fire and [the fire] that is generated	1
consumes the same two sticks, similarly, the noble faculty of wisdom,	0
which has the characteristic of correctness, is generated from the inves-	1
tigation of what is real347 which is devoid of the characteristic of	1
correctness348, and [the faculty of wisdom] that is generated annihilates	1

"what is real thus is the meaning. The latter is described as ""consumed"" it being as"	1
if consumed due to precisely the destruction because one observes that it is modified.	1
And even if this investigation of what is real is 350 accompanied by impurity, it is	1
described as the investigation of what is real because it is in conformity with	1
correctness.	1
[15] Conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action is	1
an extreme and in regard to the non-performance of action; it is the fact	1
that conceptual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred	1
to. How so? Hence he says: both imagine direct intuition to involve an act	1
that is preceded by intelligence, or else, as being devoid of efficacy.	1
"Having considered: “I will relinquish nescience"" if this direct intuition³51"	1
engages in	0
activity for the sake of the relinquishment of that [nescience], this is the extreme that	0
consists in conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action. The	1
notion that, because of its momentary nature, the existence of direct intuition is not	1
possible at the time of the performance of action that leads to relinquishment and	1
consequently is not able to relinquish nescience, is the extreme that consists in	1
conceptual differentiation in regard to the non-performance of action. The example	1
of the oil-lamp' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that	1
consist in conceptual differentiation. For instance:	1
"""[Just as], O Kaśyapa, when an oil-lamp is lit, pitch-darkness vanishes and"	1
"by no means, O Kaśyapa, does the oil-lamp have this thought: ""I can disperse"	1
"all pitch-darkness""; on the contrary, pitch-darkness vanishes in dependence"	1
upon the oil-lamp. Similarly, O Kaśyapa, when direct intuition arises,	1
nescience vanishes and by no means, O Käsyapa, does direct intuition have this	1
"thought: ""I can disperse nescience"". On the contrary, nescience vanishes in"	1
"dependence upon direct intuition"".352"	1
This is what being said: in the same way that, although a lamp is empty of the	1

And similarly, because of the absence of the efficacy of the performance of action on	1
the part of direct intuition³55, it dispels adverse elements356 through its mere presence,	1
like the lamp.	1
[16] Conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination is an	1
extreme and in regard to simultaneity; the fact that conceptual differentiation [in	1
regard to the latter] is another extreme is understood. How so? Hence he says: if one	1
imagines that the counteragent does not arise...; the extreme that consists in	1
conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination refers to the notion that insofar	1
as the counteragent has not arisen for a period of time in the past, so too will it not arise	1
in the present.	1
Or else, [one imagines] defilement to endure for a long	1
time; i.e. if nescience is only established as the counter correlate to direct intuition,	1
direct intuition does not have the capacity to arise and if it is produced in some way,	1
even so, the removal of nescience is unable to be carried out by means of direct	1
intuition whose nature is momentary because [nescience] has developed over a long	1
period of time, and consequently, there would be simultaneity on the part of defilement	1
and purification. The second example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the purpose	1
of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differen-	1
tiation. For instance:	1
"""[Just as], O Kāśyapa, there is an oil-lamp in a house, an abode, or a"	1
cottage 357 which has not been lit by anyone for over a thousand years, then if	1
some person were to light that oil-lamp - what do you think, O Kaśyapa, would	1
"the pitch-darkness have this thought: ""I have accumulated for a thousand years"	1
"and I shall not depart from here""?"" [Kaśyapa] replied: ""Indeed not, O Vener-"	1
able One, for when the oil-lamp is lit, pitch-darkness does not have the power	1
"not to depart - it must necessarily depart from there."" The Venerable One then"	1
"said: ""Similarly, O Kāśyapa, although karma and moral defilement have"	1
accumulated for hundreds of thousands of aeons, they vanish in an instant on	1
account of an investigation facilitated by proper mental attention ³58. As to the	1
oil-lamp, O Kāśyapa, it is an epithet for the noble faculty of wisdom; the pitch-	1
"darkness, O Kāśyapa³59, is an epithet for karma and moral defilement."" ""360"	1
By means of this simile [the Buddha] refutes [the notions that]: (a) the counteragent	1
does not arise on the grounds that its arising is dependent upon conditions and (b) the	1

Which are the specific and non-specific spiritual practices?	1
V.27 ab	1
The specific and non-specific are to	1
be known in relation to the ten	1
spiritual levels;	1
That perfection which predominates on a particular spiritual level is	0
specific to that [level]. When [the bodhisattva] becomes fully accom-	1
plished in every respect in regard to all [the perfections], it is	1
[described as] non-specific.	1
The supremacy in relation to spiritual practice has now been	1
described.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y251.4 [1] The specific and non-specific spiritual practices were listed immediately after the	1
spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes. Hence, immediately	1
following the explanation of the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two	1
extremes, he asks: which	1
are the specific and non-specific spiritual	1
practices? Hence he says:	1
V.27 ab	0
The specific and non-specific are to	1
be known in relation to the ten	1
spiritual levels;	1
In relation to each of the ten spiritual levels361 there are two modes of spiritual practice.	0
How so? Hence he says: that perfection which predominates on a particular	1
spiritual level etc. A bodhisattva established on a particular bodhisattva level	1
applies himself strenuously to a particular perfection; the latter predominates in com-	1
parison with the other perfections on that bodhisattva level and is described as	1
specific. For example, on the first spiritual level the perfection of generosity pre-	1
Y inserts: tāsu daśasu bhūmişv ekaikaśo, on the basis of the Tib.: sa bcu po de dag re re la	0
(D313b.5), which is not found in the Ms.342	1
"dominates and thus the spiritual practice in regard to it is described as ""specific"". The"	0
same applies [to the other spiritual levels], up until the perfection of direct intuition on	1
the tenth [level]. When [the bodhisattva] becomes fully accomplished in	1
regard to all the remaining perfections on each of the spiritual levels362, without	1
distinction, the spiritual practice on these [levels] is described as non-specific; as has	1
"been stated: ""on the joyous level [i.e. the first level] the perfection of generosity"	1
"predominates..."". And nor does [the bodhisattva] not become fully accomplished in"	1
regard to the other [perfections] according to his power and capacity 363. The explana-	1
tions concerning the remaining spiritual levels should similarly be known in accor-	1
dance with the Sutras.	0

3. Supremacy of Objective Support.	1
Which are the supremacies of objective support?	1
V.27 cd & 28 abcd	1
These are considered to consist in:	1
(a) the establishment, (b) the	1
[dharma]dhātu, (c) the probandum,	1
(d) the probans, (e) retention, (f)	1
correct determination, (g) preserva-	0
tion, (h) penetration, (i) diffusion,	1
(j) understanding, (k) meditative	1
calm and (1) the culminating objec-	0
tive support.	1
There are twelve kinds of objective support, namely, (a) the objec-	1
tive support for establishing the designations of the dharmas; (b) the	1
dharmadhatu as objective support; (c) the probandum as objective	1
support; (d) the probans as objective support; (e) the objective support	1
for retention; (f) the objective support for correct determination; (g) the	1
objective support for preservation; (h) the objective support for pene-	1
tration; (i) the objective support for diffusion; (j) the objective support	1
for understanding; (k) the objective support for meditative calm and (1)	1
the culminating objective support. Of these, the first refers to those	1
dharmas that are respectively determined as the perfections etc. The	1
second refers to thusness. The third and fourth refer respectively to	1
[the latter] two again because [the bodhisattva] arrives at an under-	1
standing of the dharmas, such as the perfections, through his penetra-	1
tion of the dharmadhātu. The fifth is the objective support for the	1
knowledge that consists in learning. The sixth [is the objective support	1
for the knowledge that] consists in reflection since [the bodhisattva]	1
retains it after having understood it. The seventh [is the objective	1
support for the knowledge that] consists in meditative development due	1
to its retention [by each bodhisattva), individually. The eighth is [the	1
objective support] on the first spiritual level for the path of vision. The	1
ninth is [the objective support] for the path of meditative development,	1
up until the seventh spiritual level. The tenth is [the objective support]	1
for the mundane and supramundane paths on that same [level] because	1
[the bodhisattva) arrives at the understanding of the Dharma in itsY252.2	0
various modes 364. The eleventh is [the objective support] on the eighth	0
spiritual level. The twelfth is [the objective support] on the three spiri-	1
tual levels beginning with the ninth. And those [original] first and	1
second [objective supports] receive nominal designations as the respec-	1
tive objective supports pertinent to each state.	1
The objective supports have now been described.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
[1] Since this is the appropriate place for an explanation of supremacy in relation to the	1
objective support365, he says: which are the supremacies of objective	1
support?³66 Hence, in order to define these³67, he says:	1
V.27 a	1
[They are considered to consist in]:	0
(a) the establishment, (b) the	1
[dharma}dhātu etc.	0
There are twelve kinds of objective support, beginning with the objective	1
support for establishing, up until the culminating objective support.	1
These are described as the supremacies in relation to the objective supports 368 because	1
they are pre-eminent in comparison with all the other objective supports; it is just the	1
highest that is supreme and this refers to something unequalled and extraordinary 369,	0
Of these, the first refers to those dharmas which are [respectively	0
determined] as the perfections etc.; and since these are respectively deter-	1
mined by the Buddhas and bodhisattvas for the purpose of helping sentient beings,	1
"they are [equivalent to] the term ""establishment"". In order to demonstrate just this, the"	0
author of the commentary says: the objective support for establishing the	1
designations of the dharmas. The designations of the dharmas refers to the	0
designations of the dharmas, such as the perfection of generosity, the factors that	1
contribute to enlightenment and the noble truths etc., i.e. [the dharmas] are established	1
by such [a designation]370; or else, that [i.e. the designation] is [equivalent to the	1
establishment in this regard thus is the establishment of the designations of the	1
dharmas. And in the following 371, the successive order of the objective supports,	1

beginning with the establishment, shall be shown because [this order] is in conformity	0
with one's direct realization. The second refers to thusness because it is	1
synonymous with 'dharmadhātu'. The third and fourth...; of these, the third refers	1
to the probandum as objective support and the fourth, the probans as objective support;	1
refer to the latter two, i.e. the first and the second, respectively. The first refers	0
to the probandum as objective support and the second refers to the probans	1
as objective support. He provides the reason in regard to this: since [the	1
bodhisattva] arrives at an understanding of the dharmas, such as the	1
perfections, through his penetration of the dharmadhātu. What is meant	1
is372: they arrive at an understanding of the perfections which are devoid of impurity	1
due to their penetration of the dharmadhātu³73, i.e. firstly, they have the probandum as	1
objective support, and secondly, the probans as objective support. The fifth, the	1
objective support for retention, is for the knowledge that consists in	1
learning 374. The knowledge that consists in learning is described as retention	1
because it holds fast to the dharmas such as the perfections and to the dharmadhātu,	1
"upon hearing it [for the first time]. The term: ""the objective support for retention"""	1
(dhāraṇālambanam) is [resolved as]: the objective support that leads to retention	1
(dhāraṇāyā ālambanam); furthermore, it refers to the first and second [objective	1
supports], i.e. (a) the objective support for establishment and (b) the dharmadhātu as	1
objective support. The sixth [is the objective support for knowledge that]	1
consists in reflection because [the bodhisattva] retains it after having	1
understood it. [The bodhisattva) arrives at an understanding by means of [the four	1
kinds of reasoning, i.e. (a) dependence, (b) cause and effect, (c) proof of logical	1
possibility and (d) real nature, due to his retention of the meaning of what is learnt.	1
Correct determination refers to the knowledge that consists in reflection; its objective	1
support is the objective support for correct determination. The seventh is	1
that [of the knowledge] that consists in meditative development; that it is	1
the objective support for the latter is understood. Due to its retention [by each	0
bodhisattva], individually - preservation is due to retention of the meaning [by	1
each bodhisattva], individually. The knowledge that consists in meditative develop-	1
ment is applicable to the entry to the first spiritual level. Furthermore, this relates to the	1
applications of mindfulness, up until the powers, and its objective support is the	1
objective support for preservation. The eighth is [the objective	1
support] for the path of vision on the first spiritual level. This refers to	1
the penetration of the all-pervading nature of the dharmadhātu which is without duality	1

chrutamayasya jñānasya but Bhāṣya: śrutamayajñāna- (N74.9-10).Y254	0
[by the bodhisattvas], individually. Alternatively, penetration refers to the piercing of	0
the resistance of: (a) moral defilements that are to be relinquished by [the path of]	0
vision and (b) undefiled nescience which has the meaning of the all-pervading as its	1
object; moreover, this is the path of vision. Its objective support is the objective	1
support for penetration. The ninth is [the objective support] for the	1
path of meditative development, up until the seventh spiritual level.	1
Diffusion refers to the state of existence of the most excellent culminating point and is	1
due to the practice of that same penetration of the dharmadhātu. It consists in the path	1
of meditative development, up until the seventh spiritual level. The objective support	1
for that path of meditative development is [equivalent to the objective support for	1
diffusion. The tenth is that for the mundane and supramundane paths	1
on that same [level] that it is the objective support for the latter is understood;	0
since [the bodhisattva] arrives at the understanding of the Dharma in its	1
"various modes. It is an ""understanding"" (pragama) since, on that same spiritual"	1
level, he attains the understanding (adhigama) of the Dharma in its various modes	1
(prakāra)375 by virtue of his freedom from the notional attachment to all376 the modes	1
etc. of the signs of the Dharma such as the Sūtras. The latter is described as the path of	1
meditative development on that same seventh spiritual level. The objective support that	1
pertains to understanding is the objective support for understanding. The	1
eleventh is [the objective support] on the eighth spiritual level; since, on	1
the eighth level, the meditative calm flows377 spontaneously on the part of [the	1
bodhisattva] whose mental attention is devoid of all signs and effort, that same path of	1
meditative development is described as meditative calm378. The objective support that	1
pertains to meditative calm is the objective support for meditative calm. The	1
twelfth is [the objective support] on the three spiritual levels beginning	1
with the ninth, because, on the ninth, he attains the culminating point of direct intu-	1
ition that consists in the analytical knowledges, on the tenth he attains the culminating	1
point of mastery over karma and on the Buddha level he attains the culminating point	1
of the purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable, in	1
its entirety. In this way, because he reaches the culminating point of the purification of	1
both direct intuition and karma on the three spiritual levels beginning with the ninth, the	1
objective support of one who is established on those levels is described as the culmi-	1
nating objective support. However, others believe that the culminating objective	1
support is mentioned in regard to the three spiritual levels 379, after considering the	1
differentiation of the culminating point of the path as weak, middling and strong. And	1

those [original] first and second [objective supports] receive nominal	0
designations as the respective objective supports380 pertinent to each	1
state so extensive are the objective supports, namely381, the objective support for the	1
establishment of the dharmas and the dharmadhātu as objective support. In this	1
respect382, these two objective supports receive particular nominal designations in	1
relation to each state of direct intuition, (for example], the objective support for reten-	1
tion exists in the state of the knowledge that consists in learning because what is learnt	1
is the object of direct intuition consisting in retention, therefore383, retention knowledge	1
is described as retention. The same should be stated [for the other seven objective	1
supports] up until the culminating objective support. On the ninth, tenth and Buddha	1
levels, there is the culminating attainment, i.e. supramundane direct intuition and the	1
mundane [direct intuition] attained subsequently to that. Thus, the objective support	1
pertinent to this is the culminating objective support.	1

4. Supremacy of Full Attainment.	1
Which are the full attainments?	1
V.29 abcdef	1
Those which consist in: (a) non-	1
defect, (b) non-rejection, (c) non-	1
distraction, (d) fulfilment, (e) gener-	1
ation, (f) development, (g) pliability,	1
(h) non-fixation, (i) non-obscuration	1
and (j) the full attainment of the	0
latter without interruption.	1
These are the ten kinds of full attainment. Of these, (a) the absence	1
of defects in causal conditions refers to full attainment in relation to the	1
spiritual lineage. (b) The non-rejection of the universal vehicle refers	1
to full attainment in relation to firm conviction. (c) The absence of	1
distraction away to the lesser vehicle refers to full attainment in relation	1
to the generation of the resolve [for enlightenment]. (d) The fulfilment	1
of the perfections refers to full attainment in relation to spiritual prac-	1
tice. (e) The generation of the noble path refers to full attainment in	1
relation to the entry into certainty. (f) The development of the roots of	1
the wholesome refers to full attainment in relation to the maturation of	1
sentient beings due to the prolonged exercise. (g) The pliability of	1
mind refers to full attainment in relation to the purification of the field.	1
(h) Non-fixation in samsāra or nirvana refers to full attainment in rela-	1
tion to the acquisition of the prophesies at the irreversible level because	0
[the bodhisattva] does not turn away from samsära or nirvana. (i) The	1
absence of obscuration refers to full attainment in relation to the	1
Buddha-level. (j) The non-interruption of the latter refers to full	1
attainment in relation to the complete exposition of enlightenment.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y255.2 [1] Now, in order to correctly determine the supremacy in relation to full attainment	1
whose appropriate place [for exposition] has arrived, he says: which are the full	0
attainments? They are full attainments insofar as they are brought about through	1
particular spiritual practices. They are described as supreme because: (a) they are super-	1
ior to other full attainments and (b) there are no other full attainments that are superior	1
to them. In order to demonstrate them, he says:Y256	1
Those which consist in: (a) non-	0
defect, (b) non-rejection³84, (c) non-	1
distraction, (d) fulfilment etc.	1
ment.	0
Therein, there are ten kinds of full attainment, beginning with the absence of	1
defects in causal conditions and concluding with the complete exposition of enlighten-	1
Of these, the absence of defects in causal conditions refers to full	0
attainment in relation to the spiritual lineage. The absence of defects in	1
causal conditions [means that] each of them is present; when these are secured [the	0
bodhisattva] attains the spiritual lineage in full what is meant is: the latter [i.e. the	1
spiritual lineage] becomes abundant and ever more excellent. Moreover, [these condi-	1
tions] refer to the mixing with good men, listening to the True Dharma and proper	1
mental attention etc. A defect in these is due to defects in relation to the spiritual	1
lineage and friends etc.385	1
V.29 ab	1
[2] The non-rejection of the universal vehicle refers to full attainment in	1
relation to firm conviction. If one does not reject the Dharma of the universal	1
vehicle which is characterized by profundity and magnanimity then the growth of firm	1
conviction which has the nature of the maintenance of [the bodhisattva's] determina-	1
tion, ensues.	1
[3] The absence of distraction away to the lesser vehicle refers to full	1
attainment in relation to the generation of the resolve [for enlighten-	1
ment]. Although the conditions may exist for a reversal of the resolve for enlighten-	1
ment on the part of one whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated, if³86 his	1
resolve does not stray to the śrävaka vehicle or to the pratyekabuddha vehicle, then his	1
resolve for enlightenment reaches maturity.	1
[4] The fulfilment of the perfections refers to full attainment in relation	1
to spiritual practice. On account of the fulfilment of the perfection of generosity	1
etc. there is growth in the accomplishment of omniscience on the part of those whose	1
resolve for enlightenment has been generated due to the force of the latter [i.e.	1
bodhicitta].	1

Something faulty or in decay is described as 'raw' (ama) - where this is non-existent, it	1
is certain [lit. 'free from defect'] (nyāma), like a place sheltered from the wind389, i.e. a	1
region free from impurity. [The term]: 'entry into certainty' (nyāmävakrānti) is	1
[resolved as] entry into certainty (nyāmāyām avakrānti); what is meant is: the latter	1
[i.e. avakrānti, lit. 'descent'] is [equivalent to] 'entry' (praveśa)390. Also, as regards the	1
reading: 'entry into certainty' (niyamāvakrānti), the word 'certitude' (niyama) is none	1
other than certainty (niyama), for thus it is said that one for whom the path of vision	1
has arisen is certain [to be born] in a propitious state of existence or nirvana.	1
[6] The development of the roots of the wholesome refers to full attain-	1
ment in relation to the maturation of sentient beings due to the	1
prolonged exercise. The development of the roots of the wholesome refers to the	1
growth of the roots of the wholesome in those who have attained the path of vision due	1
to prolonged exercise or practice on the path of meditative development which is	1
attained subsequently to that [path of vision]. Since [the bodhisattva] has the ability to	1
bring beings to maturity on account of that [growth], consequently 391, the development	1
of the roots of the wholesome refers to full attainment in relation to the maturation of	1
beings. However, others believe that the maturation of sentient beings by [the	1
bodhisattva] in this way is fully attained because392 the roots of the wholesome are	1
strengthened393 in the mental continuum of sentient beings owing to prolonged practice	1
by him.	0
[7] The pliability of mind 394 refers to full attainment in relation to the	1
purification of the field 395. Since the pliability of mind on the part of those	1
whose roots of the wholesome have increased through meditative development is due	1
to separation from both the signs and the effort that are adverse to the path traversable	1
by just the one [i.e. the Buddha], he shows the Buddha-field [is attained], like crystal	0
etc. according to one's wish, through the influence of pliability 396. Hence, the pliability	0
of mind refers to full attainment in regard to the purification of the field. 397 Although	1
"in a different Sūtra it is said: ""One who wishes the pure Buddha-field should [first]"	1
"purify his own mind""."	1

[8] Non-fixation in samsāra or nirvana refers to full attainment in rela-	1
tion to the acquisition of the prophesies at the irreversible level.	1
so? Hence he says: because [the bodhisattva] does not turn away from	0
samsāra or nirvana, because he is not fixed in samsāra or nirvana on account of	1
his mental pliability. Since he possesses the prosperous result of the three perfections	1
beginning with generosity, he is not fixed in nirvana due to his regard for sentient	1
beings. Since he possesses the three perfections beginning with vigour, he is not	1
defiled by the moral defilements of samsāra; therefore, he is not fixed in samsāra.	1
Alternatively, he is not fixed in samsāra nor nirvāṇa for he does not turn away from	1
either of them. In this respect, he does not turn away from samsāra because of his	1
regard for sentient beings for he accepts samsara out of compassion; nor does he turn	1
away from nirvāṇa on account of his wisdom. Thus, since the bodhisattva is fixed	1
neither in samsāra nor nirvana, he remains on the unshakable level which is irre-	1
versible, and [experiences] full attainment in relation to the acquisition of the prophesy	1
of his Buddha[hood]. Alternatively, [he experiences] full attainment in relation to both	1
the acquisition of the irreversible level and the acquisition of the prophesy.	0
[9] The absence of obscuration refers to full attainment in relation to the	1
Buddha-level398, because [the bodhisattva experiences] full attainment in relation to	1
the Buddha-level, which incorporates the three Bodies, on account of his relinquish-	1
ment of all obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable together	1
with their latent impressions. Therefore, the absence of obscuration refers to full	1
attainment in relation to the Buddha-level.	1
[10] The non-interruption of the latter refers to full attainment in rela-	1
tion to the complete exposition of enlightenment. There is no interruption to	1
that Buddha's enlightenment due to the force of his universal compassion (which	1
endures] for as long as the world exists. Full attainment in relation to the complete	1
exposition of enlightenment is [equivalent to the demonstration of enlightenment. In	1
this regard, [the Buddha's] dwelling in the Tuşita realm, his descent into the womb, his	1
birth, his enjoyment of sense-pleasures, his departure from home, his performance of	1
difficult deeds, his turning of the Great Wheel of the Dharma and his mahäparinirvāṇa	1
etc. are demonstrated, because the complete exposition of enlightenment is not some-	1
"thing separate from these [events]. The expression: ""the complete exposition of enlight-"	1
"enment"", includes [these] additional [events] also, since it is mentioned just as an"	1
example.	1
The Tib. Tika (D316b.6) appears to phrase this passage in verse form:	1
sgrib pa med pa'i sans rgyas kyi //	1
sa yan dag par 'grub pa'o //	1
However, the second line, for metrical reasons, cannot possibly be in verse form and the	0
reading of the Tib. Bhäşya (D26b.4) is preferred: sgrib pa med pa ni sans rgyas kyi sa yan dag	1
par 'grub pa = nirāvaraṇatā buddhabhūmisamudāgama; cf. Blaşya N75.8.	1

The Explanation of the Name of the Treatise.	1
Thus, this is:	1
V.30 a	0
The treatise that consists in the	1
analysis of the middle;	0
V.30 C+	0
Because it elucidates the middle way. This is also the analysis of	1
the middle and the extremes because it elucidates the middle and the two	1
extremes. Alternatively, it [elucidates] the middle which is devoid of	1
beginning and end.	1
V.30 b	1
Its meaning is hidden	1
quintessential;	0
Because it is not the sphere of speculation nor can it be shattered by	0
those who hold other views, respectively.	1
V.30 c-	1
And it has universal meaning;	1
Because it is relevant to both oneself and to others.	0
It incorporates all meaning;	1
Because it is relevant to the three vehicles.	0
V.30 d	0
It removes all ill.	1
Because it brings about the relinquishment of both the obscuration	1
that consists in moral defilement and the knowable.	1
[Sthiramati]	1
Y258.12 [1] Thus, i.e. since the general meanings of the words herein are complete and in	1
order to express or to understand the name [of the treatise] in conformity with these	1
meanings, this is described as:	1
V.30 a	0
treatise that consists in the	1
analysis of the middle;	1
To provide the reason for engagement in the entry herein, he says: because it eluci-	0
dates the middle way; because this treatise herein elucidates the middle way devoid	1
of the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism. Therefore, this treatise is described	1
as the analysis of the middle what is meant is: it is an exposition and illustration of the	1
middle [way]. This is also the analysis of the middle and the extremes;	1
here now he provides the reason: because it elucidates the middle and the two	1
extremes, hence it is described as the analysis of the middle and the extremes. TheY259	1
middle, in this context, refers to the dharmadhatu which is without duality and the	1
extremes refer to imputation and negation. Alternatively, since it elucidates the	1
middle which is devoid of beginning and end, some believe this refers to	1
thusness; others believe that it is the imagination of the unreal which is without begin-	1
ning and end that is elucidated in this context and is referred to by the words 'middle	1
and extremes'.	1
V.30 b	1
meaning is hidden and	0
quintessential;	1
Its meaning is hidden because it is not the sphere of speculation and its	0
meaning is quintessential because it cannot be shattered by those who hold	1
other views, respectively. It is not the sphere of speculation because it is recog-	1
nized as the domain of direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation. meaning	1
is quintessential because it promulgates the meaning [of phenomena] as they are in	1
reality.	1
V.30 c-	1
And it has universal meaning;	1
Because it is relevant to both oneself and to others; because it is relevant to	0
the bodhisattva's way of life, and because that way of life of the bodhisattva causes the	1
attainment of benefit for oneself and others.	1
V.30 +	1
It incorporates all meaning;	1
Because it is relevant to the three vehicles; since it illustrates the path of the	0
śrāvaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.	1
V.30 d	1
It removes all ill.	1
Because it brings about the relinquishment of both the obscuration that	1
consists in moral defilement and the knowable.N76.3	1
The Summary Meaning of the Supremacy of the	1
Vehicle.	1
The summary meaning of supremacy. Summarily, supremacy is	1
threefold: (a) spiritual practice, (b) the foundation of spiritual practice	1
and (c) the result of spiritual practice. Which kind of spiritual practice	1
"is highest and in which way [is that practice performed]? ""Mental"	1
"attention to the Dharma of the universal vehicle, as set forth etc."" [V.7"	0
ab], i.e. how and in which mode does it: (a) become free from distraction	1
through the meditative development of tranquillity and (b) become free	1
from erroneous inversion through the meditative development of pene-	1
trating insight? As to its purpose it is in order to go forth by the	1
middle way.	1
"And it is in relation to what? ""The specific and non-"	1
"specific are [to be known] in relation to the ten spiritual levels"" [V.27"	1
The summary meaning of the [various categories of] absence of	1
erroneous inversion: (a) [the bodhisattva] penetrates the sign of tran-	1
quillity and the sign of direct intuition399 through the absence of	1
erroneous inversion in relation to syllables. (b) He penetrates the sign	1
of erroneous inversion400 through the absence of erroneous inversion in	1
relation to objects. (c) He avoids the underlying cause of erroneous	1
inversion through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to	1
mental activity. (d) He firmly grasps the sign of the latter through the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dispersal.	1
(e) He	1
cultivates the path devoid of conceptual differentiation which [acts] as	1
the counteragent to the latter through the absence of erroneous inver-	1
sion in relation to the individual characteristic. (f) He penetrates that	1
which is pure by nature through the absence of erroneous inversion in	1
relation to the universal characteristic. (g) He understands in full the	1
relinquishment and non-relinquishment of obscuration to the latter	1
through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to impure and	0
pure mental activity. (h) He understands defilement and purification in	1
full, as they are in reality, through the absence of erroneous inversion	1
in relation to their adventitious nature. (i) He sets forth towards the	1

Y259.22 [1] The summary meaning of supremacy; the purpose for expressing the	1
summary meaning has been discussed previously. Summarily, supremacy is	1
threefold, although in detail it is infinite: (a) spiritual practice; he has stated that:	0
"""supremacy is [considered] in relation to: spiritual practice..."" [V.1 a]. (b) The"	1
"foundation of spiritual practice; he has stated that it is considered: ""in relation"	1
"to objective support"" [V.1 b-]. (c) The result of spiritual practice; he has stated"	1
"that: ""it is considered as listed in relation to full attainment"" [V.b+c]."	1
Whatever virtue there is in writing this commentary,	1
May it be for the increase of merit and knowledge	0
for the great universe;	1
As the consequence of this, may the universe enjoy,	0
before long,	1
Great prosperity and the threefold enlightenment.	0
"[2] Which kind of spiritual practice is highest? He has stated: ""the highest"	1
"consists in twelve"" [V.2 d]. And in which way [is that practice performed]?"	1
"""Mental attention to the Dharma of the universal vehicle, according to"	1
its teaching, etc. is perpetual on the part of the bodhisattva, through the three modes	1
"of wisdom"" [V.7 abcd]; and similarly: ""this [spiritual practice] is to be known as being"	1
"associated with the ten acts of the Dharma"" [V.8 cd], i.e. how and in which mode"	1
does it: (a) become free from distraction through the meditative devel-	0
opment of tranquillity due to the absence of the six kinds of distraction, and (b)	1
become free from erroneous inversion through the meditative develop-	0
ment of penetrating insight due to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation	1
to the ten [categories] beginning with syllables? As to its purpose it is in	1
"order to go forth by the middle way; he has stated: ""which is the spiritual"	1
practice which incorporates the avoidance of the two extremes? [cf. Bhãşya N69.19]	1
"And it is in relation to what? ""In relation to the ten spiritual levels"""	1
"[V.27 b]. What is [the spiritual practice]? ""The specific and non-specific"""	1
"[V.27 c]. How so? It was stated: ""...are to be known in relation to the ten spiritual"	1
"leveis"" [V.27 b].Y262"	1
[3] The summary meaning of the [various categories of] absence of	1
erroneous inversion: (a) [the bodhisattva] penetrates 401 the sign of tran-	0
quillity and the sign of direct intuition402 through the absence of	1
erroneous inversion in relation to syllables; i.e. he comes to the realization	1
that a combination [of syllables] is devoid of essential nature. (b) He penetrates	1
the sign of erroneous inversion through the absence of erroneous inver-	1
sion in relation to objects; i.e. [he realizes] that the duality is just an appearance.	1
(c) He avoids the underlying cause of erroneous inversion403; i.e. the 'seed'	1
of the notional attachment to the duality which is deposited in the store-consciousness,	1
through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activ-	1
ity.404	1
(d) He firmly grasps the sign of erroneous inversion owing to the	1
absence of the notional attachment to existent and non-existent [entities] which are like	1
magical creations, through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to	1
non-dispersal. (e) He cultivates the path devoid of conceptual differen-	1
tiation, which has the individual characteristic405 of the dharmas for its object and is	1
free from speech, which [acts] as the counteragent to the latter through the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual character-	1
istic. (f) He penetrates that which is pure by nature, as being common to	0
all dharmas, through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the	1
universal characteristic. (g) He understands in full the relinquishment	0
non-relinquishment 406 of obscuration to the latter through the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to impure and pure mental	1
activity, because the dharmadhatu which is luminous by nature is defiled by adven-	1
titious secondary defilement. (h) He understands defilement and purification	1
in full through the lack of erroneous inversion in relation to their	1
adventitious nature, because it is impossible that defilement and purification can	1
belong to what is luminous by nature, in any other way [i.e. other than as adventitious].	1
(i) He sets forth towards the absence of obscuration407 through the	1
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of	1
arrogance on account of the absence of the notional attachment to the personal entity	1
and the dharmas.	1
401 Read: pratividhyati as per Bhäşya (cf. N76.13 - D27a.2), but Tib.: dmigs pa (D318a.1) which	1
should be changed to rab tu rtogs pa as noted by Y (cf. his fn.5 p.261).	1
vipaśyananimittam is omitted from both the Sanskrit and Tib. Bhaşya but is found in the Tib.	1
Tika: Ihag mthon gi mtshan ma (D318a.1); cf. N's fn.5 p.76.	1
Read: viparyasanidānam in place of viparyāsāśrayam; cf. Bhaşya N76.14. Ms.(85.1) line	1
begins: -tam dvayabhiniveśabijam...	1
The final portion of the Ms. begins here (Y261.11) and continues to the end.	1
Ms.(85.2): dharmalakṣaṇa... but Y's emendation to dharmas valakṣaṇa... is preferred on the basis	1
of the Tib. ran gi mtshan ñid (D318a.3). Ms. line 2 begins: -naprakştim sarvadharma...; cf. Y's	1
fn.7 p.261.	1
Ms.(85.2):...prahīṇāprahīņātām but Y's reading of ...prahīṇāprahīṇatām is preferred.	1

And so is completed this sub-commentary on the Madhyäntavibhāga	1
composed by the Ācārya Sthiramati which follows scriptural	1
tradition; and thus, the essence of the Pancavimśatisāhasrikā	1
Prajñāpāramitā is completed.408	1
A portion of the Ms.(85.3) is missing and the words prajñāpāramita pañca- are inserted after Y's	1
