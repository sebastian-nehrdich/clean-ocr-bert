for Hannah and EllieABSTRACT
This work contains two main components: (a) an English translation of the
Sanskrit texts comprising the Buddhist Yogācāra philosophical work known as the
Madhyāntavibhaga. It includes the verses (kārikā) of Maitreya/Asanga, commentary
(bhāşya) of Vasubandhu and sub-commentary (fika) of Sthiramati. (b) Text critical
remarks for the establishment of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's commentary based
upon: (i) a photographed copy of the original manuscript, (ii) the Edited Sanskrit text
prepared by S. Yamaguchi and (iii) the Peking and Derge (sde dge) editions of the
canonical blockprints of the Tibetan bsTan hgyur.
The Madhyāntavibhāga contains an exposition of the analysis (vibhāga) of the
middle way (madhya) in relation to the various extreme views (anta). It is arranged in
five chapters: The first chapter, "the defining characteristics" (lakšaņa) provides a
detailed account of both the nature of the phenomenal world and the way that it is
imaginatively constructed (parikalpyate) in consciousness, as well as the Yogācāra
understanding of emptiness (śünyata). Chapter two identifies the main obscurations
(avaraṇa) to enlightenment for the śravaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.
Chapter three provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva) and their intrinsic
relationship with the three natures (svabhāva), i.e the imaginary (parikalpita), the other-
dependent (paratantra) and the perfected (parinişpanna). Chapter four is concerned
with the development of meditative practices (bhāvanā), the various states (avasthā) of
the latter and the results (phala) obtained from those states. Chapter Five extols the
virtues of the universal vehicle (mahāyāna) in comparison to the other vehicles
especially in regard to spiritual practice (pratipatti), objective support (ālambana) and
full attainment (samudāgama).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the people who, in various ways,
made this study possible. Firstly, I wish to thank Professor J. W. de Jong for his
guidance both during my early years as a student of the Sanskrit language and literature
and in the preparation of this work. Without the benefit of his scholarly expertise and
learning the completed work would certainly have been of a much lower standard. I
must also thank my co-supervisor, Dr. Tissa Rajapatirana, whose infinite patience and
skills as a teacher of the Sanskrit and Tibetan languages made it possible for me to
embark upon this project. This work has also benefitted immensely from his
corrections and suggested changes made after reading through the entire work in its
final stages.
I am also in debt to my friend Dr. Michael Comans with whom, as a fellow Ph.D.
student at the A.N.U., I had the good fortune to share an office for three years.
Michael's discipline and dedication to his task is an inspiration to all who work with
him. To Peter Oldmeadow, a true kalyāṇamitra and fellow Ph.D. student, I owe much
for having sparked my initial interest in Indian Religions especially in regard to the
theory and practice of Buddhism. The value of our discussions on the subject over the
years has been immense.
Thanks are also due to the other members of the South and West Asia Centre: Dr.
Luise Hercus, Dr. Richard Barz and Mr. Yogendra Yadav for their friendship and
help. Special thanks are due to the Secretary of the Centre Miss Betty Kat whose good
humour, abundant energy and willingness to be of assistance have eased the difficulties
on countless occasions.
I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Gadjin M. Nagao who kindly
provided me with photocopies of the actual manuscript of the Tika used by Susumu
Yamaguchi in the preparation of his Sanskrit Edition. Thanks are due to Dr. Johannes
Bronkhorst of the Kern Institute who generously provided advice concerning the
proper interpretation of a Sanskrit grammatical term used by Sthiramati. I must
acknowledge the help of Professor Michael Hahn who first suggested that I enquire of
the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project on the expectation that the original
manuscript of the Madhyāntavibhāga-ṭīkā may have been re-discovered there and 1
must also express my gratitude to Dr. Horst Brinkhaus of the Nepal-German
Manuscript Preservation Project who supervised the copying process and ensured that
the copy was despatched to Australia without undue delay.vi
I am indebted to Professor Monika Theil-Horstmann and Dr. Akira Saito for their
generous assistance in the translation of some articles in the German and Japanese
languages, respectively, which were essential to my research. Thanks are due also to
Mr. Yasuo Tsukada for material support given in the true spirit of dāna.
Finally, I wish to thank the Faculty of Asian Studies for the excellent facilities and
opportunity to carry out this research.Contents

There are three main reasons for this neglect: (a) The MAV- Tīkä stands virtually
alone as a broad ranging account of early Yogãcãra thought; consequently it is often
not possible to seek help from other parallel texts for a proper understanding of some
of its more complex passages. The Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra (MSA) is closely related
to the MAV and a study of Sthiramati's commentary will undoubtedly shed more light
on the MAV; however, the MSA reflects a more practice oriented doctrine and many
of its ideas are generally at an earlier stage of development. There are other shorter
works in existence that obviously share common doctrinal elements with the MAV,
such as the Dharmadharmatavibhāga and Vasubandhu's Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi;
however, these works are relevant only to specific aspects of the early Yogācāra and
The Madhyântavibhāga (MAV) contains a comprehensive and detailed account of
the philosophical thought of the Yogācāra school of Mahāyāna Buddhism at an early
stage of its development. As a systematic exposition of the Mahayana from the
perspective of the early Yogācāra it is unique; thus its understanding is fundamental to
a proper appreciation of Yogācāra thought.
In the Indian Yogacara tradition the MAV comprises three essential works: (a) the
Kārikā text attributed to Maitreya / Asanga, (b) Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya and (c) the Țīkā
of Sthiramati. Considering that all three of these works have been available for more
than fifty years it is remarkable that they have not been comprehensively studied to-
date. The French translation and annotation of the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi by Louis de
La Vallée Poussin in 1928-292 remains the most authoritative study of the Yogācāra-
vijñaptimātra doctrine. However, this work is not representative of the Yogācāra as a
whole but is heavily influenced by Dharmapala's interpretation of the thought of
Maitreya and Vasubandhu and has fundamental differences from Sthiramati's
interpretations as contained in the MAV-Tīka³. Apart from a flurry of scholarly
activity that coincided with the publication of the Sanskrit Editions of Sthiramati's
Tika in the early 1930's and Vasubandhu's Bhaṣya5 in the 1960's, the MAV has
received only piecemeal attention.

are themselves in need of further study. (b) An additional hindrance to the study of
this school lies in the fact that the precise meaning of many of the words and concepts
employed by Sthiramati is often of quite an enigmatic nature. This is due partly to his
terse commentarial style but also because the reader's familiarity with many of the
subjects discussed is assumed and no attempt is made at further clarification. In
addition, when presenting the alternative views held by other schools Sthiramati never
identifies the particular school intended; presumably because this is also assumed to be
common knowledge. (c) The third factor that has had an inhibiting influence on the
study of the MAV is the quality of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's Tīkä edited and
published by S. Yamaguchi. The manuscript used by Yamaguchi was hand-copied
from a badly damaged original, a large portion of which was reconstructed with the
help of the Tibetan translations. Since it is often impossible to recast much more than
the known technical terms from the Tibetan into Sanskrit with any certainty, such an
enterprise is never entirely satisfactory and this edition stands in need of improvement.
It was the French scholar Sylvain Lévi who first discovered the Sanskrit
manuscript of the MAV-Tīka in Nepal in 1928 and arranged to have a copy prepared
by hand. Inevitably scribal errors were incorporated during the copying process. As
mentioned above, the original manuscript was incomplete with approximately one third
of all the folios missing on the left-hand side. The copied manuscript was then
entrusted to Susumu Yamaguchi who prepared a Sanskrit edition, the first two
chapters of which were published over the next couple of years in various issues of
Otani Gakuhō6. Meanwhile, the MAV-Țikã was discovered for a second time in
Nepal by Guiseppe Tucci, who, with the help of Vidhusekhara Bhaṭṭācārya, also
engaged in the preparation of a Sanskrit edition. Although originally intending to edit
and reconstruct the missing portions of the entire text, they eventually published only
the first chapter in 19327. This is a work of good quality (in devanagarī script) and the
reconstructed sentences are sometimes preferable to those of Yamaguchi's edition. In
1934 S. Yamaguchi published an edition of the complete Sanskrit text in five chapters
(in Romanised form) which includes the portions recast from the Tibetan. Although
this edition of the MAV-ȚIka has many shortcomings, it must be regarded as a
significant and valuable scholarly achievement; this edition is used as the basis of the
present study.

The MAV-Bhäşya then became the focus of scholarly attention with the
publication in 1937 of S. Yamaguchi's edition of Vasubandhu's Bhasya which
included the Tibetan translation and the Chinese translations of Hsüan-tsang and
Paramärtha¹3. In 1953-54 P.W. O'Brien published an English translation of the third
chapter of the Bhāṣya in two issues of Monumenta Nipponica¹4. This is a very
thorough and readable work based on the Tibetan and Chinese translations and
includes abundant references to Sthiramati's Tika (Yamaguchi's ed.) and also to the
LVP Kośa and Siddhi. An important contribution to the study of the MAV was made
in 1964 when Gadjin M. Nagao published a Sanskrit (Romanised) edition of
Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya which incorporates the Karikā text¹5. It was epared from a
manuscript discovered in the Ngor Monastery in Tibet by Rahula Sanskrityāyana in
1934 and is an exceptionally fine work requiring only a few minor corrections. The
publication of this edition now made it possible to revise Yamaguchi's edition of the
Tīkä since the latter contains many quotations from the Bhäsya that were reconstructed

A Japanese translation of the MAV-Tika was published by S. Yamaguchi in
193510,
The following year the great Russian scholar of Buddhism Theodore
Stcherbatsky published an English translation of just the first chapter of the MA V-
Tika. This work which includes a translation of Vasubandhu's Bhãşya from the
Tibetan is based on the Tucci and Bhaṭṭācārya edition of the Tika as well as the Tibetan
translation. As far as the translation is concerned, it is not a very useful work since it
suffers both from Stcherbatsky's somewhat florid and free style as well his many
philosophical misconceptions regarding the Yogacara doctrine. However, his text-
critical remarks and annotations where he often provides a more literal translation are
quite valuable; many are difficult to improve upon and are incorporated in the present
study. At the same time that Stcherbatsky was preparing his translation, the Dutch
scholar David Friedmann was also translating the first chapter of the Tikå based on
Yamaguchi's edition. When he discovered that the Russian scholar was translating the
same work, Friedmann almost abandoned his translation but fortunately was persuaded
by Stcherbatsky himself to complete his study¹2. The result is a good translation,
generally superior to that of Stcherbatsky's and well annotated particularly through its
references to the LVP Kośa and Siddhi; however, no attempt has been made to rectify
the Sanskrit textual problems.

An attempt was made to improve upon Yamaguchi's edition of the Tīkā by the
Indian scholar Ramachandra Pandeya who published a revised edition in 197119
incorporating the Bhãşya and Kärikā text. In the introduction to this work Pandeya
claims that his corrections to Yamaguchi's edition are made on the basis of the Tibetan
translation (Peking Ed.). Pandeya's edition was reviewed by J.W. de Jong20 who
demonstrated that in many instances his emendations appear to be made quite
arbitrarily without recourse to the Tibetan text and for this reason Pandeya's edition has
not been consulted in the present study. In his review, de Jong resolves many of the
textual problems of the second chapter of the Țikä.
In 1982 Thomas A. Kochumuttom published a study of the essential doctrines
from the works of Vasubandhu21 which includes an English translation of the first
chapter of the MAV-Bhāṣya as well as selected parts of the Tika. Although his
translation of the Bhãṣya is generally quite accurate, his translation of the Țika
passages (upon which much of his interpretative comment depends) is based on
Pandeya's edition which, as we have seen, is not completely reliable. It should be
noted that Kochumuttom's understanding of the philosophy of Vasubandhu is
controversial for he argues that it is open to interpretation as a system that embraces
"realistic pluralism". An English translation of the whole MAV-Bhāṣya was included
in a publication by Stephan Anacker in 198422. This is an unsatisfactory work which
abounds with errors and misunderstandings 23
When my own project was first conceived it was envisaged to have three main
components: (a) A translation of the Karika, Bhãşya and Tīkā texts based on Nagao's
and Yamaguchi's respective editions. (b) Text-critical annotations to the Yamaguchi
edition of the Tika with the help of the Sanskrit Bhāṣya and versions of the
Tibetan translation, i.e. the Derge (sde dge) and Peking editions, with the aim of
making a significant contribution towards the establishment of a more reliable Sanskrit

Tīkā text. (c) Time permitting, I also hoped to produce a preliminary exegesis of the
work.
Several months after beginning my study I was fortunate enough to discuss my
research with Professor M. Hahn of the Indologisches Seminar of the University of
Bonn who was visiting the A.N.U. at the time. Following his suggestion I contacted
the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project in Kathmandu, Nepal, on the
chance that the original manuscript of the MAV-Tīkā were listed among their records.
As it turned out, this was in fact the case the Tīkä had indeed been discovered for a
third time and was catalogued and microfilmed in 1970 by that organization. Many
months later I managed to secure a copy of the manuscript which was photographed
from the microfilmed copy. The script of the manuscript is clearly a variety of Nevari
and the reproduction is generally of a very high quality, most characters being quite
legible as can be seen from the samples shown in Appendix I. It soon became obvious
that it was the very manuscript found by Lévi and Tucci more than fifty years earlier
although a little worse for wear. When compared with Yamaguchi's edition, the
lacunae coincide almost exactly; the only differences being caused by further
deterioration along the damaged side of some folios where up to ten characters may be
lost. The first folio (1b) is in a particularly bad state with only a small fragment that
can be read with certainty. Also, two folios are completely absent (31b and 32a
equivalent to Y105.15 to 106.27). The microfilm is kept in the National Archives,
Kathmandu, Nepal, and the details found on the title page are as follows: Manuscript
No. 5 233 vi bauddhadarśana 66; Catalogue: brhat samkşipta sūcipatram; Title:
Madhyāntavibhaga-kārikā; No. of leaves: 85; Size: 56 x 5.5 cm.; Date of filming:
22.9.70; Remarks: palm-leaf - half of the foll. very badly damaged; Reel No. A38/10.
The re-discovery of the original manuscript of the MAV-Țīkâ has thus made it
possible to include new material in this study, material that is particularly relevant to the
establishment of the Sanskrit text. By comparing the original manuscript with the
Yamaguchi edition it has been possible to detect and rectify many mis-readings and
scribal errors that were incorporated into the Yamaguchi edition. This aspect of my
work has been further complemented through the acquisition of a photo-copy of the
actual manuscript used by Yamaguchi which was kindly supplied by Prof. G.M.
Nagao.
As my research progressed it became apparent that there would not be time to carry
out the third component originally envisaged, i.e. the exegesis of the text; rather, the
completed study would be restricted to the translation and textual emendations. In
addition to the textual problems encountered in the Sanskrit Tīkā, the Tibetan
translation is also quite corrupt in many places, thus compounding the difficulties in
establishing the Sanskrit. Although I am now reasonably satisfied that the majority of
the textual problems have been resolved, the completed work cannot not be regarded as1.

definitive or conclusive. The MAV-Tīkā will no doubt yield greater coherence to
future scholars and many of its more enigmatic passages will be translated with more
certainty only after the writings of Sthiramati are understood in greater depth. Suffice
it to say that, although there is considerable scope for improvement through future
research, is intended that this study may serve as the basis for a critical edition of the
Sanskrit text of the Tika and that the translation will be of value to those seeking a
proper understanding of the philosophy and doctrine of the early Yogācāra.

V. Bhaṭṭācārya. Calcutta Oriental Series, No.24, 1932.
Synopsis of the Madhyāntavibhāga.
As its title suggests, the central theme of the Madhyāntavibhāga is the analysis
(vibhāga) of the traditional Buddhist concept of the Middle Way (madhya) in relation
to the various extreme views (anta) recast to accomodate the spiritual perspective of the
Yogācāra. The extremes are normally identified as belonging to two essential
categories, i.e. as the extreme views which lead to imputation (samāropa) or negationxviii
(apavāda) in regard to the existence (bhava) of phenomena in contrast to the way that
they are to be understood in reality. The MAV is arranged in five chapters which deal
with seven main subjects: (a) the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa), (b) the obscurations
(āvaraṇa), (c) the realities (tattva), (d) the meditative development of counteragents
(pratipakṣa-bhāvanā), (e) the various states (avasthā) in the latter, (f) the attainment of
results (phala-präpti) and (g) the supremacy of the [universal] vehicle (yānānuttarya).
Each chapter concludes with an abridged summary (piņdārtha) of contents which,
according to Sthiramati24, is included to enable the student to easily remember both the
contents and sequential order of the subjects explained.
The first chapter, which is possibly the most complex of the five, provides a
detailed account of the essential philosophy of this school. The chapter is divided into
two parts: the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of: (a) the imagination of what is unreal
(abhūta-parikalpa) and (b) emptiness (śūnyatā). Part (a) explores both the nature of the
phenomenal world which is understood in essence as unreal (abhūta), and the way in
which it comes into being or is imaginatively constructed (parikalpa). This part is
divided into nine sections which include explanations of the three natures (tri-
svabhāva), the dynamics of the actualizing consciousnesses (pravṛtti-vijñānāni) and an
extremely detailed re-interpretation of the theory of dependent origination (pratitya-
samutpāda) according to this school. Part (b) defines the correct understanding of
emptiness (śūnyată) in the context of Yogacara thought. This includes a sixteenfold
differentiation of emptiness and contains some of the more enigmatic portions of the
text particularly where emptiness is described as having some sort of positive
ontological value, i.e. the characteristic of emptiness is defined as the existence of a
non-ens. One of the most predominant themes throughout this chapter is the
constantly re-stated significance of the imminent relationship between the conventional
understanding of phenomena (dharma) and their real nature (dharmata).
The second chapter has a more practical orientation than the first insofar as it
examines the main obscurations (āvaraṇa) to enlightenment (bodhi). These are reduced
to two broad categories, namely, the obscuration that consists in moral defilement and
that which consists in the knowable (kleśa-jñeya-āvaraṇa). Firstly, it identifies
obscuration that is common to the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva. It
then concentrates specifically on the bodhisattva by defining the obscurations to his
attainment of (a) the factors that contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya), (b) the
perfections (pāramitā) and (c) the spiritual levels (bhūmi).
The third chapter provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva). These are
identified as the ten main areas where one's understanding of phenomena as they are in
reality (yatha-bhūta) is susceptible to confusion especially in regard to erroneous
inversion (viparyāsa), imputation and negation. Fundamental to the ten realities are the
24 Cf. MAV-Ţika: Y109.5-6 & 164.23ff.xix
three natures (tri-svabhāva), i.e. the imaginary (parikalpita), the other-dependent (para-
tantra) and the perfected (parinișpanna). These three natures collectively comprise the
basic reality (mūla-tattva) which has an intrinsic relationship with the other nine
realities. The latter half of the chapter is devoted solely to the tenth reality, the reality of
the skills (kausalya-tattva), which leads into a detailed explanation of many of the
essential Buddhist doctrines from the Yogācāra point of view. It includes explanation
