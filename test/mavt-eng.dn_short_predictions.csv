for Hannah and EllieABSTRACT	1
This work contains two main components: (a) an English translation of the	1
Sanskrit texts comprising the Buddhist Yogācāra philosophical work known as the	1
Madhyāntavibhaga. It includes the verses (kārikā) of Maitreya/Asanga, commentary	1
(bhāşya) of Vasubandhu and sub-commentary (fika) of Sthiramati. (b) Text critical	1
remarks for the establishment of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's commentary based	1
upon: (i) a photographed copy of the original manuscript, (ii) the Edited Sanskrit text	1
prepared by S. Yamaguchi and (iii) the Peking and Derge (sde dge) editions of the	1
canonical blockprints of the Tibetan bsTan hgyur.	1
The Madhyāntavibhāga contains an exposition of the analysis (vibhāga) of the	1
middle way (madhya) in relation to the various extreme views (anta). It is arranged in	1
"five chapters: The first chapter, ""the defining characteristics"" (lakšaņa) provides a"	1
detailed account of both the nature of the phenomenal world and the way that it is	1
imaginatively constructed (parikalpyate) in consciousness, as well as the Yogācāra	1
understanding of emptiness (śünyata). Chapter two identifies the main obscurations	1
(avaraṇa) to enlightenment for the śravaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.	1
Chapter three provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva) and their intrinsic	1
relationship with the three natures (svabhāva), i.e the imaginary (parikalpita), the other-	1
dependent (paratantra) and the perfected (parinişpanna). Chapter four is concerned	1
with the development of meditative practices (bhāvanā), the various states (avasthā) of	1
the latter and the results (phala) obtained from those states. Chapter Five extols the	1
virtues of the universal vehicle (mahāyāna) in comparison to the other vehicles	1
especially in regard to spiritual practice (pratipatti), objective support (ālambana) and	1
full attainment (samudāgama).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS	1
V	1
I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the people who, in various ways,	1
made this study possible. Firstly, I wish to thank Professor J. W. de Jong for his	1
guidance both during my early years as a student of the Sanskrit language and literature	1
and in the preparation of this work. Without the benefit of his scholarly expertise and	1
learning the completed work would certainly have been of a much lower standard. I	1
must also thank my co-supervisor, Dr. Tissa Rajapatirana, whose infinite patience and	1
skills as a teacher of the Sanskrit and Tibetan languages made it possible for me to	1
embark upon this project. This work has also benefitted immensely from his	1
corrections and suggested changes made after reading through the entire work in its	1
final stages.	1
I am also in debt to my friend Dr. Michael Comans with whom, as a fellow Ph.D.	1
student at the A.N.U., I had the good fortune to share an office for three years.	1
Michael's discipline and dedication to his task is an inspiration to all who work with	1
him. To Peter Oldmeadow, a true kalyāṇamitra and fellow Ph.D. student, I owe much	1
for having sparked my initial interest in Indian Religions especially in regard to the	1
theory and practice of Buddhism. The value of our discussions on the subject over the	1
years has been immense.	1
Thanks are also due to the other members of the South and West Asia Centre: Dr.	1
Luise Hercus, Dr. Richard Barz and Mr. Yogendra Yadav for their friendship and	1
help. Special thanks are due to the Secretary of the Centre Miss Betty Kat whose good	1
humour, abundant energy and willingness to be of assistance have eased the difficulties	1
on countless occasions.	1
I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Gadjin M. Nagao who kindly	1
provided me with photocopies of the actual manuscript of the Tika used by Susumu	1
Yamaguchi in the preparation of his Sanskrit Edition. Thanks are due to Dr. Johannes	1
Bronkhorst of the Kern Institute who generously provided advice concerning the	1
proper interpretation of a Sanskrit grammatical term used by Sthiramati. I must	1
acknowledge the help of Professor Michael Hahn who first suggested that I enquire of	1
the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project on the expectation that the original	1
manuscript of the Madhyāntavibhāga-ṭīkā may have been re-discovered there and 1	1
must also express my gratitude to Dr. Horst Brinkhaus of the Nepal-German	1
Manuscript Preservation Project who supervised the copying process and ensured that	1
the copy was despatched to Australia without undue delay.vi	1
I am indebted to Professor Monika Theil-Horstmann and Dr. Akira Saito for their	1
generous assistance in the translation of some articles in the German and Japanese	1
languages, respectively, which were essential to my research. Thanks are due also to	1
Mr. Yasuo Tsukada for material support given in the true spirit of dāna.	1
Finally, I wish to thank the Faculty of Asian Studies for the excellent facilities and	1
opportunity to carry out this research.Contents	1

Introduction	1

xii	1
There are three main reasons for this neglect: (a) The MAV- Tīkä stands virtually	1
alone as a broad ranging account of early Yogãcãra thought; consequently it is often	1
not possible to seek help from other parallel texts for a proper understanding of some	1
of its more complex passages. The Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra (MSA) is closely related	1
to the MAV and a study of Sthiramati's commentary will undoubtedly shed more light	1
on the MAV; however, the MSA reflects a more practice oriented doctrine and many	1
of its ideas are generally at an earlier stage of development. There are other shorter	1
works in existence that obviously share common doctrinal elements with the MAV,	1
such as the Dharmadharmatavibhāga and Vasubandhu's Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi;	1
however, these works are relevant only to specific aspects of the early Yogācāra and	1
The Madhyântavibhāga (MAV) contains a comprehensive and detailed account of	1
the philosophical thought of the Yogācāra school of Mahāyāna Buddhism at an early	1
stage of its development. As a systematic exposition of the Mahayana from the	1
perspective of the early Yogācāra it is unique; thus its understanding is fundamental to	1
a proper appreciation of Yogācāra thought.	1
In the Indian Yogacara tradition the MAV comprises three essential works: (a) the	1
Kārikā text attributed to Maitreya / Asanga, (b) Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya and (c) the Țīkā	1
of Sthiramati. Considering that all three of these works have been available for more	1
than fifty years it is remarkable that they have not been comprehensively studied to-	1
date. The French translation and annotation of the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi by Louis de	1
La Vallée Poussin in 1928-292 remains the most authoritative study of the Yogācāra-	1
vijñaptimātra doctrine. However, this work is not representative of the Yogācāra as a	1
whole but is heavily influenced by Dharmapala's interpretation of the thought of	1
Maitreya and Vasubandhu and has fundamental differences from Sthiramati's	1
interpretations as contained in the MAV-Tīka³. Apart from a flurry of scholarly	1
activity that coincided with the publication of the Sanskrit Editions of Sthiramati's	1
Tika in the early 1930's and Vasubandhu's Bhaṣya5 in the 1960's, the MAV has	1
received only piecemeal attention.	1
Commonly known also as the vijñānavāda.	1

are themselves in need of further study. (b) An additional hindrance to the study of	1
this school lies in the fact that the precise meaning of many of the words and concepts	1
employed by Sthiramati is often of quite an enigmatic nature. This is due partly to his	1
terse commentarial style but also because the reader's familiarity with many of the	1
subjects discussed is assumed and no attempt is made at further clarification. In	1
addition, when presenting the alternative views held by other schools Sthiramati never	1
identifies the particular school intended; presumably because this is also assumed to be	1
common knowledge. (c) The third factor that has had an inhibiting influence on the	1
study of the MAV is the quality of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's Tīkä edited and	1
published by S. Yamaguchi. The manuscript used by Yamaguchi was hand-copied	1
from a badly damaged original, a large portion of which was reconstructed with the	1
help of the Tibetan translations. Since it is often impossible to recast much more than	1
the known technical terms from the Tibetan into Sanskrit with any certainty, such an	1
enterprise is never entirely satisfactory and this edition stands in need of improvement.	1
It was the French scholar Sylvain Lévi who first discovered the Sanskrit	1
manuscript of the MAV-Tīka in Nepal in 1928 and arranged to have a copy prepared	1
by hand. Inevitably scribal errors were incorporated during the copying process. As	1
mentioned above, the original manuscript was incomplete with approximately one third	1
of all the folios missing on the left-hand side. The copied manuscript was then	1
entrusted to Susumu Yamaguchi who prepared a Sanskrit edition, the first two	1
chapters of which were published over the next couple of years in various issues of	1
Otani Gakuhō6. Meanwhile, the MAV-Țikã was discovered for a second time in	1
Nepal by Guiseppe Tucci, who, with the help of Vidhusekhara Bhaṭṭācārya, also	1
engaged in the preparation of a Sanskrit edition. Although originally intending to edit	1
and reconstruct the missing portions of the entire text, they eventually published only	1
the first chapter in 19327. This is a work of good quality (in devanagarī script) and the	1
reconstructed sentences are sometimes preferable to those of Yamaguchi's edition. In	1
1934 S. Yamaguchi published an edition of the complete Sanskrit text in five chapters	1
(in Romanised form) which includes the portions recast from the Tibetan. Although	1
this edition of the MAV-ȚIka has many shortcomings, it must be regarded as a	1
significant and valuable scholarly achievement; this edition is used as the basis of the	1
present study.	1

The MAV-Bhäşya then became the focus of scholarly attention with the	1
publication in 1937 of S. Yamaguchi's edition of Vasubandhu's Bhasya which	1
included the Tibetan translation and the Chinese translations of Hsüan-tsang and	1
Paramärtha¹3. In 1953-54 P.W. O'Brien published an English translation of the third	1
chapter of the Bhāṣya in two issues of Monumenta Nipponica¹4. This is a very	1
thorough and readable work based on the Tibetan and Chinese translations and	1
includes abundant references to Sthiramati's Tika (Yamaguchi's ed.) and also to the	1
LVP Kośa and Siddhi. An important contribution to the study of the MAV was made	1
in 1964 when Gadjin M. Nagao published a Sanskrit (Romanised) edition of	1
Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya which incorporates the Karikā text¹5. It was epared from a	1
manuscript discovered in the Ngor Monastery in Tibet by Rahula Sanskrityāyana in	1
1934 and is an exceptionally fine work requiring only a few minor corrections. The	1
publication of this edition now made it possible to revise Yamaguchi's edition of the	1
Tīkä since the latter contains many quotations from the Bhäsya that were reconstructed	1

A Japanese translation of the MAV-Tika was published by S. Yamaguchi in	1
193510,	1
The following year the great Russian scholar of Buddhism Theodore	1
Stcherbatsky published an English translation of just the first chapter of the MA V-	1
Tika. This work which includes a translation of Vasubandhu's Bhãşya from the	1
Tibetan is based on the Tucci and Bhaṭṭācārya edition of the Tika as well as the Tibetan	1
translation. As far as the translation is concerned, it is not a very useful work since it	1
suffers both from Stcherbatsky's somewhat florid and free style as well his many	1
philosophical misconceptions regarding the Yogacara doctrine. However, his text-	1
critical remarks and annotations where he often provides a more literal translation are	1
quite valuable; many are difficult to improve upon and are incorporated in the present	1
study. At the same time that Stcherbatsky was preparing his translation, the Dutch	1
scholar David Friedmann was also translating the first chapter of the Tikå based on	1
Yamaguchi's edition. When he discovered that the Russian scholar was translating the	1
same work, Friedmann almost abandoned his translation but fortunately was persuaded	1
by Stcherbatsky himself to complete his study¹2. The result is a good translation,	1
generally superior to that of Stcherbatsky's and well annotated particularly through its	1
references to the LVP Kośa and Siddhi; however, no attempt has been made to rectify	1
the Sanskrit textual problems.	1

An attempt was made to improve upon Yamaguchi's edition of the Tīkā by the	1
Indian scholar Ramachandra Pandeya who published a revised edition in 197119	1
incorporating the Bhãşya and Kärikā text. In the introduction to this work Pandeya	1
claims that his corrections to Yamaguchi's edition are made on the basis of the Tibetan	1
translation (Peking Ed.). Pandeya's edition was reviewed by J.W. de Jong20 who	1
demonstrated that in many instances his emendations appear to be made quite	1
arbitrarily without recourse to the Tibetan text and for this reason Pandeya's edition has	1
not been consulted in the present study. In his review, de Jong resolves many of the	1
textual problems of the second chapter of the Țikä.	1
In 1982 Thomas A. Kochumuttom published a study of the essential doctrines	1
from the works of Vasubandhu21 which includes an English translation of the first	1
chapter of the MAV-Bhāṣya as well as selected parts of the Tika. Although his	1
translation of the Bhãṣya is generally quite accurate, his translation of the Țika	1
passages (upon which much of his interpretative comment depends) is based on	1
Pandeya's edition which, as we have seen, is not completely reliable. It should be	1
noted that Kochumuttom's understanding of the philosophy of Vasubandhu is	1
controversial for he argues that it is open to interpretation as a system that embraces	1
"""realistic pluralism"". An English translation of the whole MAV-Bhāṣya was included"	1
in a publication by Stephan Anacker in 198422. This is an unsatisfactory work which	1
abounds with errors and misunderstandings 23	1
When my own project was first conceived it was envisaged to have three main	1
components: (a) A translation of the Karika, Bhãşya and Tīkā texts based on Nagao's	1
and Yamaguchi's respective editions. (b) Text-critical annotations to the Yamaguchi	1
edition of the Tika with the help of the Sanskrit Bhāṣya and versions of the	1
Tibetan translation, i.e. the Derge (sde dge) and Peking editions, with the aim of	1
making a significant contribution towards the establishment of a more reliable Sanskrit	1

Tīkā text. (c) Time permitting, I also hoped to produce a preliminary exegesis of the	1
work.	1
Several months after beginning my study I was fortunate enough to discuss my	1
research with Professor M. Hahn of the Indologisches Seminar of the University of	1
Bonn who was visiting the A.N.U. at the time. Following his suggestion I contacted	1
the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project in Kathmandu, Nepal, on the	1
chance that the original manuscript of the MAV-Tīkā were listed among their records.	1
As it turned out, this was in fact the case the Tīkä had indeed been discovered for a	1
third time and was catalogued and microfilmed in 1970 by that organization. Many	1
months later I managed to secure a copy of the manuscript which was photographed	1
from the microfilmed copy. The script of the manuscript is clearly a variety of Nevari	1
and the reproduction is generally of a very high quality, most characters being quite	1
legible as can be seen from the samples shown in Appendix I. It soon became obvious	1
that it was the very manuscript found by Lévi and Tucci more than fifty years earlier	1
although a little worse for wear. When compared with Yamaguchi's edition, the	1
lacunae coincide almost exactly; the only differences being caused by further	1
deterioration along the damaged side of some folios where up to ten characters may be	1
lost. The first folio (1b) is in a particularly bad state with only a small fragment that	1
can be read with certainty. Also, two folios are completely absent (31b and 32a	1
equivalent to Y105.15 to 106.27). The microfilm is kept in the National Archives,	1
Kathmandu, Nepal, and the details found on the title page are as follows: Manuscript	1
No. 5 233 vi bauddhadarśana 66; Catalogue: brhat samkşipta sūcipatram; Title:	1

22.9.70; Remarks: palm-leaf - half of the foll. very badly damaged; Reel No. A38/10.	1
The re-discovery of the original manuscript of the MAV-Țīkâ has thus made it	1
possible to include new material in this study, material that is particularly relevant to the	1
establishment of the Sanskrit text. By comparing the original manuscript with the	1
Yamaguchi edition it has been possible to detect and rectify many mis-readings and	1
scribal errors that were incorporated into the Yamaguchi edition. This aspect of my	1
work has been further complemented through the acquisition of a photo-copy of the	1
actual manuscript used by Yamaguchi which was kindly supplied by Prof. G.M.	1
Nagao.	1
As my research progressed it became apparent that there would not be time to carry	1
out the third component originally envisaged, i.e. the exegesis of the text; rather, the	1
completed study would be restricted to the translation and textual emendations. In	1
addition to the textual problems encountered in the Sanskrit Tīkā, the Tibetan	1
translation is also quite corrupt in many places, thus compounding the difficulties in	1
establishing the Sanskrit. Although I am now reasonably satisfied that the majority of	1
the textual problems have been resolved, the completed work cannot not be regarded as1.	1

definitive or conclusive. The MAV-Tīkā will no doubt yield greater coherence to	1
future scholars and many of its more enigmatic passages will be translated with more	1
certainty only after the writings of Sthiramati are understood in greater depth. Suffice	1
it to say that, although there is considerable scope for improvement through future	1
research, is intended that this study may serve as the basis for a critical edition of the	1
Sanskrit text of the Tika and that the translation will be of value to those seeking a	1
proper understanding of the philosophy and doctrine of the early Yogācāra.	1

V. Bhaṭṭācārya. Calcutta Oriental Series, No.24, 1932.	1
Synopsis of the Madhyāntavibhāga.	1
As its title suggests, the central theme of the Madhyāntavibhāga is the analysis	1
(vibhāga) of the traditional Buddhist concept of the Middle Way (madhya) in relation	1
to the various extreme views (anta) recast to accomodate the spiritual perspective of the	1
Yogācāra. The extremes are normally identified as belonging to two essential	1
categories, i.e. as the extreme views which lead to imputation (samāropa) or negationxviii	1
(apavāda) in regard to the existence (bhava) of phenomena in contrast to the way that	1
they are to be understood in reality. The MAV is arranged in five chapters which deal	1
with seven main subjects: (a) the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa), (b) the obscurations	1
(āvaraṇa), (c) the realities (tattva), (d) the meditative development of counteragents	1
(pratipakṣa-bhāvanā), (e) the various states (avasthā) in the latter, (f) the attainment of	1
results (phala-präpti) and (g) the supremacy of the [universal] vehicle (yānānuttarya).	1
Each chapter concludes with an abridged summary (piņdārtha) of contents which,	1
according to Sthiramati24, is included to enable the student to easily remember both the	1
contents and sequential order of the subjects explained.	1
The first chapter, which is possibly the most complex of the five, provides a	1
detailed account of the essential philosophy of this school. The chapter is divided into	1
two parts: the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of: (a) the imagination of what is unreal	1
(abhūta-parikalpa) and (b) emptiness (śūnyatā). Part (a) explores both the nature of the	1
phenomenal world which is understood in essence as unreal (abhūta), and the way in	1
which it comes into being or is imaginatively constructed (parikalpa). This part is	1
divided into nine sections which include explanations of the three natures (tri-	1
svabhāva), the dynamics of the actualizing consciousnesses (pravṛtti-vijñānāni) and an	1
extremely detailed re-interpretation of the theory of dependent origination (pratitya-	1
samutpāda) according to this school. Part (b) defines the correct understanding of	1
emptiness (śūnyată) in the context of Yogacara thought. This includes a sixteenfold	1
differentiation of emptiness and contains some of the more enigmatic portions of the	1
text particularly where emptiness is described as having some sort of positive	1
ontological value, i.e. the characteristic of emptiness is defined as the existence of a	1
non-ens. One of the most predominant themes throughout this chapter is the	1
constantly re-stated significance of the imminent relationship between the conventional	1
understanding of phenomena (dharma) and their real nature (dharmata).	1
The second chapter has a more practical orientation than the first insofar as it	1
examines the main obscurations (āvaraṇa) to enlightenment (bodhi). These are reduced	1
to two broad categories, namely, the obscuration that consists in moral defilement and	1
that which consists in the knowable (kleśa-jñeya-āvaraṇa). Firstly, it identifies	1
obscuration that is common to the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva. It	1
then concentrates specifically on the bodhisattva by defining the obscurations to his	1
attainment of (a) the factors that contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya), (b) the	1
perfections (pāramitā) and (c) the spiritual levels (bhūmi).	1
The third chapter provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva). These are	1
identified as the ten main areas where one's understanding of phenomena as they are in	1
