MADHYÄNTAVIBHĀGA-BHÃṢYA-ȚIKĀ A Thesis submitted for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the Australian National University April, 1988 Richard StanleyThis thesis is the result of my own research carried out while enrolled as a Ph.D. candidate at the Australian National University 1984 1988.	0
Richard Star Richard StanleyDedication for Hannah and EllieABSTRACT	0
Sanskrit texts comprising the Buddhist Yogācāra philosophical work known as the Madhyāntavibhaga.	1
It includes the verses (kārikā) of Maitreya/Asanga, commentary (bhāşya) of Vasubandhu and sub-commentary (fika) of Sthiramati.	0
(b) Text critical remarks for the establishment of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's commentary based upon: (i) a photographed copy of the original manuscript, (ii) the Edited Sanskrit text prepared by S. Yamaguchi and (iii) the Peking and Derge (sde dge) editions of the canonical blockprints of the Tibetan bsTan hgyur.	0
The Madhyāntavibhāga contains an exposition of the analysis (vibhāga) of the middle way (madhya) in relation to the various extreme views (anta).	0
It is arranged in five chapters: The first chapter, "the defining characteristics" (lakšaņa) provides a detailed account of both the nature of the phenomenal world and the way that it is imaginatively constructed (parikalpyate) in consciousness, as well as the Yogācāra understanding of emptiness (śünyata).	0
Chapter two identifies the main obscurations (avaraṇa) to enlightenment for the śravaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.	1
relationship with the three natures (svabhāva), i.e the imaginary (parikalpita), the other- dependent (paratantra) and the perfected (parinişpanna).	1
Chapter four is concerned with the development of meditative practices (bhāvanā), the various states (avasthā) of the latter and the results (phala) obtained from those states.	1
Chapter Five extols the virtues of the universal vehicle (mahāyāna) in comparison to the other vehicles especially in regard to spiritual practice (pratipatti), objective support (ālambana) and full attainment (samudāgama).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS	1
made this study possible.	1
Firstly, I wish to thank Professor J. W. de Jong for his guidance both during my early years as a student of the Sanskrit language and literature and in the preparation of this work.	0
Without the benefit of his scholarly expertise and learning the completed work would certainly have been of a much lower standard.	1
I must also thank my co-supervisor, Dr. Tissa Rajapatirana, whose infinite patience and skills as a teacher of the Sanskrit and Tibetan languages made it possible for me to embark upon this project.	1
This work has also benefitted immensely from his corrections and suggested changes made after reading through the entire work in its final stages.	0
I am also in debt to my friend Dr. Michael Comans with whom, as a fellow Ph.D. student at the A.N.U., I had the good fortune to share an office for three years.	1
Michael's discipline and dedication to his task is an inspiration to all who work with him.	1
To Peter Oldmeadow, a true kalyāṇamitra and fellow Ph.D. student, I owe much for having sparked my initial interest in Indian Religions especially in regard to the theory and practice of Buddhism.	0
The value of our discussions on the subject over the years has been immense.	1
Thanks are also due to the other members of the South and West Asia Centre: Dr. Luise Hercus, Dr. Richard Barz and Mr. Yogendra Yadav for their friendship and help.	0
Special thanks are due to the Secretary of the Centre Miss Betty Kat whose good humour, abundant energy and willingness to be of assistance have eased the difficulties on countless occasions.	1
I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Gadjin M. Nagao who kindly provided me with photocopies of the actual manuscript of the Tika used by Susumu Yamaguchi in the preparation of his Sanskrit Edition.	0
Thanks are due to Dr. Johannes Bronkhorst of the Kern Institute who generously provided advice concerning the proper interpretation of a Sanskrit grammatical term used by Sthiramati.	0
I must acknowledge the help of Professor Michael Hahn who first suggested that I enquire of the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project on the expectation that the original manuscript of the Madhyāntavibhāga-ṭīkā may have been re-discovered there and 1	0

Susumu Yamaguchi's edition of the Madhyântavibhāga-Țikā: Sthiramati Madhyāntavibhāgatīkā.३ Introduction There are three main reasons for this neglect: (a) The MAV- Tīkä stands virtually alone as a broad ranging account of early Yogãcãra thought; consequently it is often not possible to seek help from other parallel texts for a proper understanding of some of its more complex passages.	0
The Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra (MSA) is closely related to the MAV and a study of Sthiramati's commentary will undoubtedly shed more light on the MAV; however, the MSA reflects a more practice oriented doctrine and many of its ideas are generally at an earlier stage of development.	0
There are other shorter works in existence that obviously share common doctrinal elements with the MAV, such as the Dharmadharmatavibhāga and Vasubandhu's Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi; however, these works are relevant only to specific aspects of the early Yogācāra and	0
the philosophical thought of the Yogācāra school of Mahāyāna Buddhism at an early stage of its development.	0
As a systematic exposition of the Mahayana from the perspective of the early Yogācāra it is unique; thus its understanding is fundamental to a proper appreciation of Yogācāra thought.	0
In the Indian Yogacara tradition the MAV comprises three essential works: (a) the Kārikā text attributed to Maitreya / Asanga, (b) Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya and (c) the Țīkā of Sthiramati.	0
Considering that all three of these works have been available for more than fifty years it is remarkable that they have not been comprehensively studied to- date.	1
The French translation and annotation of the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi by Louis de La Vallée Poussin in 1928-292 remains the most authoritative study of the Yogācāra- vijñaptimātra doctrine.	0
However, this work is not representative of the Yogācāra as a whole but is heavily influenced by Dharmapala's interpretation of the thought of Maitreya and Vasubandhu and has fundamental differences from Sthiramati's interpretations as contained in the MAV-Tīka³.	0
Apart from a flurry of scholarly activity that coincided with the publication of the Sanskrit Editions of Sthiramati's Tika in the early 1930's and Vasubandhu's Bhaṣya5 in the 1960's, the MAV has received only piecemeal attention.	1

this school lies in the fact that the precise meaning of many of the words and concepts employed by Sthiramati is often of quite an enigmatic nature.	1
This is due partly to his terse commentarial style but also because the reader's familiarity with many of the subjects discussed is assumed and no attempt is made at further clarification.	0
In addition, when presenting the alternative views held by other schools Sthiramati never identifies the particular school intended; presumably because this is also assumed to be common knowledge.	0
(c) The third factor that has had an inhibiting influence on the study of the MAV is the quality of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's Tīkä edited and published by S. Yamaguchi.	1
The manuscript used by Yamaguchi was hand-copied from a badly damaged original, a large portion of which was reconstructed with the help of the Tibetan translations.	1
Since it is often impossible to recast much more than the known technical terms from the Tibetan into Sanskrit with any certainty, such an enterprise is never entirely satisfactory and this edition stands in need of improvement.	1
It was the French scholar Sylvain Lévi who first discovered the Sanskrit manuscript of the MAV-Tīka in Nepal in 1928 and arranged to have a copy prepared by hand.	0
Inevitably scribal errors were incorporated during the copying process.	1
As mentioned above, the original manuscript was incomplete with approximately one third of all the folios missing on the left-hand side.	1
The copied manuscript was then entrusted to Susumu Yamaguchi who prepared a Sanskrit edition, the first two chapters of which were published over the next couple of years in various issues of Otani Gakuhō6.	0
Meanwhile, the MAV-Țikã was discovered for a second time in Nepal by Guiseppe Tucci, who, with the help of Vidhusekhara Bhaṭṭācārya, also	0
and reconstruct the missing portions of the entire text, they eventually published only the first chapter in 19327.	0
This is a work of good quality (in devanagarī script) and the reconstructed sentences are sometimes preferable to those of Yamaguchi's edition.	1
In 1934 S. Yamaguchi published an edition of the complete Sanskrit text in five chapters (in Romanised form) which includes the portions recast from the Tibetan.	0
Although this edition of the MAV-ȚIka has many shortcomings, it must be regarded as a significant and valuable scholarly achievement; this edition is used as the basis of the present study.	0
pp.59-99.	0
This work was reviewed by E. Obermiller in IHQ, Vol.	0
IX, 1933, (pp.1019-1030) where he suggests some valuable alternative readings, especially in the reconstructed portions.	0
The MAV-Bhäşya then became the focus of scholarly attention with the publication in 1937 of S. Yamaguchi's edition of Vasubandhu's Bhasya which included the Tibetan translation and the Chinese translations of Hsüan-tsang and Paramärtha¹3.	0
In 1953-54 P.W.	0
O'Brien published an English translation of the third chapter of the Bhāṣya in two issues of Monumenta Nipponica¹4.	0
This is a very thorough and readable work based on the Tibetan and Chinese translations and includes abundant references to Sthiramati's Tika (Yamaguchi's ed.)	0
and also to the LVP Kośa and Siddhi.	1
An important contribution to the study of the MAV was made in 1964 when Gadjin M. Nagao published a Sanskrit (Romanised) edition of Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya which incorporates the Karikā text¹5.	0
It was epared from a manuscript discovered in the Ngor Monastery in Tibet by Rahula Sanskrityāyana in 1934 and is an exceptionally fine work requiring only a few minor corrections.	0
The publication of this edition now made it possible to revise Yamaguchi's edition of the Tīkä since the latter contains many quotations from the Bhäsya that were reconstructed	0
Stcherbatsky published an English translation of just the first chapter of the MA V- Tika.	0
This work which includes a translation of Vasubandhu's Bhãşya from the Tibetan is based on the Tucci and Bhaṭṭācārya edition of the Tika as well as the Tibetan translation.	0
As far as the translation is concerned, it is not a very useful work since it suffers both from Stcherbatsky's somewhat florid and free style as well his many philosophical misconceptions regarding the Yogacara doctrine.	0
However, his text- critical remarks and annotations where he often provides a more literal translation are quite valuable; many are difficult to improve upon and are incorporated in the present study.	0
At the same time that Stcherbatsky was preparing his translation, the Dutch scholar David Friedmann was also translating the first chapter of the Tikå based on Yamaguchi's edition.	0
When he discovered that the Russian scholar was translating the same work, Friedmann almost abandoned his translation but fortunately was persuaded by Stcherbatsky himself to complete his study¹2.	0
The result is a good translation, generally superior to that of Stcherbatsky's and well annotated particularly through its references to the LVP Kośa and Siddhi; however, no attempt has been made to rectify the Sanskrit textual problems.	0

Nagao also published a Japanese translation of chapters I and III of the Bhāṣya¹6 and a translation of the whole Bhāṣya in 1976?17 Another edition of the Sanskrit Bhäşya was published in 1967 by Nathmal Tatia and Anantalal Thakur ¹8.	0
An attempt was made to improve upon Yamaguchi's edition of the Tīkā by the Indian scholar Ramachandra Pandeya who published a revised edition in 197119 incorporating the Bhãşya and Kärikā text.	0
In the introduction to this work Pandeya claims that his corrections to Yamaguchi's edition are made on the basis of the Tibetan translation (Peking Ed.).	0
Pandeya's edition was reviewed by J.W.	0
de Jong20 who demonstrated that in many instances his emendations appear to be made quite arbitrarily without recourse to the Tibetan text and for this reason Pandeya's edition has not been consulted in the present study.	0
In his review, de Jong resolves many of the textual problems of the second chapter of the Țikä.	0
In 1982 Thomas A. Kochumuttom published a study of the essential doctrines from the works of Vasubandhu21 which includes an English translation of the first chapter of the MAV-Bhāṣya as well as selected parts of the Tika.	0
Although his translation of the Bhãṣya is generally quite accurate, his translation of the Țika passages (upon which much of his interpretative comment depends) is based on Pandeya's edition which, as we have seen, is not completely reliable.	0
It should be noted that Kochumuttom's understanding of the philosophy of Vasubandhu is controversial for he argues that it is open to interpretation as a system that embraces "realistic pluralism".	0

Several months after beginning my study I was fortunate enough to discuss my research with Professor M. Hahn of the Indologisches Seminar of the University of Bonn who was visiting the A.N.U.	0
at the time.	0
Following his suggestion I contacted the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project in Kathmandu, Nepal, on the chance that the original manuscript of the MAV-Tīkā were listed among their records.	0
As it turned out, this was in fact the case the Tīkä had indeed been discovered for a third time and was catalogued and microfilmed in 1970 by that organization.	0
Many months later I managed to secure a copy of the manuscript which was photographed from the microfilmed copy.	1
The script of the manuscript is clearly a variety of Nevari and the reproduction is generally of a very high quality, most characters being quite legible as can be seen from the samples shown in Appendix I.	0
It soon became obvious that it was the very manuscript found by Lévi and Tucci more than fifty years earlier although a little worse for wear.	0
When compared with Yamaguchi's edition, the lacunae coincide almost exactly; the only differences being caused by further deterioration along the damaged side of some folios where up to ten characters may be lost.	1
The first folio (1b) is in a particularly bad state with only a small fragment that can be read with certainty.	1
Also, two folios are completely absent (31b and 32a equivalent to Y105.15 to 106.27).	0
The microfilm is kept in the National Archives, Kathmandu, Nepal, and the details found on the title page are as follows: Manuscript No.	0

The re-discovery of the original manuscript of the MAV-Țīkâ has thus made it possible to include new material in this study, material that is particularly relevant to the establishment of the Sanskrit text.	0
By comparing the original manuscript with the Yamaguchi edition it has been possible to detect and rectify many mis-readings and scribal errors that were incorporated into the Yamaguchi edition.	1
This aspect of my work has been further complemented through the acquisition of a photo-copy of the actual manuscript used by Yamaguchi which was kindly supplied by Prof. G.M.	0
Nagao.	1
As my research progressed it became apparent that there would not be time to carry out the third component originally envisaged, i.e.	0
the exegesis of the text; rather, the completed study would be restricted to the translation and textual emendations.	1
In addition to the textual problems encountered in the Sanskrit Tīkā, the Tibetan translation is also quite corrupt in many places, thus compounding the difficulties in establishing the Sanskrit.	0
Although I am now reasonably satisfied that the majority of the textual problems have been resolved, the completed work cannot not be regarded as1.	0
definitive or conclusive.	1
The MAV-Tīkā will no doubt yield greater coherence to future scholars and many of its more enigmatic passages will be translated with more certainty only after the writings of Sthiramati are understood in greater depth.	0
Suffice it to say that, although there is considerable scope for improvement through future research, is intended that this study may serve as the basis for a critical edition of the Sanskrit text of the Tika and that the translation will be of value to those seeking a proper understanding of the philosophy and doctrine of the early Yogācāra.	0

Madhyāntavibhāga-Tīkā, [Chapter One] Sanskrit text edited by G. Tucci & V. Bhaṭṭācārya.	0
Calcutta Oriental Series, No.24, 1932.	0
As its title suggests, the central theme of the Madhyāntavibhāga is the analysis (vibhāga) of the traditional Buddhist concept of the Middle Way (madhya) in relation to the various extreme views (anta) recast to accomodate the spiritual perspective of the Yogācāra.	0
The extremes are normally identified as belonging to two essential categories, i.e.	1
as the extreme views which lead to imputation (samāropa) or negationxviii (apavāda) in regard to the existence (bhava) of phenomena in contrast to the way that they are to be understood in reality.	1
The MAV is arranged in five chapters which deal with seven main subjects: (a) the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa), (b) the obscurations (āvaraṇa), (c) the realities (tattva), (d) the meditative development of counteragents (pratipakṣa-bhāvanā), (e) the various states (avasthā) in the latter, (f) the attainment of results (phala-präpti) and (g) the supremacy of the [universal] vehicle (yānānuttarya).	0
Each chapter concludes with an abridged summary (piņdārtha) of contents which, according to Sthiramati24, is included to enable the student to easily remember both the contents and sequential order of the subjects explained.	0
The first chapter, which is possibly the most complex of the five, provides a detailed account of the essential philosophy of this school.	0
The chapter is divided into two parts: the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of: (a) the imagination of what is unreal (abhūta-parikalpa) and (b) emptiness (śūnyatā).	1
Part (a) explores both the nature of the phenomenal world which is understood in essence as unreal (abhūta), and the way in which it comes into being or is imaginatively constructed (parikalpa).	0
This part is divided into nine sections which include explanations of the three natures (tri- svabhāva), the dynamics of the actualizing consciousnesses (pravṛtti-vijñānāni) and an extremely detailed re-interpretation of the theory of dependent origination (pratitya- samutpāda) according to this school.	0
Part (b) defines the correct understanding of emptiness (śūnyată) in the context of Yogacara thought.	1
This includes a sixteenfold differentiation of emptiness and contains some of the more enigmatic portions of the text particularly where emptiness is described as having some sort of positive ontological value, i.e.	0
the characteristic of emptiness is defined as the existence of a	1
constantly re-stated significance of the imminent relationship between the conventional understanding of phenomena (dharma) and their real nature (dharmata).	1
The second chapter has a more practical orientation than the first insofar as it examines the main obscurations (āvaraṇa) to enlightenment (bodhi).	0
These are reduced to two broad categories, namely, the obscuration that consists in moral defilement and that which consists in the knowable (kleśa-jñeya-āvaraṇa).	1
Firstly, it identifies obscuration that is common to the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.	1
It then concentrates specifically on the bodhisattva by defining the obscurations to his attainment of (a) the factors that contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya), (b) the perfections (pāramitā) and (c) the spiritual levels (bhūmi).	0
The third chapter provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva).	1
These are identified as the ten main areas where one's understanding of phenomena as they are in reality (yatha-bhūta) is susceptible to confusion especially in regard to erroneous inversion (viparyāsa), imputation and negation.	1
Fundamental to the ten realities are the	1
tantra) and the perfected (parinișpanna).	1
These three natures collectively comprise the basic reality (mūla-tattva) which has an intrinsic relationship with the other nine realities.	1
The latter half of the chapter is devoted solely to the tenth reality, the reality of the skills (kausalya-tattva), which leads into a detailed explanation of many of the essential Buddhist doctrines from the Yogācāra point of view.	0
It includes explanation of the meaning of the five aggregates (pańca-skandha), the elements (dhātu) and the sense-fields (ayatana).	1
various aspects of spiritual practice (pratipatti).	0
These are: (a) the correct practices of meditative development (bhāvanā) for the generation of the thirty-seven factors that contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya).	1
The practices are examined through their modes as counteragents (pratipakṣa) to particular adverse elements (vipakşa).	1
These factors include the applications of mindfulness (smṛty-upasthāna), the correct exertions (samyak-prahāna) and the bases of psychic power (ṛddhi-päda).	1
(b) The nine states (avastha) which define the progress of the bodhisattva engaged in these meditative practices.	1
(c) The respective results (phala) that are attained by the bodhisattva	1
its superiority over the śrävaka-yana and the pratyekabuddha-yāna.	1
This superiority is explained in relation to three categories: (a) spiritual practice (pratipatti) that is based on the ten perfections, (b) objective support (alambana) which is twelvefold and (c) full attainment (samudāgama) which is tenfold.	1
The chapter depends heavily on the Kāśyapaparivarta section of the Ratnakūṭa for a scriptural basis.	1
The Authorship of the Madhyäntavibhāga The Madhyāntavibhäga [-Kärikā) is one of the five treatises which the Mahāyāna Buddhists traditionally ascribe to Maitreyanatha, the bodhisattva and incumbent Buddha who resides in the Tuşita Heavens.	0
The legendary accounts in the Tibetan tradition 25 tell of his materialization in the presence of the Arya Asang: after he had completed twelve gruelling years of meditative practices.	1
After transporting Asanga to the Tuşita Heavens, it is said that Maitreya instructed him in the fundamental doctrines of the Mahāyāna and then passed on to him five important treatises to be taught for the benefit of sentient beings.	1

Simla: Indian Institute of Advanced Study, 1970.26 No such confusion exists concerning the historicity of Vasubandhu, the author of the MAV-Bhäşya; rather, it is over the actual number of Vasubandhus that contemporary scholars are unable to reach agreement.	0
Traditionally it is believed that there was only one Vasubandhu, who was the younger brother of Asanga.	1
Paramārtha ³ 33 reports that he was born in Purușapura (modern day Peshawar) in the eleventh century after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha and that he was initially allied with various sarvästivāda schools.	0
During this time he composed his definitive work illustrating the vaibhășika and sauträntika doctrines in the Abhidharmakośa and Bhasya.	1
Although originally he was a staunch skeptic of the Mahāyana, is said that through the efforts of Asanga he eventually became convinced of its theoretical and	1
Dharmadharmatāvibhāga Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra Ratnagotravibhāga [Uttaratantra] Abhisamāyālamkāra The first three of these stand in close relation as works belonging to the early strata of the Yogacära.	0
The fourth, wherein the tathāgatagarbha doctrine features prominently, has some links with the Yogăcăra (particularly the MSA) but is classified as belonging to the Madhyamika-prasangika school by certain Tibetan writers, notably Tson kha pa26.	0
The fifth is generally regarded as a Madhyamaka work which presents the bodhisattva path based on the Prajñāpāramitā literature.	0
For the past sixty years scholars have remained divided over the precise identity of Maitreyanātha with some, notably U₁27 and Tucci28 preferring to explain him as a historical personage.	0
Others such as Obermiller29 and Demiéville ³0 argue quite convincingly that Maitreya is intended as the tutelary inspiration of Asanga and	0
Obermiller³1 has already drawn attention to the fact that it is in the MA V-Țīkā³2 that Maitreya is explicitly described as the bodhisattva who has reached the tenth spiritual level and is separated from Buddhahood by just one birth thus adding credence to his identification as a tutelary entity.	0

Mahāyāna, five hundred of his disciples also made the transition.	1
He is credited with the authorship of numerous original works and commentaries 34 and his reputation for excellence in meditative practices and learning was known throughout the North of India.	1
After the death of Asanga, Vasubandhu became upadhyāya (Abbot) of Nalanda and Taranātha records that he was responsible for the creation of 654 Dharma centres in and around Magadha.	0
The dates of Vasubandhu are problematical.	1
Some scholars argue in favour of the acceptance of more than one author with this name during the period of the third to fifth centuries A.D., while others maintain that the available evidence does not allow for such an interpretation³5.	0
It is a particularly hazy area of study that is based essentially on attempts to reconcile the Tibetan and Chinese historical accounts and hence necessarily contains considerable supposition and speculation.	0
Suffice to say that Vasubandhu, the author of the MAV-Bhäsya, probably lived during the third and fourth centuries A.D. Bu-ston describes Sthiramati as a pupil of Vasubandhu who was more learned in the Abhidharma than his teacher.	0
He is reputed to have joined Vasubandhu at the age of seven and worked diligently at his studies until becoming proficient in all the five sciences.	1
According to the Chinese pilgrim I-Tsing36, Sthiramati was at Nalanda for some years before moving on to Valabhi where he established a monastery and composed most of his works.	0
He was a prolific writer who wrote sub-commentaries to most of Vasubandhu's commentaries in addition to numerous other works 37.	0
Scholars are in rough agreement concerning his dates which can be put approximately at 500-570 A.D.38 For a complete list of his works as recorded in the Tibetan bs Tan hgyur see L. Chimpa & A. Chattopadhyaya: Taranatha's History...., pp.395-7.	0

The arrangement of topics and sub-topics under their respective headings follows Nagao's edition of the Sanskrit Bhāṣya and sometimes differs slightly to the arrangement of Yamaguchi's edition of the Tika.	1
The Karikä and Bhāṣya text is translated in bold type and is placed immediately above the relevant Țikä text.	0
When the Kärikä or Bhãşya is quoted in the Tika, this is also rendered in bold type.	1
The numbers in the left-hand margin indicate: (a) the page number of the Sanskrit texts when a page break occurs or (b) the page and line number of the Sanskrit texts at the beginning of a new topic.	1
The paragraph divisions of the Tīka generally followXxili Yamaguchi's arrangement although this is occasionally changed for the sake of a more coherent separation of Sthiramati's argument and discussion.	0
I have aimed for consistency in the choice of an English term for its Sanskrit or Tibetan equivalent although this principle is occasionally waived when it is felt that the context demands a different nuance.	1
For example, svabhāva is usually translated as "own-being", but when used in the context of the tri-svabhāva doctrine, it is rendered as "nature" as is the normal practice of most contempory commentators.	1
Due to their multivalent meaning and cumbersome English equivalents, some Sanskrit words have not been translated: the word dharina is not translated when its sense as "constituent of reality", or "ontological category" etc.	1
is intended; when it is used to refer to the doctrine or teachings of the Buddha, it is rendered as "Dharma".	1
Where the word karma is used chiefly in the sense of "action" it is translated as such, however, it is not translated when it is clear that its other more abstract moral connotations (as the fruition of the actions of the past) are intended.	1
The word jñāna is usually rendered as "knowledge" and occasionally "cognition" except when it signifies the knowledge that is free from conceptual discrimination (nirvikalpa), in which case it is translated as "direct intuition".	1
This latter sense is often clarified by the Tibetan translation which renders it as ye ses rather than ses pa. My fundamental principle when translating both Bhāṣya and Țikā has been to take the Sanskrit text as the reference point.	0
If it reads differently to the Tibetan but maintains coherence both syntactically and philosophically, its reading is adopted in preference to the Tibetan and the latter is noted as a variant.	1
In the case of the Tika, any difference between the manuscript reading and Yamaguchi's text is noted.	1
If a coherent rendering is not possible from the manuscript, the Tibetan forms the basis of the translation and an emendation to the Sanskrit is suggested.	1
The translation of the missing portions of the manuscript is always based on the Tibetan, and an improvement is annotated where I am unable to agree with Yamaguchi's reconstruction.Index by Paragraph Chapter One Introduction The 'Body' of the Treatise The Defining Characteristics 1.	0

When respect is paid to one who possesses virtue and is beneficent, merit is accumulated; when merit is accu- mulated, with little effort one completes one's enterprise which is unafflicted by impediments and hindrances.	1

Vasubandhu, after receiving the teaching from him, composed the commentary to it.	1
Reverence is generated towards the commentary because the meaning of the Sutra is unerringly stated in it because these two, since they possess the highest wisdoms, are able to understand, retain and explain [it], without erring.	1
In this way reverence arises towards both the Sutra and the commentary on the part of those who rely on the authority of individual people.	1
Also, on the part of those who rely on the Dharma, reverence arises towards both the author and the expounder because after the true meaning of the Sutra and the commentary has been understood, when a positive deter- mination occurs, it is brought about through the understanding of the author and the expounder; but is not accomplished through just speculation and scriptural tradition?	1

This now should be discussed: what is the nature of a treatise and why is it [described as] a śästra ?	1
A treatise consists in representations/conceptualizations appearing as groups of names, words, and syllables.	1
Or rather, a treatise consists in representations appearing as specific words that cause the attainment of supramundane direct intuition.	1
[Objection]: How can representations be formulated or commented upon?	1
[Response]: There is no fault here since the hearer's representations arise from the representations of the author and the expounder.	1
It is a treatise (śästra) because it is an instruction for novices (sisya-śāsana) ¹0.	1
In order to generate excellence in moral- ity, meditative concentration and wisdom, an instruction for novices dissuades them from the actions of body, speech and mind that do not produce the accumulations [of merit and direct intuition], and induces them [to engage] in actions that produce the	1
of a treatisell.	1
The characteristic of a treatise consists in the fact that, when the teaching is practised, one relinquishes moral defilements along with their latent impressions and is also protected from both becoming and the wretched states of existence which are	1

Therefore, it has the characteristic of a treatise (śāstra) because it rules over (śāsana) the enemy-like moral defilements, and because it protects (trāṇa)13 from becoming and the wretched states of existence.	1
Moreover, this pair [i.e.	1
'ruling over' and 'protecting'] are found in all works of the universal vehicle and in their interpre- tations but nowhere else hence this [work] is a treatise [śästra].	1
It is said: That which rules over the enemy-like moral defilements in their entirety; which rescues [beings from the wretched states of exist- ence and becoming, is a treatise, by virtue of its authority and protection.	1
These two are non-existent in any other doctrinal view.	1
Of this; the term "of this" is a direct reference to the verses of the Madhyānta- vibhāga śāstra which is a compendium of seven topics and enables the relinquishment of obscuration that consists both in moral defilement and the knowable, by way of the	1

One who has relinquished the obscurations of all latent impressions, who has the understanding of all the dharmas, in every respect, for his essential nature, who is the basis of all might,	1

This being the case, an entity that is to be known21 in all its aspects appears to a bodhisattva established on the tenth spiritual level like a myrobalan fruit on the palm of his hand; however it is as though his eyes were covered by a fine silk veil.	1
But for the Venerable One, the cover- ing over the eyes is removed as it were this is the difference.	1
By the term "son of the sugata" in this context [i.e.	1
here sugata means perfectly understood], the perfect under- standing of reality is indicated on the part of the author of the treatise, and similarly perfect compassion and perfect wisdom [are indicated] through his authorship of the treatise without regard for gain and honour.	1

capable of performing all benefit for all sentient beings effortlessly and who has the nature of the excellence of direct intuition free from conceptual differentiation - he is the sugata.	1
His nature consists in the thusness of purity 19.	1
Since his direct intuition which is free from conceptual differentiation is brought forth20 from the latter, the son of the sugata is born from, or in, that [thusness of purity].	1

It also implies that he (Vasubandhu) pays respect to the other Buddhas and bodhisattvas, not only to the author and the expounder.	1

(c) dharmas, (d) moral discipline and (e) expedients, may believe that these are difficult to discern individually because of their infinite differentiation; hence he says: (a) the characteristic, (b) obscu- ration, (c) reality etc.	1
In this regard, the 'body' of the treatise is respectively determined from the beginning 32.	1
"In this regard" [means]: in regard to the critical examination of the subjects of the treatise, or else, in regard to the treatise [itself].	1
"From the begin- ning" [means]: from the very outset.	0
The term "treatise" has already been elucidated 33.	1
Its 'body' is an abridgement or summary meaning; or it is the 'body' in the sense of a basis.	1
For, just as the physical body, which has the external and internal sense-fields for its basis, is described as a 'body', similarly, the subjects upon which a treatise depends and proceeds form its 'body'; and these subjects are seven, beginning with the	1
the knowable and moral defilement together with their latent impressions.	1
Further- more, concerning the insubstantiality of the dharmas, this treatise is undertaken in order to present the insubstantiality of the dharmas as it is in reality by refuting these two incompatible views: (a) that the non-existence of all dharmas is [equivalent to] the insubstantiality of the dharmas, and (b) that the non-existence of an internally active being is [equivalent to the insubstantiality of the dharmas³0	1

[Objection]: is it not so that this 'body' will be discerned just through an understanding of the treatise and thus its respective determination at the beginning serves no purpose?	1
[Response]: No, it is not without purpose for the subjects are helpful for novices because a novice who has an appreciation of the subjects understands the details with ease when they are being discussed, like a horse galloping without fear on familiar ground 35, it is not for any other reason.	1
For these seven subjects are expounded 36 in this treatise.	1
What is meant by this statement is that the 'body' of the treatise is complete 37.	1
By "these" (is meant] the [subjects] beginning with the char- acteristic that are listed.	1
"Seven" is their number; it is an enumeration in order to reveal the total 38.	1
They are subjects (artha) because they are sought (arthyante), i.e.	1
insofar as they are understood.	1
By "in this treatise" is meant: in [this work) titled the Madhyānta- vibhāga.	1
By "expounded" is meant: "explained" or "ascertained"39.	1
Namely40; this is the term that introduces these bjects.	1
The characteristic; it is a characteristic (lakṣaṇa) insofar as [things) are characterized (lakṣyante) by this.	1
And it is twofold: the characteristic of defilement and the characteristic of purification.	1
Of these, the char- acteristic of defilement is ninefold, beginning with: "there is unreal imagination" (I.la), and concluding with: "because of the seven kinds of unreal imagination" (I.11d).	1
The characteristic of purification is explained in the remaining half [of the first chapter].	1
[Objection]: If it is said that it is a characteristic because [something] is characterized by it, this being the case, the characteristic would be something different from defile- ment and purification.	1
[Response]: This is not so because the characteristic of some- thing is none other than its own-being.	1
For example, the element earth has the char- acteristic of solidity, and the element earth is not something separate from solidity, Alternatively, it is a characteristic insofar as [something] is characterized as that.	1
For thus, defilement and purification are characteristics insofar as [something] is charac- terized as being of the nature of defilement or purification.	1
Or again, the characteristic of both defilement and purification is a twofold characteristic: the individual character- istic and the universal characteristic.	1
Obscuration (ävaraṇa) is so-called because it conceals (avṛṇoti) the wholesome dharmas; or else, it is an obscuration (avaraṇa) since the wholesome dharmas are concealed (vriyante) by it since it prevents their arising.	1
Furthermore, these obscurations have fifty-three modes.	1
Reality implies that 'this'	1

what is meant is: it is free from erroneous inversion and it has ten modes.	1
The counteragent is the side that has the relinquishment of the adverse elements for its	1
to the particular [states] of that [path] which arise in a continuous sequence.	1
This has nineteen modes beginning with the state of the spiritual lineage.	1
The attainment of the result42; i.e.	1
obtaining the 'fruit'; this has fifteen modes beginning with the karma- result.	1
The supremacy of the vehicle; it is a vehicle since one travels by it, and since it is a vehicle and is also supreme, it is described as the supremacy of the vehicle.	1
Furthermore, it is threefold beginning with the supremacy of spiritual practice.	1
He states that this is the seventh subject so as to delimit (the exact number of subjects] and also to [show] their sequential order.	0
Just this many subjects are explained, i.e.	1
there are none other than these.	1
Now, this sequence is for conformity with supramundane direct intuition; for thus the bodhisattva stationed at the spiritual level43 of one who courses in firm conviction and is established in morality, should firstly become skilled in defilement and purifi- cation.	1
Then, that particular obscuration to each wholesome dharma should be known	1
quish what has not been discerned 44 since the fault is not seen.	0
Then, that objective support through which the mind is liberated from a particular obscuration should be understood as reality 45.	1
After that, the application which destroys that obscuration on account of that particular objective support is to be known as the meditative develop- ment of the counteragent.	1
Then, owing to the diminution of the adverse elements and the increase in the counteragent, the state in regard to that meditative development of the counteragent should be known as the state of the spiritual lineage etc.	1
Following from that there is the actual presence of the supramundane dharmas, i.e.	1
the results which should be known as the result of winning the stream etc.	1
And this whole [sequential progression] is common to the bodhisattvas and the śrävakas together with their novices46 as has been stated in a Sutra: "this recluse is trained in the instructions, conduct, associations and modes of address of the śrävaka, is trained in the instruc- tions, conduct, associations and modes of address of the pratyekabuddha, is trained in the instructions, conduct, associations and modes of address of the bodhisattva."	1
However, since the supremacy of the bodhisattva is not common [to the others), supremacy is the seventh subject.	1

Of these, defilement is [equivalent to] obscuration, and purification is [equivalent to] a reality; and since the relinquishment of obscuration is due to the understanding of reality, hence the [subjects of obscuration and reality [follow in successive order].	1
After that comes the counteragent together with its associated elements, i.e.	1
the path, in order to demonstrate the expedients for the relinquishment of that [obscuration].	1
The state therein [is then explained] in order to demonstrate the	1
end of the path.	1
And since the state brings a corresponding result, the result [is explained] immediately after that.	1
All these are common to the bodhisattva and the śrävaka etc., thus the supremacy of the vehicle [is then explained] in order to proclaim that the universal vehicle is not common [to the śrāvaka etc.].	1
Others again say that the characteristic is stated at the beginning in order to show the characteristics of existence and non-existence.	1
When the characteristic is known, obscuration should be relinquished and reality should be realized, thus, immediately after that, obscuration and reality [are explained].	1
The meditative development of the counteragent [is explained next] since this is the expedient for both the relinquishment and realization [respectively] of the latter two and the special states are (equivalent to] the successive degrees of that [meditative development].	0
And the result is the relin- quishment caused by the latter.	1
In order to demonstrate that immediately after that	1
Others now believe 49 that the explanation of the characteristic for the purpose of relinquishing negation and imputation for one who is confused about the existence or non-existence of the dharmas.	1
Obscuration is for the purpose of [developing] skill in regard to obscuration for one whose confusion has been relinquished.	1
Since reality is obscured by the latter, reality comes immediately after that for the purpose of [developing] skill in regard to reality.	1
Since there is the relinquishment of obscuration through meditative development which penetrates reality50, the meditative development of the counteragent [is explained] immediately after reality.	1
In order to develop skill in the classification of these [counteragents) the state [is then explained].	1
And since the result is constituted by the state, immediately after the state comes the result in order to generate skill in that.	1
The supremacy of the vehicle is explained at the end because this whole [sequential progression takes place] owing to the universal vehicle.	1

The Imagination of What is Unreal.	1
a.	1
The Characteristic of Existence and Non- Existence.	1
Therein, concerning the characteristic, he says: I.1 abcd There is the imagination of what is unreal; the duality is not found therein; but here emptiness is found and the former is found in the latter.	0
In this [verse], the imagination of what is unreal refers to the con- ceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and the apprehending subject.	1
The duality refers to the apprehended object and the appre- hending subject.	1
Emptiness is the absence of apprehended object and apprehending subject on the part of that unreal imagination.	1
When he says: "and the former is found in the latter", ["the former" refers to the imagination of what is unreal.	1
Thus, the characteristic of emptiness which is not erroneously inverted is shown by this quotation5¹: "One perceives [phenomena] as they are in reality by realizing that where something is non-existent, it is empty of that, and furthermore one correctly comprehends [phenomenal as they are in reality by realizing that what is left as a remainder in this respect does really exist here".	1
Therefore all is established as neither empty nor not empty, because of existence, non-existence and again existence; and this is the middle way.	1
[All] is neither empty of emptiness and unreal imagination, nor not empty of the duality of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
called 'the imagination of what is unreal', and the unconditioned [phenomena] which are called 'emptiness'.	1
The term "is established" [means] "is explained".	1
Because of the existence of: unreal imagin-	1

existence of emptiness in the imagination of what is unreal and [the existence of the imagination of the unreal in the former.	1
Moreover, this is the middle way.	1
All [phenomenal are neither absolutely empty nor are they absolutely not empty.	1
Thus, this passage in the Prajñāpāramitās etc.	1
: "all this is neither empty nor not empty", is in agreement.	1
[Sthiramati] Therein, concerning the characteristic, he says: I.1 abcd There is the imagination of what is unreal; the duality is not found therein; but here emptiness is found, and the former is found in the latter.	0
seven subjects mentioned above, such as the characteristic and obscuration, he says: "[there is] the imagination of what is unreal"52.	1
Considering that the explanation com- plies with the way [the subjects] are listed and the characteristic was listed firstly, hence, the explanation of just that [subject] is undertaken initially rather than the other [subjects).	1
[2] Some believe53 that all dharmas are devoid of own-being in every respect, like horns on a hare, hence, in order to refute their total negation he says: "there is the imagination of what is unreal"; the ellipsis here is: "by way of own-being".	1
[Objection]: Is it not so that such a statement is at variance with the Sutras because it is said in a Sūtra: "all dharmas are empty"?	1
[Response]: There is no contradiction because: "therein the duality is not found".	1
For the imagination of what is unreal is described as empty, i.e.	1
as devoid of the essential nature of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, but not as devoid of own-being in every respect; consequently, it is not at variance with the Sūtras.	1
[Objection]: If the duality is thus non-existent in every respect, like horns on a hare, and unreal imagination does exist by way of own-	1
not so because: "but here emptiness is found".	1
For, since this is the very emptiness which consists in the absence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject in the imagination of what is unreal, emptiness is not non-existent.	1
If emptiness is free	1

liberated; and if it were something existing, why is it not apprehended?54 order to remove such a doubt, he says: "and the former is found in the latter"; because the imagination of what is unreal is found in emptiness too, therefore one is not [already] liberated.	1
And this is why [emptiness] cannot be perceived, like the clear water element [cannot be perceived], because it is accompanied by stain.	1
[3] Alternatively, in order to refute that [false] view of those who believe that mind, the mental concomitants and also form exist substantially55, he says: "there is the imagination of what is unreal".	1
The latter certainly exists substantially but form does not exist separately from it; (form] does not exist substantially.	1
What is the reason?	1
Because: "the duality is not found therein"; for, the imagination of the unreal is not the apprehending of something nor is it apprehended by anyone.	1
What is then?	1
It is just a 'bare' existent devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
For thus, form and the like are not apprehended externally to consciousness; consciousness arises in the appearance of form etc., like in dreams etc., and if it has a cause, its arising in the absence of one is not tenable.	1
Therefore it is devoid of an objective support, just as in dreams and the like; elsewhere too it is to be concluded that consciousness is pro- duced in the appearance of the object due to the maturation of an individual 'seed'.	1
The existence of the apprehending subject is not tenable if the apprehended object does not exist because, if the apprehended object does not exist, the apprehending subject [too] does not exist 56.	0
Therefore, form does not exist separately from unreal imagination.	1
[Objection]: If the apprehended object does not exist, there can be no liberation because of the absence of an objective support of purity.	1
[Response]: This is not so because:	1
emptiness is the objective support of purity57 and since it exists as an absence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject in the imagination of what is unreal, liberation is not non-existent.	1
[Objection]: If it exists and is present in unreal imagina- tion, what is the reason that it is not apprehended?	1
[Response]: It is not apprehended because it is obscured by unreal imagination, like the stainlessness 58 of space [is not apprehended] but not because it does not exist.	0
In order to illustrate this point he says: "and the former is found in the latter".	1

Defilement has the imagination of what is unreal for its own-being because it is characterized by error.	1
How should the fact that it is characterized by error be understood?	1
Because: "the duality is not found therein".	1
It is known to have an essential nature that consists in error because it manifests in the aspect of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
purification, he says: "but here emptiness is found"; for the own-being of emptiness is purification because its own-being consists in the non-existence of the duality.	1
And in this context, the inclusion of both the path and cessation should be understood because they are constituted by emptiness.	1
In order to demonstrate that the side of purification is to be sought from the side of defilement and the individual continuum does not exist separately 64, he says: "here".	1
The question arises: if the duality does not exist, how can	1
what is unreal"; considering that it is not entirely non-existent, nor does it have the nature of an existent since it exists in the nature of the transformation of consciousness.	1
However, there are those who believe that form etc.	1
exists, by way of own-being, in exactly that way in which they manifest, i.e.	1
as separate from unreal imagination.	1
With regard to such [people] and in order to refute imputation in regard to what is unreal 59, he says: "the duality is not found therein".	1
The intended meaning is that there is just 'bare' unreal imagination.	1
The non-existence of the duality 60 is apprehended by some	1
infertile woman.	1
The absence of an internally active being is said to be fequivalent to] the emptiness of the dharmas by others.	1
Hence, in order to refute the negation of emptiness, and in order to reveal insubstantiality in reality, he says: "but here emptiness is found".	1
[Objection]: If emptiness exists in the imagination of what is unreal, then all living beings would be liberated effortlessly.	1
[Response]: This is not so because: "and the former is found in the latter"; since there is no liberation in an emptiness that has not been purified and [emptiness) that has been defiled62 is purified by a mighty effort, thus there is no liberation without effort.	1

; the apprehending subject, to eye consciousness etc.	1
For, emptiness is the absence 67, or devoidedness, of the apprehended object and apprehending subject on the part of the imagination of what is unreal, however the imagination of what is unreal itself is not non-existent; just as a rope is empty of the own-being of a snake 68 because never at any time does it possess such an own-being, but it is not that a rope69 is empty of own-being.	1
It is the same in this respect [i.e.	1
unreal imagination is not empty of own-being].	1
When he says: "the former is found in the latter", ["the former" refers to] the imagination of what is unreal; for thus it has been described as not apprehended because it is defiled by adventitious obscuration, like the [clarity of the] water-element etc.	1
Thus... "one perceives [phenomenal... by realizing that where the world be in error if that [emptiness] exists?	1
Hence he says: "and the former is found in the latter".	1
[6] There the conceptual differentiation65 of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, just like the aspects etc.	1
of elephants (which are imagined] in a magical creation that is empty of the aspects of elephants etc.66 It is the imagin- ation of what is unreal (abhūtaparikalpa) since the duality which is unreal (abhūta) is imagined (parikalpyate) in it, or by it.	1
By the word "unreal" he demonstrates that this [phenomenal world] does not exist in the way in which it is imagined, i.e.	1
as the [dichotomy of] apprehended object and apprehending subject.	0
By the word "imagination" he demonstrates that the way in which an object is imagined [qua exist- ent object], it does not exist as such.	1
Thus the characteristic of this [unreal imagin- ation] is revealed as being quite devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending	1
and the future, which consist in cause and result, which pertain to the three realms of existence, which exist from time immemorial, which end in nirvana and which are in conformity with samsāra, are, without exception, unreal imagination; but especially it refers to the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
Therein the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object refers to consciousness with its appearances as objects and sentient beings.	1
The conceptual differentiation of the apprehending subject refers to the appearances as the self and	1

What does not exist in what?	1
The duality [does not exist] in the imagination of the unreal; consequently, one sees that the imagination of the unreal is empty of the duality; and furthermore what is left as a remainder in this respect does really exist here...".	0
Just what is left as a remainder here?	1
The imagination of the unreal and emptiness since both of these exist herein, seeing without superimposition and negation, one correctly comprehends [phenomena] as they are in reality.	1
It is free from superimpo- sition in this regard because one sees the absence of the duality in the imagination of the unreal; and it is free from negation because one sees the existence of both the imagination of the unreal and emptiness.	1
The characteristic of emptiness, which is not erroneously inverted, is shown...; because of the actual existence of that which is empty and because of the non-existence therein of that which it is empty of.	1
If on the one hand all [dharmas] exist or on the other, all were non-existent, the characteristic of emptiness would not be non-erroneously inverted because this would lead to the non-existence of emptiness itself.	1
If that which is called 'empty' were non-existent, emptiness would not be tenable, because real nature (dharmată) is depen- dent upon something existent, like the impermanence [of what impermanent] etc.	1
If the duality did exist, emptiness would not exist.	1
[Objection]: If [the non-existence of] the duality is just like the [absolute non-existence of the hors of a hare?	0

Similarly, the imagination of the unreal too, which manifests in the aspect of the apprehended object and apprehending subject which are non-existent in themselves, is described as empty 75 of the duality in order to induce naive people to abandon their attachment to such a notion76.	1

[9] And this is the middle way, i.e.	1
that which is taught in the Ratnakūṭa and other works85: For what reason was this verse composed?	1
In order to show that all conditioned and unconditioned [dharmas] are devoid of the duality77.	0
For thus 78, by rejecting absolute- ness the intended meaning of the quotation from the Prajñāpäramitās is made	1
would be an inconsistency between the former and the latter.	1
Furthermore, [this verse was composed] in order to demonstrate the middle way; otherwise it would lead to the extremes of that which is absolutely empty on the one hand; and that which is not empty on the other, Alternatively, it was composed to sum up the refutation of both negation and imputation.	1
The imagination of what is unreal is conditioned because it	1
unconditioned because it does not depend on these.	1
"Is established" [means] is	1
the nature of the imagination of the unreal.	1
Because of non-existence, i.e.	1
of the duality it is empty of the nature of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
And because of existence, i.e.	1
of emptiness in the imagination of what is unreal83, considering that that [emptiness] is the real nature of the latter; the imagin- ation of the unreal is found in emptiness too in the nature of the possessor of that dharma.	0
Similarly, even what is unconditioned is not empty of the nature of real nature but is described as a non-existent insofar as it is empty of a nature that consists in the	1
"To say it exists, O Kāśyapa, this86 is one extreme and to say it does not exist is a second extreme; that which lies between these two extremes is described as the middle way, O Kaśyapa, since it consists in the investigation of the reality of the dharmas.	1

The Individual Characteristic.	1
Thus, having stated both the characteristic of existence and the char- acteristic of non-existence on the part of the imagination of the unreal, he states the individual characteristic: I.3 abcd Consciousness comes into being in the appearances as objects, sentient beings, the self and representations,	0
Due to the non-existence of the latter, the former too does not exist.	1
The appearance as object therein refers to that which appears as an entity of form etc.	1
The appearance as sentient being refers to that which [appears] as the five sense-faculties within one's own and others' mental continuum.	1
The appearance as self refers to the defiled mind because this is associated with delusion about the self etc.	1
The appear- ance as representations refers to the six consciousnesses.	1
"Although its object does not exist" because the appearances as objects and sentient beings is without aspect, and because the appearances as self and repre- sentations are false appearances.	1
"Due to the non-existence of the latter, the former too does not exist" because of the non-existence of the latter, i.e.	1
the fourfold object to be apprehended, namely, form etc., the five sense faculties, mind and the six consciousnesses, the former too does not exist, i.e.	1
the apprehending consciousness.	1
I.4 abc Consequently, it has been proven that the imagination of what is unreal pertains to this [consciousness];	0
89 Read: sarvanästitve sarvästitve as per Ms.(5a.8) in place of sarvanästitvam sarvästitvam.Y16.5	0
is it non-existent in every respect.	1
Because it does not exist in that way in which it arises as an appear- ance, nor is it non-existent in every respect because of the production of 'bare' error.	1
What is the reason then that its definite non-existence is not accepted?	1
Because... Liberation is considered as being due to its extinction.	1
Otherwise there would be the fault of the negation of defilement and purification since neither bondage nor liberation could be established.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] Thus, having stated both the characteristic of existence and the char- acteristic of non-existence on the part of the imagination of what is unreal...; the characteristic of its existence is existence itself since this is characterized by existence; what is meant is: he demonstrates the existence of the imagination of what is unreal by this statement: "there is the imagination of what is unreal".	1
Similarly, the characteristic of its non-existence is non-existence itself since this is characterized by non-existence.	1
Furthermore, this refers to that which does not exist as the appre- hended object and apprehending subject; because the duality does ot exist in unreal imagination therefore it is said that unreal imagination too does not exist in the nature of the duality.	1
Now he states the individual characteristic.	1
What is the differ- ence between the characteristic of existence and the individual characteristic?	1
The char- acteristic of existence is a universal, but the individual characteristic is a particular.	1
What would be the consequence if the individual characteristic were not stated here?	1
The 'body' of the imagination of what is unreal would not be mentioned, hence, in order to clearly illustrate its 'body' it is said: I.3 abcd Consciousness comes into being in the appearances as objects, sentient beings, the self and representations,	0
Due to the non-existence of the latter, the former too does not exist.	1
Alternatively, it is not known how the sense faculties, sense-objects and consciousness are established in relation to that 'bare' imagination of the unreal referred to above as the existence of just the 'bare' imagination of the unreal devoid of the apprehended objectY17 and apprehending subject 90; thus in order to show that they are established in relation to that according to their differentiation as the appearances of the imagination of the unreal, he states the individual characteristic of the imagination of the unreal: "in the	0
[3] Alternatively, by the [words] "there is the imagination of what is unreal", its 'bare' existence is made known92 but not its own-being; and if the duality is non-existent, the reason for the notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject	1
duality does not exist, hence in order to clearly illustrate this, he says: "in the appear- ances as objects, sentient beings, the self and representations".	0
In this regard, the imagi- nation of the unreal is the own-being of consciousness, and consciousness together with its associated elements is intended here 93, but it is chiefly consciousness itself that is referred to.	1
The ground for that notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject is the appearances as objects and sentient beings etc.94.	1
"Although its object does not exist.	1
Due to the non-existence of the latter, the former too does not exist"- this is the reason why the duality is non-existent.	1
The appearances as objects and sentient beings therein refers to the store-consciousness together with its associates; and the latter is definitely undefined because it is the karma-result.	1
The appearance as the self refers to defiled mind together with its associated elements; and that is described as obscured and undefined because it is associated with moral defile- ment.	1
The appearances as mental representations refers to the group of the six begin- ning with eye-consciousness together with their associates; these are wholesome, unwholesome and undefined.	1
In this way, these eight consciousnesses, together with their associated elements, come forth in the appearances as objects, sentient beings, self and representations in the five respective states of existence, from the store-conscious- ness which depends upon co-operating conditions and which incorporates the [noble] truth of the arising (of suffering].	1
There is a certain 'special transformation' of the latent impressions of the wholesome, unwholesome and undefined dharmas in the store-consciousness and through the influence of that, consciousness comes into being	1

[Consciousness) appears in the nature of form, sound, odour, taste, contact and non-sensibles because it arises in such an aspect.	1
The appearance as sentient beings refers to that which [appears] as the five sense faculties within one's own and others' mental continuum96; the term: "appears" is understood 97.	0
With regard to the five sense faculties, there is the appella- tion sattva because it is the locus of excessive attachment (sakti); it is sentient being (sattva) since it is attached (sajjate) by, or to, these [sense faculties].	1
Because it arises in such an aspect, consciousness possesses that particular appearance.	1
The appear- ance as self refers to defiled mind because that is associated with delusion about self etc.98; because defiled mind is always 99 associated with delusion about self, the false view of self, the craving for selfi00 and self conceit.	1
Since these [four] have the self for their objective support it is proper¹01 that the appearance as the self pertains to defiled mind.	1
The appearance as representa- tions refer to the six consciousnesses.	1
The appearance as representations [occurs] on account of the arising of the aspects of those [consciousnesses] through	1
[5] "Although its object does not exist", i.e.	1
[the object which arises] in these four aspects, because the appearances as objects and sentient beings are without aspect, and because the appearances as self and representations are false appearances.	1
Since the appearances as objects and sentient beings mani- fest in the nature of the apprehended object, the reason for the non-existence of the	1

as objects that exist separately from consciousness, like the 'hair-nets' seen by a person with impaired eyesight.	1
Therefore, in order to induce them to abandon their attachment to those [objects etc.]	1
it is said: "this is just consciousness that arises in the appearances of objects etc.	1
although devoid of objects and sentient beings etc., just as there is the appearance of 'hair-nets' etc.	1
for those people who have ophthalmia".	0
Thus it is said that the other-dependent [nature] with its entities of the eight consciousnesses comprises the imagination of what is unreal.	1

false appearance.	1
However, because the other two [i.e.	1
self and representations} mani- fest in the nature of the apprehending subject, they are not without aspect and the reason given for the non-existence of the object [in these cases] is precisely that they consist in false appearances.	1
For the aspect is the mode of the 'taking hold' of the	1
the [former] two [i.e.	0
objects and sentient beings] because they manifest in the nature of the apprehended object.	1
Hence, "because it is without aspect" means: because there is no apprehender.	1
Alternatively, the aspect consists in the correct knowledge of the	1

which are well known both generally and exegetically, whence, after rejecting them, consciousness is perceived to have a nature that is not differentiated from them?	1

brought forth from an individual 'seed' each one appropriated 103 by each particular determin- ation of the mental continuum, although the essential nature of the different objects does not exist.	1
Thus for example, the pretas see [a river] filled with pus, excrement and urine etc.	1
guarded on both sides of the river by men with sticks in their hands 104; however, humans and the like perceive it as filled with pure, clear water and as quite inoffensive 105.	0
Also, the ascetics, who practice mental attention in regard to impure things etc., see the ground completely covered by skeletons; and likewise, in regard to [all the topics of contemplation] such as [the element] 'earth', they see everything pervaded by earth etc.	1
Moreover, the generation 106 of a consciousness which possesses a nature that depends upon an object is not tenable without that object, nor [is the generation of a consciousness tenable] whose aspects are different from the essential nature of the object.	1
Therefore it is ascertained that it is just consciousness	1

[the existence of such an object.	1
[7] Both the appearances as the self and representations are false appearances because they manifest in the aspect of the apprehending subject although the apprehended object does not exist.	1
Alternatively, the object does not exist in that way in which it is imaginatively constructed by consciousness; it is a false appearance because it is a false objective support, just as when sounds etc.	1
[are imagined as the roaring] of tigers etc.	1
Similarly, it is an established fact that mental representations too are devoid of a nature that is imaginatively constructed 108 by another representation.	1
Hence the object of the appearances as the self and representations also does not exist, just like [the objects) of the appearances as objects and sentient beings109.	1
Because of the non-existence of the ...object, ...the former too does not exist, i.e.	1
consciousness...; it is described as consciousness (vijñāna) since it discerns (vijānāti)110.	0
If the appre- hended object does not exist, the [existence of the discerning agent is not tenable.	1
Therefore, due to the non-existence of the object, consciousness does not exist as a discerning agent; but not so [regarding consciousness] in the appearances of objects, sentient beings, the self and representations, for, if the latter were non-existent it would result in total non-existence since there can be no explanation for the essential nature of consciousness apart from this.	1
If its essential nature were different from this how would [the existence] of that consciousness be tenable?	1
How could one be differen- tiated from the other?	1
[8] Thus, because of the non-existence of the apprehended object and the appre- hending subject and due to the actual existence of consciousness in the appearance of the latter, that which was asserted previously, i.e.	1
"there is the imagination what is unreal; the duality is not found therein", has been established.	1
In order to demonstrate this, he says: 1.4ab Consequently it has been proven that the imagination of what is unreal pertains to this [consciousness];	0

By "consequently", is meant: by reason of what was just stated, i.e.	1

existence of the duality, he says: Because it does not exist as such, nor is it non-existent in every respect	1
order to demonstrate just this, he says: "because it does not exist as such, nor is it non- existent in every respect."	1
Because it does not exist as such and because it is not non- existent in every respect [consciousness] arises in the appearance of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
Although, in this regard, there are four modes [of appearance], there is no apprehending subject because [the first two modes] are with- out aspect and because [the latter two] are false appearances, respectively.	1
Furthermore, there is no apprehended object because all [four modes] are devoid of a nature that is imaginatively constructed113 by another representation.	1
Nor is it non- existent in every respect because of the production of 'bare' errori14; that which appears in an aspect, although non-existent in itself115, is described as "error"; it is like a magical creation.	1
The word "bare" has the sense of the exclusion of what is additional to it.	1
This is what is being said: because of the actual existence of consciousness that consists in error, [consciousness] is not non-existent in every respect.	1
[9] What then is the reason that the definite non-existence of that consciousness that consists in error is not accepted, like the non-existence¹16 of the apprehended object and apprehending subject [is accepted]?	1
If [such a question] implies that its existence is unable to be imagined by anyone since it transcends the domain of all consciousnesses, [the answer is] because... Liberation is considered as being due to its extinction ¹17.	0
Hence its definite non-existence is not accepted; on the contrary, its existence is inferred because of its capacity (as a basis] for the sides of defilement and purification.	1
Otherwise, if its definite non-existence in every respect is accepted, there would be neither bondage nor liberation 118.	0
If 'bare' error also did not exist, bondage too would	1

considering that it is from a previous state of bondage that one is released.	1
[10] Alternatively, in order to exclude other interpretations which beg the questions: "why is [consciousness that consists in error] not considered as existent in that way in which it manifests 119, or else, as non-existent in every respect?	1
He says: "liberation considered as being due to its extinction" 120; what is meant is: when that is not com- pletely extinguished¹21 there is bondage.	0
This is what is being said: 122 otherwise there would bel23 the fault of the negation of defilement and purifi- cation 124 since neither bondage nor liberation [could be established].	1
If [phenomena] were to exist absolutely in exactly that way in which they appear as the apprehended object and apprehending subject for [all beings] from cattle upwards¹25,	1
Similarly, if 'bare' error were also non-existent, there would be no defilement, and purification would be eternal.	1
Thus in both cases, the effort of those who seek libera- tion would be in vain and consequently, the existence of the imagination of what is unreal should necessarily be admitted as well as the non-existence of the duality.	1
Having thus stated the individual characteristic of the imagination of what is unreal, he states the characteristic of the totality, i.e., the way in which there is a totality of the three natures when there is the 'bare' imagination of what is unreal.	1

is unreal consists in the other-dependent nature; the non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject consists in the perfected nature.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] He states the characteristic of the totality.	1
The term samgraha-lakṣaṇam may be resolved as a karmadhāraya compound, i.e.	1
]: the totality itself is the character- istic, or (as a tatpuruşa]: the characteristic of the totality, i.e.	1
that by which the totality is characterized.	1
And why is it mentioned?	1
Because it was stated in the above that there exists just the 'bare' imagination of what is unreal devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
Furthermore, the three natures are taught in other Sutras, hence, in order to demonstrate that there is no contradiction with other Sütras, their totality is described here.	1
This is why the author of the commentary says: ...when there is	0
1.5 abcd The imaginary, the other-dependent and indeed the perfected are taught on account of the object, the imagin- ation of what is unreal and the non- existence	0
[respectively].	1
Although both the apprehended object and apprehending subject¹27 are unreal because they are empty of own-being, on account of the fact that the latter is imagined to exist, it is described as imaginary ¹28.	1
Moreover, although this does not exist substantially, [the imaginary] is described as a 'nature' since it exists in conventional expression.	1
The other-dependent [nature] is subject to others because its arising is dependent on causes and conditions.	1
It is said:	1

be stated with regard to the [other two statements from verse 1.5]: "on account of the imagination of what is unreal", and "on account of the non-existence of the duality".	1
[2] The object consists in the imaginary nature130; in this context131 the object refers to form etc., sight etc., self and representations; and since it is non-existent in the imagination of the unreal in a nature that is imaginary, being non-existent132, it is described as the imaginary nature.	1
It is said: Conceptual differentiation devoid of con- ceptual differentiation¹ 133 is imagined by another conceptual differentiation; its nature	1
tual differentiation, does not exist.	1
The imagination of what is unreal consists in the other-dependent nature; it is other-dependent since it depends on, or is produced by, other causes and conditions but does not exist in itself.	1
The non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject consists in the perfected nature; it is described as perfected because it is perfected insofar as it consists in both perfection devoid of change and perfection devoid of erroneous inversion.	1
[3] For, in this context, the absence of the duality on the part of the imagination of the unreal is described as the non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, but not merely the non-existence of the duality.	1
Thus, it is just the imagination of the unreal that is other-dependent because it depends upon causes and conditions.	1
The latter also is imaginary because it manifests in the natures of the apprehended object and apprehending subject which are non-existent in themselves.	1
The latter is also perfected because of its absence of the apprehended object and apprehending	1

is slightly different; cf.	0
Y's fns.3 & 4, p.23.Y23.19 [Sthiramati] [1] Since the characteristic of non-existence has not been clearly comprehended, the imagination of what is unreal leads to 135 the defilements of moral defilement, karma and rebirth.	0
Consequently, in order to clearly comprehend the characteristic of non- existence, and in order to demonstrate the expedient for that¹36, he says: Based upon perception etc.	1
1.6 a Since it is indicated implicitly within the imagination of the unreal, or rather since it is the imagination of the unreal, the characteristic of non-existence is that very non-exist- ence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject the entry into that is [equivalent to] its understanding.	0
The expedient for the latter is that through which one enters the characteristic of non-existence.	1
Moreover, this consists in a twofold skill, i.e.	1
a special basis 137 for the application to penetrate 138 the all-pervading sense of the dharmadhātu.	0
This verse was articulated in order to indicate [all] this implicitly.	1
[2] Based upon 139 the perception of representation-only, the non- perception of the object originates.	1
This absence of an objective support is the fact of representation-only; [consciousness] 140 arises in the appearance of form etc.	1
due to the maturation of the individual 'seed' However, since there is no object consisting in form etc., one thus enters the non-perception of the apprehended object based upon¹41 the perception of the apprehending subject.	1
[3] It should be deliberated upon in this way: consciousness 142, whether in the process of arising, or, already arisen, would depend upon a sense-object.	1
In this respect, to depend upon a sense-object while in the process of arising is not tenable because [consciousness] does not [yet] exist when it is in the process of arising.	1
Nor does it exist when it has already arisen because it arises in the nature of the appearance of a sense-object; and since there is no other activity143 on the part of consciousness with the exception of its arising in the nature of the appearance of the sense-object, it is said that consciousness depends upon the sense-object while performing144 that activity.	1
[4] Alternatively, if the functioning of the objective support [occurs when conscious- ness is already present and not when it is in the process of arising, then consciousness does not arise 145 with the objective support for its causal condition.	1

annul the theory of momentariness146, and in the absence of an exceptional nature, like in the latter case, the 'seizing' of the objective support by consciousness is not tenable.	0
Or else ¹47, it is considered to have an exceptional nature at the time of the 'seizing' of the objective support even so, due to the observation of an exceptional nature only in the other case, it is concluded that [consciousness] 'seizes' only the other objective support that has already arisen.	1
[5] Another [school] believes that only the object that ceases to exist [from moment to moment] is the causal condition that is the objective support for consciousness while in the process of arising and that this is distinguished from the [three] other causal condi- tions by the fact that it is the cause of consciousness148 in the appearance of individual aspects.	0
Thereby, either atoms of form etc., or a collection of them, is imagined to be the objective support although, in both cases, the objective support does not exist	1
the appearances of atoms.	1
Moreover, consciousness appearing as one thing in the aspect of the object cannot have an objective support which is different 149, since even sight and the other [sense faculties] would be objective supports.	1
Moreover, one may believe that an accumulation of atoms forms the objective support but the individual [atoms] do not this is also a non-argument, for although they may be accumulated they can only be considered as objective supports individually not as an accumu- lation.	0
With regard to the latter [view], consciousness 150 does not arise in the indi- vidual appearances of atoms, for [it arises] in the appearance of an accumulation of them; therefore the notion] that atoms form an objective support is not possible.	0
Nor is the objective support a collection of atoms because causality is not possible on the part of that which has [only] nominal existence, because like the immediately preced- ing-causal condition etc.	1
151, the objective support-causal condition is also considered to be the cause of consciousness.	1
Therefore, it is not possible that something that ceases to exist [from moment to moment] can be the objective support-causal condition ¹52.	1
Likewise, if that which has actually ceased to exist forms the objective support¹53, this	1

that consciousness is devoid of the sense-object in dreams etc.	1
[6] Some believe 154 that the consciousness in dreams etc.	1
is not without an objective support because it has the sign (nimitta) for its objective support.	1
But, the sign is the reflected image of the object which has the dissociated formative forces for its own- being, for if the object does not exist in dreams etc., [the existence of its sign is not tenable, like in the absence of a face etc., its reflection cannot be established 155.	1
[Response]: Consciousness, whether in the process of arising or already arisen, does not have the sign for its objective support because both its non-existence and cessation have already been described.	1
Consciousness itself consists in the reflection of the object because of the fact that it is an appearance of the object, hence it is not tenable that the sign has the nature of the dissociated 156 formative forces.	1
Moreover, consciousness is to be admitted necessarily as possessing the aspect of the object, for if it were without aspect, one could not determine the apprehended object and appre- hending subject.	1
[7] However, others believe that non-resistant [i.e.	1
transparent] matter forms the objective support in a dream and in the [meditative contemplation] of ascetics upon impure things etc.	0
; but [the notion that] the latter are non-resistant and belong to the domain of mind alone is contradicted by the fact that they have colour and shape etc.	0
Also, non-resistant matter other than mere non-information (avijñapti) is not taught in the sästras; therefore this is no more than a hypothesis.	1
[8] Others again consider that the object of past experience forms the sense-object of consciousness in a dream because there is no perception of the colour blue etc.	1
in dreams for one who is born blind.	1
[Response]: It is not that one who is blind from birth does not perceive colour in dreams, rather, because [the object's] conventional symbol has not been explained to him, he does not know it by name and hence cannot communicate it to others.	0
Moreover, if it is only what has been experienced [in the past] that one sees in a dream, then why is it not considered that one who is blind from birth also does not see colour, for colour certainly was perceived by such a person in previous lives¹57?	1
Also, it is not that only what is perceived in the present life appears in a dream, for there no distinction whatever between one who sleeps and one who is awake in relation to past, future and present experience.	1
Therefore, it is purely hypothetical to assert that consciousness ¹58 has an object of past experience as its	1

certain that consciousness, although devoid of a sense-object, arises in the appearance of the object in a dream.	1
Thus, [the notion of] the non-perception of the sense-object is cultivated because its perception [occurs] as a mental representation-only.	1
[9] Based upon the non-perception of the object 59, the non-perception of representation-only originates as well.	1
Just as one enters the non-existence of the apprehended object¹60 through the force of representation-only, since the imagi- nary apprehended object does not exist externally to consciousness; similarly, one understands the non-existence of representation-only too through the force of the non- existence of the apprehended object.	1
It is not tenable that the apprehending subject exists if the apprehended object does not exist because the determination of the subjectivity of that is dependent upon objectivity.	1
In this way, one enters the characteristic of the non-existence of the apprehended object and appre- hending subject which have an imaginary nature; however, [the entry into the characteristic of the non-existence] of the imagination of what is unreal has not been shown¹61.	1
[10] What then is the reason that just the non-existence of representation-only was not determined 162 from the very beginning?	1
[Response]: Because the apprehending subject is dependent upon the apprehended object when the object to be supported does not exist one easily enters [the non-existence of representation-only] due to the destruction of the entity which has the nature of the objective support163.	0
Otherwise there would be a definite negation 164 of existence because the apprehended object and apprehending subject would be devoid of the relation of mutual dependence.	1
At the conclusion of the first immeasurable aeon [the bodhisattva), progressing without inter- ruption in the accumulations [of merit and direct intuition] enters this level of direct intuition which transcends the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object¹65 and apprehending subject.	1

[11] In order to demonstrate the fact that perception has non-perception for its own- being, he says: 1.7 ab Consequently, it is proven that the own-being of perception is non- perception;	1
Alternatively, that which was previously asserted, that the duality does not exist in the imagination of what is unreal, has been proven because it is introspectively knowable in this aspect.	1
It is in order to demonstrate this that he says: "consequently, it is proven that the own-being of perception is non-perception".	1
Consequently, i.e.	1
because there can be no perception if there is no object to be perceived 170.	0

tion".	0
This is why the author of the commentary says: because, in the absence of the object to be perceived, perception is not tenable.	1
Therefore, it should be known that non-perception and perception are equivalent.	1
Since perception has non-perception for its own-being, therefore they are the same; i.e.	1
the fact that they are equivalent should be known because there is no difference insofar as there is neither the non-perception of the object nor is there perception consisting in	1

nothing is perceived by that [perception] because of the absence of the object, hence, there is no contradiction in an absolute sense because he says: ...although having	1
[13] Others say that on the one hand there is the perception of the object173 by naive people, although there is no object, and on the other hand there is the non-perception of the object by the Noble Ones; both of these should be known to be the same because their characteristics are equivalent, like in the [perception and] non-perception of an erroneous snake.	1
This is why he says: "...but is described as perception insofar as it consists in the appearance of an unreal object, although having non-perception for its own-being 174", like in the statement about the non-perception of an erroneous snake.	1
[14] Others again say that on the one hand there is the perception of the apprehending subject by naive people; and on the other hand there is the non-perception of the appre- hending subject by the Noble Ones, because of the absence of the object.	1
Although in the two cases both perception and non-perception should be known to be the same	1
hended object.	1
This is why he says: "...insofar as it consists in the appearance of an unreal object".	1
[15] However, others believe that in order to counteract imputation and negation he says: "therefore, it should be known that non-perception and perception are equiva- lent", i.e.	1
because of the absence of the object and since perception175 does not have the essential nature of perception, it is described as not having such an essential nature.	1
[Response]: [The notion] that perception has perception for its essential nature is not excluded 176, nor is it interpolated that it has non-perception for its essential nature.	0
177 What is it then?	1
Both of them are the same owing to the absence of conceptual differ- entiation.	1
Therefore, regardless of imputation and negation, the fact that there is intro- spective equality on the part of both non-perception and perception should be known.	1

[Sthiramati] Y29.14 [1] He states the characteristic of the differentiation.	0
There are various modes of differentiation of the imagination of the unreal as being of the nature of ¹81 the realms of sense-desire, form and formlessness.	1
Since the differentiation itself is the characteristic, it is the characteristic of the differentiation [i.e.	1
the term prabheda- lakṣaṇam is a karmadhāraya compound] because the imagination of the unreal is char- acterized by this differentiation ¹82.	1
What is the reason that the characteristic of the differentiation is declared?	1
Because the (existence of the] realms of sense-desire and form is not tenable if there is just the imagination of what is unreal.	1
[If] the differen- tiation of Noble Ones and ordinary people etc.	0
is not made according to the differen- tiation183 of realms of existence as the result of the differences in the adverse elements	1

f. The Characteristic of its Synonyms.	0
He states the characteristic of the synonyms: 1.8 cd Vision in regard to the object con- sists in consciousness, but in regard to its particulars, it consists in the	0
Therein, vision in regard to the object alone consists in conscious- ness; vision in regard to the particulars of the object consists in the mental concomitants, such as sensation.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] He states the characteristic of the synonyms194.	1
By demonstrating the particulars as belonging to the mind and the mental concomitants 195, he states the char- acteristic of the synonyms of the imagination of what is unreal.	1
How so?	1
Because the mind and the mental concomitants manifest as imaginative constructions in regard to	1

Since the vision197 of an object's essential nature and particulars consists in both the mental concomitants and unreal imagination they are included as synonyms, however, the particular does not exist in the object.	1
[2] Therein, the vision in regard to the object alone198 consists in con- sciousness.	1
The word 'alone' is for the purpose of excluding the particulars 199; what is meant is: the perception of just the essential nature of an entity the particulars are not 'seized'.	1
Vision in regard to the particulars of the object200 consists in the mental concomitants, such as sensation; because they function with regard to that [i.e.	1
the object]201 in various particular forms.	0
In this regard, the particulars of joyfulness or sorrow can pertain to an entity and the 'seizing' of the condition of well- being etc.	1
belonging to that is 'sensation' (vedana).	1
The particular of an object is the sign202 which consists in a conventional expression, such as 'man' or 'woman' and its apprehension is 'ideation' (samjña).	1
The other respective [mental concomitants) should also be construed in this way.	1
Thus these203 are associated by having the same nature in regard to (a) basis, (b) objective support, (c) time and (d) substance, but not by	1
from consciousness.	1
[3] Some [schools] understand that it is just the special modes of mind (cittaviseșa) that are intended as the mental concomitants in this context and that same conscious- ness arises in variegated appearances, like the eyes on a peacock's tail, in forms etc.	1
that are similar204.	0
[Objection]: How can it be both singular and variegated since, with regard to a singular entity 205, the world does not accept a variety of [incompatible]206 characteristics?	1
Otherwise it would be said that a singular entity has a manifold own- being.	1
[Response]: This fault would apply if the own-being of a dharma were per- fected, but this fault does not relate to 'bare' error because of the statement: "because it does not exist as such, nor is it non-existent in every respect"; (I.4 c).	0
[Objection]: This is not so because it contradicts this statement from a Sutra: "these dharmas known as sensation (vedanā), ideation (samjñā), mind (citta) and consciousness (vijñāna) are mixed together they are not discrete; and close-contact (samsarga) indeed belongs to	0

g. The Actualizing Characteristic.	0
Next he states the actualizing characteristic: 1.9 abcd The first is consciousness as causal condition; the second pertains to sense-experience; the mental con- comitants therein are sense-experi- ence, discrimination and stimulation.	0
Consciousness as causal condition is the store-consciousness since	1
causal condition.	1
Sense-experience refers to sensation.	1
Discrimination refers to ideation.	1
The stimulations refer to the formative forces of consciousness volition and mental attention etc.	1
[Sthiramati] Y32.10 [1] In order to demonstrate that when there is the 'bare' imagination of the unreal and nothing else, its differentiation as cause and result is not discerned, [hence] he states the actualizing characteristic.	1
It is a characteristic since the imagination of the unreal [is characterized] as cause and result on account of this.	1
[Since] the actualizing itself is the characteristic, it is the actualizing characteristic [i.e.	1
the term pravṛtti- lakṣaṇam is a karmadhāraya compound).	1
Furthermore, this actualization209 is twofold: (a) the actualization as a regular succession of momentary instants under the influence of which there is the defilement of sense-experience in the present lifetime and (b) the actualization as another rebirth under the influence of which there is the defilement of moral defilement, karma and rebirth, in the future.	1
The actualization as a regular succession of momentary instants in this context is described as the actualizing charac- teristic.	1
The actualization as another rebirth will be stated as the characteristic of defilement [in the next section].	1

the basic causal condition (hetupratyaya), of the remaining seven consciousnesses, it is consciousness as causal condition.	1
1.9 b The second pertains to sense- experience.	0
The word "consciousness" remains in force [from the preceding sentence].	1
The ellipsis is: it is the result of the latter [i.e.	1
the store-consciousness]; moreover, it is sevenfold.	1
The actual consciousness pertains to sense-experience because it has sense- experiencing for its purpose.	1
1.9 cd The mental concomitants therein are sense-experience, discrimination and stimulation.211 It is the fact that the mental concomitants therein, i.e.	0
in consciousness, are also the result of that [store-consciousness) that is referred to because they are [constituents of] consciousness and because they share its attainments and protection as one.	1
[2] Consciousness as causal condition is the store-consciousness since it is the basic causal condition for the other consciousnesses212.	1
It is [described as] a store-house (ālaya) since, in its mode as result, all impure213 dharmas are collected (aliyante) there, and, in its mode as cause, it collects in them.	1
It is con- sciousness because it causes the representation of the world of sentient beings and inanimate things through appearing as such; moreover, because it consists exclusively in the karma result, it is undefined.	1
It is consciousness as causal condition since it is the basic causal condition for both the 'seeds' of all impure dharmas that follow in consequence of it214 and for the other actual consciousnesses.	1
Actual conscious- ness, which pertains to sense-experience, has the latter for its causal condition; what is meant is: since it arises (pratyeti) from that store-consciousness, it is produced with the latter for its causal condition (tatpratyaya).	1
How does arise?	1
The actual consciousness, while in the process of manifesting from the store- consciousness, fosters in that store-consciousness a 'seed' which is the progenitor of an actual consciousness which has not yet arisen and which is of the same genre.	1

Thus, that actual consciousness216 has that [store-consciousness] for its causal condition²17.	0
[3] [Objection]: Is it not so that218 the store-consciousness also pertains to sense- experience, and the actual consciousness can be [construed as the consciousness as causal condition because [the store-consciousness] is the basis of the sense-experience of non-painful and non-pleasurable sensations and also because the latent impressions are activated219 in the store-consciousness?	1
There is no other activation of the latent impressions 220	1
Abhidharmasutra:221 All dharmas are collected in consciousness,	1
[Response]: It need not lead to this conclusion.	1
Why?222 Because of the difficulty in distinguishing the sensation that belongs to it, [the store-consciousness] is not recog- nized as being pertinent to sense-experience, like actual consciousness is, or it should be known as something pre-eminent, like the sun.	1
Accordingly, only actual consciousness is the basis for the sense-experience of the three kinds of sensation - the store-consciousness is not.	1
Moreover, in this context [the store consciousness] is intended as the basic causal condition, not just a causal condition.	0
Likewise, under the influence of wholesome and unwholesome dharmas, the store consciousness incor- porates the latent impressions consisting in both the karma-result and the natural outcome-result, whereas 223, under the influence of the undefined dharmas (it incor- porates] only the latent impressions that belong to the natural outcome-result.	1
Hence the store consciousness is the basic causal condition for all impure dharmas in their entirety.	1
However, actual consciousness is the predominant causal condition for the store consciousness it is not the basic causal condition224.	0
Thus, that the actual consciousness is a causal condition is not a [wrong) conclusion.	1

Sensation is like the essence of the flavour of existence.	1
Due to the latter, naive people are attached to sense-objects226 for the sake of the full sensory experience of them.	1
Others believe that sense-experience refers not just to sensation but also to the perception of objects, but this is not so because it is in contradiction with [Vasubandhu's] commentary which states: "sense-experience refers to sensation".	0
Moreover, since the perception of an object is not different from consciousness, it would not be logically tenable227 that it can be a mental concomitant.	1
The discrimi- nation of what has been sensed refers to ideation, because it consists in the appre- hension of the particulars, such as what is pleasurable.	1
The stimulations towards sense-experience and ideation refer to the formative forces of conscious- ness 228, volition and mental attention etc.	1
[5] Alternatively, he says: "sense-experience refers to sensation", because one experi- ences an objective support according to its nature; and because one experiences the karma of what is to be sensed as pleasure etc.	1
Thus229, since sensation consists in the sensory experience of both sense-objects and their karma, it is sense-experience.	1
Discrimination refers to ideation since it discriminates the mark (cihna) of the sense- object, i.e.	1
its conventional sign (vyavahära-nimitta).	0
The stimulations towards differ- ent objective supports on the part of consciousness are the formative forces 230; hence, through the influence of volition etc., consciousness partakes of a different objective	1

In the above: (a) it is due to concealing, because of the obstruction of [one's] vision [of phenomena] as they are in reality, by ignorance.	0
(b) It is due to implanting, because of the establishment of the latent impressions of karma in consciousness, by the formative forces.	1
(c) It is due to conducting, because it is made to reach the place of rebirth, by consciousness.	1
(d) It is due to encapsulating, of the individual nature by name form.	1
(e) It is due to completing, by the six sense-fields.	1
(f) It is due to threefold discriminating, by contact.	1

defilement [manifests] from the imagination of what is unreal.	1
Defilement is threefold: the defilement of moral defilement, the defilement of karma and the defilement of rebirth.	1
Of these, the defile- ment of moral defilement consists in ignorance, craving and grasping.	1
The defilement of karma consists in the formative forces and becoming.	1
The defilement of rebirth consists in the remaining [seven] elements.	1
Defilement is twofold: defilement as cause and defilement as result.	1
Of these, the defilement as cause includes those elements which have moral defilement and karma for their own-being.	1
Defilement as result includes the remaining [elements].Y35.6 Sevenfold defilement refers to the seven types of causes: (a) the cause of erroneous inversion, (b) the cause of projection, (c) the cause of leading, (d) the cause of possession, (e) the cause of sense-experi- ence, (f) the cause of attraction and (g) the cause of anxiety233.	1
Of these, the cause of erroneous inversion is ignorance.	1
The cause of projection is the formative forces.	1
The cause of leading is conscious- ness.	1
The cause of possession is name / form and the six sense-fields.	1
The cause of sense-experience is contact and sensation.	1
The cause of attraction is craving, grasping and becoming.	1
The cause of anxiety is birth, old-age and death.	1
And all of these defilements manifest from the imagination of what is unreal.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] Now he states the characteristic234 of defilement.	1
The characteristic of defilement refers to that mode in which the defilements of moral defilement, karma and rebirth, while in the process of manifesting, lead to the complete defilement of the world.	1
Although it is insubstantial 235, samsāra is generated just from the imagination of what is unreal.	1
In order to demonstrate this it is stated: I.10 ab Due to: (a) concealing, (b) implant- ing, (c) conducting, .	0
(d) encapsulat- ing etc.	1
These twelve elements of dependent origination are shown with reference to 236 the	1
[2] In the above, it is due to concealing, ...that the world is defiled; the latter portion of this statement [i.e.	1
"the world is defiled"] refers to all [twelve elements].	1
How is it that [the world] is defiled due to concealing and by what is it con- cealed?	1
Hence he says: because of the obstruction of [one's] vision [of phenomena] as they are in reality, by ignorance.	1
Since ignorance237 consists in the absence of vision, when the sphere of one's vision of reality is hidden, the vision of what is real does not arise.	1
Consequently, because it obstructs the arising of one's vision of the real, ignorance is an obstruction to [the arising of the vision of what is real; furthermore, the vision of the real consists chiefly in supramundane wisdom.	1
The latter, which is subsequently attained because it arises subsequently [to the path of vision] and which consists in learning, reflection and meditative development which	1

Because it obstructs the vision of what is real, ignorance is described as the causal condition for the formative forces, thus it is said: "due to concealing by ignorance, the world is defiled".	1
[3] It is due to implanting; that the world is defiled - this is understood.	1
As to the agent, locus and object of implanting, he says: of the latent impressions of karma in consciousness, by the formative forces.	1
Therein, the formative forces consist in karma of body, speech and mind and its essential nature can be vir- tuous, non-virtuous or neutral.	1
It is a formative force (samskāra) since it formatively influences (abhisamskaroti) the new existence; what meant is: it implants what was not previously implanted 239; it is just this [sense that is expressed by the term "formative force", but not all [its meanings].	1
Moreover, since they have the capacity to project the new existence because of the influence of ignorance240 and not merely on account of their existence, it is said that the formative forces have ignorance for their causal condition.	1
Accordingly, they bring about the new existence for one whose knowledge 241 has not yet arisen, but not for one whose knowledge has arisen.	1
Ignor- ance is not described as the causal condition for the formative forces merely as the predominant [causal condition] because it is the general causal condition in the manifestation [of the new existence] as well, for ignorance is likewise associated with all moral defilement.	0
Just as it is the causal condition in general for the arising of the moral defilements that do arise242, so too is it (the causal condition] for the volitions which arise243 from the latter.	1
Even when the [meritorious 1244 formative forces mani- fest, i.e.	1
those that follow as a consequence of the genuine wish for245 the special states of existence and enjoyments, ignorance which is innate to them246, is their general causal condition.	1
Also, [when there is the arising] of neutral247 [formative forces] that arise 248 with the notion that one can escape to those levels 249, ignorance, which is	1

condition for the formative forces.	1
In the above, the store-consciousness is intended by the term: "consciousness", and not the actual consciousness because of the impossi- bility of being conveyed to the place of rebirth by the actual consciousness whose continuity is interrupted 252, and also because the latent impressions of karma are not established therein by the formative forces since both the wholesome and defiled [dharmas] cannot be brought together.	1
When [Vasubandhu] says: "[it is due to the implanting] of the latent impressions of karma...", just what is this that is described as the latent impression of karma?	0
It is the 'seed' of the future birth253, i.e.	1
a causal entity.	1
For example, a grain of rice is the seed, i.e.	1
the causal entity, for the arising of a sprout [which develops] through a transformation in dependence upon special conditions such as soil, ash and manure.	1
Because of the establishment...; this term expresses implanting again through a different synonym.	1
Furthermore, "establishment" in this context refers to the augmentation of that 'seed' in the continuum of consciousness from the very beginning254, by these [formative forces]; for, no previously non- existent 'seed' of any dharma that is accompanied by impurity is generated, like in the case of one without impurity.	1
In this way, the world is defiled due to the generation of the 'seed' of the new existence in consciousness, by the formative forces.	1
[4] It is due to conducting; that the world is defiled.	1
Since the agent, locus and object of conducting is not discerned, he says:.	1
because it is made to reach255 the place of rebirth256, by consciousness.	1
Conducting refers to the conveying of the latent impressions of the 'seed' of the new existence, from the place of death to the place of rebirth, by consciousness which is fully developed by karma and which functions as a continuum 257.	1
After considering it in this way258, then the conscious- ness at conception cannot have the formative forces for its causal condition; and it has been demonstrated that only the consciousness belonging to the previous existence has the formative forces for its causal condition, because the arising of an effect from a cause that has perished is not tenable.	1
Since those who have gained the formless attainments are reborn in that very place where they die, how can they be conveyed to a place of rebirth in the formless [realms]?	1
[Rather] it should be understood according to the circumstances, as is the case with name / form.	1

de Itar byas na (D207a.7).Y38 [5] It is due to encapsulating259; that the world is defiled.	0
As to the agent, locus 260 and object of encapsulation261, he says: of the individual nature, by name form.	1
Because name / form are [equivalent to the five aggregates.	1
The	1
stages of embryonic development262, and before the six sense-fields have arisen,	1
differentiation into different homogeneous groups is accomplished through a special activation within that [name / form].	1
And when the latter have arisen, their individual nature is differentiated due to the difference in homogeneous groups, such as between human and animal; thus it is said that the individual nature is encapsulated by name / form.	1
Alternatively, it envelops the whole individual nature up until death263 because the whole is determined as a causal state from the beginning.	1
Or else, although it is not differentiated264, the individual nature is enveloped by name / form, thus he shows it to be separate; just as everything conditioned is included in the five aggregates [yet are separate from them]; however, only 265 the sense-fields of creatures of miraculous birth (aupapăduka) have consciousness for their causal condition266 (and not name / form].	0
Consequently, it should be known that name / form have consciousness for their causal condition, according to the circumstances.	1
and object of completion, he says: of the individual nature which is included in name / form 269, by the six sense-fields.	0
For the individual nature 270 is described as incomplete in the state of name form because of the absence of the sense-fields of sight etc.	1
Moreover, although the tactile and mind sense-fields do exist in that state, they too are definitely incomplete because as a ['field' comprising] both that which is based [i.e.	0
the object of the senses] and the basis [i.e.	1
the sense organs], it is incom- plete.	1
Furthermore, the basis271 is complete in the state of the six sense-fields because of the actualization of sight etc.	1
The tactile sense-field is also complete because of the	1

Because their functioning depends upon it.	1
The mind sense-field too, which is included in the six consciousnesses, is completed at this time because of the completion of the basis 274 in its entirety.	1
Also, since the major and minor members [of the body] are complete 275 only in the state of the six sense-fields276 because the basis is complete, it is said that the world is defiled by the six sense-fields.	1
[7] It is due to threefold discriminating; "that the world is defiled” is under- stood.	1
"Threefold" refers to the combination of sense faculty, sense-object and consciousness.	1
Contact refers to the discrimination of the three modes of modifi- cation of the sense faculty and is conducive to the arising of the sensation of pleasure etc.	1
It is described as contact (sparśa) since it is an aspect of that likeness of modifi- cation of the sense faculty which it touches (sprșati)277.	1
Alternatively, contact which has the six sense-fields for its causal condition, produces a threefold modification of the sense faculty that is conducive to the sensation of pleasure etc.	1
[8] It is due to sense-experiencing278, through sensation; because sensation is experienced on account of craving; what is meant is: 'consumed with relish'.	1
Alter- natively, the sense-experience of sensation is due to the experience of karma279 that is virtuous etc.	1
Alternatively, in this context sense-experience refers to the experience of a sensation and when pleasure etc.	1
is experienced, due to the full development therein of [sensations] such as pleasure, the world is defiled by [subsequent] passion, hatred and delusion.	1
[9] It is due to the attracting; since the agent and object of attraction are not discerned, he says: of the new existence projected through karma, by crav- ing; i.e.	1
[the attraction] of the new existence projected due to the maturation of its 'seed' on account of the formative forces in consciousness, by craving, which can be likened to the moisture 280 [in the generation of a seed].	1

Thus, the karma performed in the past is the cause of consciousness and	1
existence since the 'fruit' of the karma-result acquires a functional status and is directed towards accomplishing the projection of an existence288.	0
Thus the world is defiled due to directing289, by becoming.	1
[10] It is due to the fettering; when questioned as to the agent, locus and object of fettering, [Vasubandhu] himself says: of consciousness to the sense-desires etc.	1
that are conducive to rebirth282, through the graspings.	1
Conscious- ness, which is projected by karma by means of the four graspings that are char- acterized by notional attachment 283 and the passion of sense-desire, is fettered to, i.e.	1
fixed in284 sense-desire, false view, morality and observances and false view of self285 which are conducive to rebirth because consciousness abides therein [in the new birth] by force of the passion of sense-desire286, [12] It is due to suffering that the world is completely defiled by birth, old-age and death 290.	1
Thus, when there is the actualization of the new existence due to becoming, from the very outset [the world] is defiled as the consequence of the coagulation of consciousness in semen and blood at the time of impregnation.	1
Similarly, it is defiled due to the to-and-fro movement [of the foetus] midway between the stomach and the abdomen of the mother.	1
Similarly, it is defiled because of the mother's inability to dispel anxiety and anguish when eating and moving about.	1

5 & 7.Y41 [13] Since it is in motion (gacchati), it is [described as] the 'moving', [i.e.	1
the world] (jagat); what is meant is: it progresses from an homogeneous condition to a momentary condition.	0
By "it is defiled" is meant; in [all] the three realms of existence, [the world] is afflicted on account of birth, old-age, sickness and death etc.	1
and on account of its incessant motion through a regular succession of moments.	1
Others believe that the term "it is defiled" means: 'it is not purified'.	1
Thus, these twelve elements of dependent origination which are characterized by defilement, arise on account of these eleven modes beginning with "due to concealing" as the direct counterpart to purification; and, beginning with ignorance, they form a sequential progression, since each subsequent element is brought about by each preceding element.	1
Similarly, the world291 is defiled by coming out292 [of the womb] through a restricted and impure passage.	0
Again, the world is defiled insofar as one is born only to be deprived of293 cherished youth and vitality by old-age characterized by baldness and grey hair etc.294 and by death which is characterized by the dissolution295 of name / form.	1
[14] How many kinds of defilement have been demonstrated in total through these twelve elements of dependent origination?	1
Hence he says:296 these twelve elements of dependent origination are: I.11 cd The word "and" has a conjunctive and repetitive298 sense.	1
Since moral defilement itself is defilement, it is described as the defilement of moral defilement.	1
Similarly are the defilements that consist in karma and rebirth [so-called], for moral defilement manifests as defilement [in general] because it is harmful to both oneself and others; as is said in a Sutra: "one who is enamoured 299 and overcome with passion is intent upon harming himself, is intent upon harming others and is intent upon harm in both (this and the	1
"300 And it is defilement because the defilements that consist in karma and rebirth are generated; accordingly, the karma projects the rebirth under the influence of moral defilement.	1

the bond of conception in a new existence for one whose mind is defiled, the defile- ment that consists in rebirth is a cause [for the defilement of the world].	1
Consequently, since the Arhat does not possess a defiled mind, there is no bond of conception.	1
Moreover, karma whether pure or impure is [equivalent to] defilement because it both causes bodily and mental fatigue in the present301 and provides the karma-result in the future.	1
Rebirth too is [equivalent to] defilement because it is the locus of all misfortune.	1
defilement of moral defilement consists in ignorance, craving and grasping302; the latter form a trio because they have the nature of moral defilement.	1
The defilement of karma consists in the formative forces and becoming; the latter form a pair because they have the nature of karma.	1
However, there is this difference: karma, in its state as essential nature consists in the formative forces, but in its state as 'seed' it consists in becoming.	1
The defilement of rebirth consists in the remaining [seven] elements, i.e.	1
consciousness, name form, the six sense- fields, contact, sensation, birth, old-age and death, since these are included within rebirth.	1
[16] Defilement is twofold, since the cause is not differentiated.	1
The defile- ment as cause includes those elements which have moral defilement and karma for their own-being303; defilement as result includes the remain- ing elements.	1
Of these, the defilement as cause304 is pertinent to karma and moral defilement because the latter are engaged in the generation of rebirth which: (a) begins with consciousness and concludes with sensation, (b) has the nature of birth and (c) possesses the distress of old-age and death³05.	1
Moreover, defilement as result includes the remaining elements beginning with consciousness, because they are the result of karma and moral defilement.	1
[17] Furthermore, that same process of dependent origination consists in a sevenfold defilement which refers to seven kinds of causes because they are the causes of: (a) erroneous inversion, (b) projection, (c) leading, (d) possession, (e) sense- experience, (f) attraction and (g) agitation.	1
Of these, the cause of erroneous inversion is ignorance, for one who has succumbed to ignorance erroneously inverts what is impermanent etc.	1
as being of the nature of something permanent etc.	1

forces, because they establish in consciousness the 'seed' of rebirth which consists in four of the elements (of dependent origination].	1
The cause of leading307 is con- sciousness, because it conveys one who has died here in this world to the place of rebirth.	1
The cause of possession is both name / form and the six sense- fields, because that which is led [i.e.	1
consciousness] possesses a (particular] homo- geneous grouping on account of name / form and the six sense-fields.	0
The possession just by name form was mentioned in the above where the womb of creatures born from a womb was intended.	1
Here, the possession by the six sense-fields as well is	1

its cause.	1
The cause of attraction is craving, grasping and becoming; a naive person whose karma-result has been experienced, craves for various feelings; when craving intensifies he clings to sense-desires etc.	1

As the consequence of the	1
the new existence and which is in a state of latent impression, is transformed.	1
This leads to the imparting of the karma-result, in accordance with what has been projected, then after being activated it is becoming'.	1
Moreover, that [karma] is attracted, i.e.	1
is directed 310 towards the actualization of the new existence projected by the formative forces on account of craving, grasping and becoming.	1
Alternatively, craving, grasping and becoming are the cause of attraction since they are directed towards one of the two latent impressions of karma conducive to the passion of sense-desire, on account of craving.	1
The cause of anxiety is birth, old-age and death; thus, here one experiences the pain of birth, old-age and death among the various classes of sentient beings because of the attraction of birth, as well as [experiencing] an endless variety of suffering that consists in sorrow, lamentation, depression and perturbation.	1
[18] In the above, moral defilement and karma311 are shown as general and specific causes [respectively] of rebirth, through the description of threefold defilement.	0
Moral defilement is the general cause [in the germination] of the 'sprout' of rebirth, just as soil is [for a plant]; however, karma is the specific cause, just as the seed is [the specific	1

differentiation in that [karma).	1
Alternatively, although there are not three separate segments that comprise the past, present and future in this regard (i.e.	1
dependent orig- ination], he nevertheless demonstrates that it does consist in karma, moral defilement and their result.	0
[19] Through the statement about twofold312 [defilement] he demonstrates that this 313 is merely cause and result and that no other agent of action nor agent of sensation is defiled in this regard.	1
Alternatively, the cause refers just to karma and moral defile- ment in this context because it is seen that the presence or absence of rebirth is due to the presence or absence of these two [i.e.	1
karma and moral defilement]; hence, rebirth is indeed the result of them.	1
Therefore, he demonstrates that there is neither cause nor result in this regard, but in every case [i.e.	1
in each of the twelve elements] there is a state possessing the five aggregates.	1
[20] Furthermore, two kinds of dependent origination have been demonstrated through the explanation of the sevenfold causes, namely: that characterized by project- ion and that characterized by actualization.	1
Of these, that characterized by projection has been explained through the seven elements of dependent origination by demon- strating: (a) thet by which it is projected, (b) the way in which it is projected and (c) that which is projected.	1
That which is characterized by actualization [has been explained] through the five [remaining] elements [by demonstrating]: (a) that by which there is the actualization of what has been projected, (b) the way in which it actualizes and (c) the actualization (itself], as well as the distress [implicit] therein.	1
What is the agent of projection?	1
The formative forces which have ignorance for their causal con- dition.	1
How so?	1
After becoming acquainted with erroneous inversion due to delusion about reality 314, [ignorance] formatively influences the wholesome, unwholesome and neutral formative forces.	1
How is it projected by those formative forces?	1
They establish it in the appropriate place315 of rebirth due to the development of the 'seeds' in consciousness.	1
What is projected?	1
All that pertains to the new existence, i.e.	1
name / form, the six sense-fields, contact and sensation, respectively.	1
By what means is there the actualization of that which is projected in this way?	1
As has been said, [it is actual- ized] in stages from what was previously projected through grasping which has for its causal condition that craving which has already arisen in dependence upon the sensation that has arisen in the present lifetime.	1
How is it actualized through this [grasping]?	1
The karma which is in the state of latent impression within consciousness is caused to come into being through that [grasping], for many kinds of latent	1

[To recapitulate], the summary meaning of the imagination of what is unreal is revealed as consisting in nine types of characteristic: (a) the characteristic of existence, (b) the characteristic of non-existence, (c) the individual characteristic, (d) the characteristic of the totality, (e) the characteristic of the expedient for entry into the characteristic of non- existence, (f) the characteristic of the differentiation, (g) the character- istic of the synonyms, (h) the actualizing characteristic and (i) the char- acteristic of defilement.	1
[Sthiramati] [To recapitulate], the summary meaning of the imagination of what is unreal...; the explanation of the meaning in detail is for the purpose of reaching an understanding with ease.	1
Whereas the explanation of the summary meaning is for the purpose of remembering it.	1
Consequently, both meanings are stated here: (a) The characteristic of existence: "there is the imagination of what is unreal" (I.1 a).	1
(b) The characteristic of non-existence: "the duality is not found therein" (I.1 b).	1
(c) The individual characteristic: "consciousness comes into being in the appearances of objects, sentient beings, the self and representations" (1.3 ab).	1
(d) The characteristic of the totality: "the imaginary, the other-dependent and indeed the perfected" (1.5 ab).	1
(e) The characteristic of the expedient for entry into the characteristic of non-existence: "based upon perception, non-perception comes into being" (1.6 ab).	1
(f) The characteristic of the differentiation: "the imagina- tion of what is unreal consists in the mind and the mental concomitants that pertain to the three realms of existence" (I.8 ab).	1
(g) The characteristic of the synonyms: "therein, vision in regard to the object consists in consciousness, but in regard to particulars, it consists in the mental concomitants" (1.8 cd).	1
(h) The actualizing characteristic: "the first is consciousness as causal condition, the second pertains to sense-experience" (1.9 ab).	1
(i) the characteristic of defilement: "due to conceal- ing, implanting, conducting, encapsulating..." (1.10 ab) etc.N22.17 Having thus stated the	1

[Sthiramati] Y45.15 [1] Having stated the ninefold characteristics of the imagination of what is unreal, he now explains the manner in which emptiness should be understood322.	1
What is the relation here [between them]?	1
The two were introduced by him [i.e.	1
Vasubandhu] as: (a) the imagination of the unreal and emptiness; and (b) purification which is preceded by defilement and the correct determination of real nature (dharmata) which has for its basis an understanding of the dharmas.	0
Hence, immediately following the explanation of the imagination of the unreal, he explains the manner in which emptiness should be understood.	1

Moreover, its differentiation is sixteenfold accord- ing to the imputative differences in regard to the personal entity (pudgala) and the dharmas.	1

What then is the reason that emptiness should be understood by way of these modes?	1
It should be understood: (a) by way of the char-	1

(c) When the meaning of its synonyms is understood328 [it should be understood] by way of the meaning of its synonyms329 because emptiness is ascertained as the objective support of purity.	1
(d) Since it is purified when defilement is removed [it should be understood] by way of its differentiation in order to generate diligence for the relin- quishment of 330 that defilement.	1
(e) It should also be understood by way of the logical proof of its differentiation since, although there is no modification, its differentiation is easily understood due to an awareness of the logical proof of its differentiation.	1

The Characteristic of Emptiness.	1
How should the characteristic be understood?	1
I.13 ab The non-existence of the duality, which consists in the existence of a non-existent, is the characteristic of emptiness;	1
apprehending subject.	1
The existence of that non-existent is the charac- teristic of emptiness.	1
Thus it has been revealed that emptiness has the characteristic of the own-being of a non-existent.	1
Moreover, this own- being of that non-existent, it:	1

Because there is the non-existence of the duality.	1
How can it be not non-existent?	1
Because there is the exist- ence of the non-existence of the duality.	1
And this is the characteristic of emptiness.	1
Therefore, in relation to unreal imagination: 1.13 d The characteristic consists neither in difference nor identity.	1
If there were difference, real nature (dharmata) would be something other than a dharma, like the impermanence and painfulness [of some- thing impermanent and painful], which is not tenable.	1
If there were identity, there would not be an objective support of purity, [consisting in direct intuition]331, nor would there be a universal characteristic.	1
In this way, its characteristic has been revealed as being devoid of identity and difference.	1
[Sthiramati] Y46.17 [1] How should the characteristic be understood?	0
Since the characteristic was listed initially 332, hence it is that which is queried from the very beginning.	1
I.13 ab The non-existence of the duality, which consists in the existence of a non-existent, is the characteristic of emptiness333.	1
Thus should it be understood.	1
There is the non-existence, in the nature of an entity, of the duality of apprehended object and apprehending subject, because its nature is imaginatively constructed either in the imagination of what is unreal, or by the imagination of what is unreal.	1
This existence of that non-exist- ent duality is the characteristic of emptiness.	1
Owing to the rules of prosody in the above verse, the abstract suffix334 [i.e.	1
the tã of śünyatā] is to be regarded as expressed although omitted.	0
What is meant by "the existence of a non-existent"?	1
The nature of a non-existent is existence, otherwise, because its non-existence would not exist as an [empty] existent3³35, there would be the existence of the existent duality.	1
This is why he says: Thus it has been revealed that emptiness has the char-	1

the nature of an existent.	1
[Objection]: The word "existence" is superfluous here because this meaning is understood as being implicit in the word "non-existence" even if the word "existence" is omitted, since it is a statement about the denial of existence.	1
[Response]: It is not superfluous.	1
If it were only stated that "the non-existence of the duality is the characteristic of emptiness", one would understand 337 the non-existence of the duality as just an independent reality, like the non-existence of the horns of a hare, and not the fact that it consists in real nature, like the painfulness etc.	1
[of some- thing painful].	1
Therefore the non-existence of the duality is thus described as empti- ness and the existence of its non-existence in the imagination of what is unreal is also described as emptiness.	1
The fact that [emptiness] has the nature of real nature is demonstrated because it is included as the characteristic of the existence of a non- existent.	1
[2] Alternatively, since the word "non-existence" in the statement "the non-existence of the duality is emptiness" has only general significance, it cannot be discerned here which non-existence is intended.	1
Thus in order to demonstrate its absolute non-exist- ence it is said: "there is the existence of the non-existence of the duality in the imagina- tion of what is unreal", for antecedent non-existence [i.e.	1
before coming into being] and subsequent non-existence [i.e.	1
after passing from being] cannot be spoken of other than as self-appropriation ³38.	0
Moreover, reciprocal non-existence, i.e.	1
as having a single basis, is not tenable because [separate] basis is required in both cases.	0
There- fore, because it appropriates the characteristic of the non-existence of an existent, it has been shown that it indeed the absolute non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject that is [equivalent to] emptiness.	1
[3] If emptiness has the nature of non-existence, how can it be described as the absolute?	1
Because it is the object of the highest direct intuition, like the impermanence [of what is impermanent], but not because it is an entity.	1
Moreover, this does not have a non-existent own-being, because this own-being of that non-existent, it339: I.13 c Neither exists nor does it not exist;	1
duality, for if it were an existent there would not be the absolute non-existence of the duality 340, nor would there be the real nature of the imagination of what is unreal.	1

If it were that non-existent, the duality would exist and there would not be the real nature of the imagination of what is unreal; and, by analogy; [there would be no] imperma- nence and painfulness [of what is impermanent and painful].	1
It is said to be neither existent nor non-existent because it has the nature of the non-existence of a permanent and pleasurable entity which is imputed through erroneous inversion on the part of sentient beings.	1
[4] If the emptiness of the imagination of what is unreal is real nature, 342should this	1
says: and this 343 is the characteristic of emptiness; i.e.	1
it is the very own-being of non-existence 344.	0
Alternatively, existence itself has the nature of the denial of non- existence.	1
Therefore, in relation to unreal imagination: 1.13 d The characteristic consists neither in difference nor identity.	1
If there were difference, real nature (dharmata) would be something other than a dharma which is not tenable.	1
Why is it not tenable?	1
Because if its characteristic were different from a dharma, real nature would in fact be another dharma, like any dharma other than it; however, one dharma cannot be the real nature of another dharma because, in that case, another dharma would have to be sought [to account for real nature] and there would be an infinite regress.	1
Like the imperma- nence and painfulness (of something impermanent and painful]; i.e., just as impermanence is not other than what is impermanent and painfulness [is not other} than what is painful 345, so too is emptiness not other than what is empty.	1
If there were identity, there would not be an objective support of purity, nor would there be a universal characteristic.	1
Since one is purified by it, the path is purity 346.	0
The path would not be an objective support, like the individual char- acteristic of a dharma, because there would be no difference from the individual char- acteristic of that dharma.	1
Therefore, since it would not be different from the individual characteristic, the universal characteristic would not be tenable.	1
Also, since it can be differentiated from something else, just as the essential nature of one dharma [can be differentiated from another], universality is lost.	1
Alternatively, because the individual characteristic would not be different from this [universal characteristic] there would be	1

Alternatively, an objective support of purity is an objective support for purification; and the individual characteristic of something, if it is taken as [an objective] support, does not bring purity because all sentient beings would already be purified.	1
the imagination of what is unreal], why is the doctrine of the Nirgrantha not given credence?	1
Because one who believes in the Nirgrantha doctrine does not make a distinction in regard to the difference or identity of something that truly exists ³49.	1
However, since emptiness is not an existent, there is no fault here.	1
[6] Thus emptiness is: (a) the characteristic of non-existence, (b) the characteristic of the essential nature of non-existence, (c) the characteristic of the absence of the duality and (d) its characteristic has been revealed as being devoid of identity and difference.	1
The characteristic of emptiness has now been described.	1

It is thusness in the sense of immutability, considering that it is eternally just thus.	1
It is the limit of what is real in the sense of the	1

It is signless in the sense of the cessation of signs because of the absence of all signs.	1
Because it is the sphere of the direct intuition of the Noble Ones, it is the absolute for it is the domain of the highest direct intuition.	1

It is thusness in the sense of immutability.	1
What is meant is: in the sense of	1

What is meant is: it is unchanging because it is unconditioned always, i.e.	1
at all times 355.	0
It is the limit of what is real in the sense of the freedom from erroneous inversion; the real means: the true and non-erroneously	1
Hence the limit of what is real356 is described as the extremity of what is real.	1
How can thusness be described as the extremity of the knowable?357 Because it is the sphere of direct intuition that is purified 358 from obscuration consisting in the know- able.	1
The words: "in the sense of the freedom from erroneous inversion" are equiva- lent to: 'in the sense of the freedom from superimposition and negation'.	1
Here now he gives the reason: because there is no foundation for erroneous inversion.	1
Erroneous inversion is [equivalent to] conceptual differentiation; [emptiness] is not a foundation 359 for erroneous inversion because it is not an objective support for conceptual differentiation.	1
It is signless in the sense of the cessation of signs360.	1
Signlessness, in this context, is described as the cessation of signs.	1
In order to demonstrate just this, he says: because of the absence of all signs.	1
Since emptiness is empty of all signs, both conditioned and unconditioned, it is described as signless.	1
It is signless because of the non-existence of all signs; only that which is without signs361 is signless.	1

Therefore, it is not impermanent.	1
For example, elementary water, gold and space do not possess stain for their own-being because they do not have such an own-being; both when possessing adventitious stain and also when adventitious stain is removed,	1
is defiled by adventitious stain and is purified as the result of the removal of that, although its own-being is unchanged.	1
For, he who determines the one and the same entity initially as having the characteristic of defilement and subsequently as having purity for its own-being, does not [avoid the conclusion] that a dharma which is modified is destroyed due to a modification in its own-being.	1
However, this is not so when both [i.e.	0

tence of their non-existence in that	1
The non-existence of the personal entity and the dharmas is one	1
mentioned enjoyer etc.	1
is another emptiness.	1
In order to state the char- acteristic of emptiness he respectively determines emptiness as twofold at the end, [namely], the emptiness of non-existence and the emptiness of the own-being of non-existence for the purpose of avoiding impu- tation in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas and the negation of their emptiness, in due order.	1
The differentiation of emptiness should be understood in this way.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] Since all differentiations of emptiness should be described in the section that explains its differentiation376, he says this is another differentiation: the six- teen types of emptiness.	1
It is sixteenfold according to its differentiation in relation to [various] entities, however, there is no differentiation in regard to its own-	1
in the Prajñāpāramitãs as emptiness, beginning with internal emptiness and concluding	0
brief as: The emptiness of the foundation for:	1
these and (d) the support etc.	1
Emptiness is a universal characteristic because all dharmas have the essential nature of the non-existence of the duality.	1
Since it is not possible to show its multiplicity in any other way, he shows its multiplicity by way of its multiple foundations.	1
1.17 ab [2] From the very beginning, the enjoyer is to be annihilated [through clear under- standing]377 in order to abandon one's affection and notional attachment to it; for this affection and notional attachment are impediments to the attainment of liberation and Buddhahood.	0
Immediately after that, the enjoyment belonging to that [enjoyer] [is to be annihilated].	1
Immediately after that, the physical body which is the locus of both of these [is to be annihilated].	1
Then, the inanimate world, i.e.	1
the support for the physical body which is the locus for both [the enjoyer and the enjoyment] is to be annihilated [through clear understanding] in order to destroy the grasping of and affection for [the inanimate world] as belonging to the self because it is of service to the enjoyer.	1
These are the four types of foundation - the emptiness of these is described as the emptiness of the foundation.	1
[3] Of these, the emptiness of the enjoyer refers to the internal sense- fields 378, beginning with 'sight' up until 'mind'.	1
Because there is no agent of enjoy- ment apart from these and because they see the eyes etc.	1
as active in the sense-	1
regard to sight and the other [senses]; therefore the emptiness of the sense-fields of sight etc.	1
is described as the emptiness of the enjoyer.	1
[4] The emptiness of enjoyment [refers to the external [sense-fields] ³79;	0
entities of the sensory domain, they are [described as] enjoyments (bhojana).	0
Hence the emptiness of the external sense-fields is described as the emptiness of enjoyment.	1
[5] The body belonging to those is the physical body because both the enjoyer and the enjoyment are established as mutually inseparable [entities]380 in vibhāvayitavyaḥ; Tib.	0

[6] The foundation for the support refers to the inanimate world; because it is perceived as the foundation for the support of sentient beings in every respect³82 This is why he says: the emptiness of that is described as universal empti- ness because of its extensiveness.	1
The word "foundation" is connected individually [with each of the four categories discussed].	1
[7] To that bodhisattva-yogi who is mentally attentive, through proper mental attention	1
that are to be known, a different 'sign-grasping' becomes evident, [namely] - that knowledge of emptiness through which this [entity] consisting in the internal and external sense-fields etc.	1
is seen to be empty384.	0
There is [a twofold] con- ceptual differentiation: (a) the notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject and (b) just this here is an aspect of the absolute according to	1
[through clear understanding] of these two modes of conceptual differentiation which have the sign of error pertinent to the spiritual level of the yogi, (a) the emptiness of emptiness and (b) the emptiness of the absolute [are indicated], respectively.	0
These are indicated, bearing in mind that the words "knowledge" and "aspect" are [respectively] omitted 385 [i.e.	1
the full expressions would be śünyatā(jñāna)śūnyatā and paramärtha(ākāra)śünyata.	0
Alternatively, that knowledge is described as emptiness³86 because it has emptiness for its object.	1
The emptiness, of the existence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, of that is the emptiness of empti- ness.	1
Also, the way in which the latter, i.e.]	0
the internal sense-fields etc., are seen through that knowledge of emptiness as the absolute in this context the emptiness of that aspect is the emptiness of the absolute.	1
What is the reason?	1
Because the absolute is empty of the imaginary nature387.	0
[8] The other 'sign-grasping' [referred to above] is harmful to the meditative develop- ment of emptiness; the essential nature of an entity (bhāva) is imputed upon that for the sake of which the bodhisattva aspires388 to [the understanding of] empti- ness.	1

The words 396; "he does not throw away", express the same sense as "he does not dismiss".	1
If this is so, how then can the nirvana-realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence be proven?	1
It is an established fact that even in the nirvāṇa- realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence, there is no interruption to the Dharma Body belonging to the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, which is an entity free from impurity 397 because of the non-existence of the body which is the karma-result of the impure dharmas.	1
Hence, the emptiness of that is described as the emptiness of non-rejection.	1
And, for the purity of the spiritual lineage (gotra);	1
the spiritual lineage is intrinsic; how so?	1
he responds: since it derives from own-being 398.	0
That which derives from own-being exists from time immemorial; what is meant is: it is not adventitious.	1
In the same way that some [entities] in beginningless samsara are endowed with consciousness and some are non- conscious, similarly, in this regard some [beings] endowed with the six sense-fields belong to the spiritual lineage of the Buddhas and some belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävakas etc.	1
Since the spiritual lineage consists in a regular sequence [of rebirths] that is beginningless, it is not accidental like the difference between non- conscious and conscious [entities].	1
Others believe that since all sentient beings belong to the spiritual lineage of the tathāgata, the term "spiritual lineage" in this context should be understood accordingly 39⁹9.	1

The non-existence of the personal entity and the dharmas is one empti- ness and the actual existence of their non-existence in the above- mentioned enjoyer etc.	1
is another emptiness.	1
Of these, the non-existence of the personal entity and the dharmas is [equivalent to the emptiness of non-existence.	1
The actual existence of that non-existence is [equivalent to] the emptiness of own-being of non-existence.	1
405 For what reason are these two kinds of emptiness respectively determined at the end?406 Hence he responds: in order to state the characteristic of emptiness407.	1
Why is there a re-statement of emptiness?	1
Hence he says: for the purpose of avoiding both imputation in regard to the personal entity and	1
avoid imputation in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas, he determines the emptiness of non-existence; and in order to avoid negation in regard to the emptiness of the latter, [he determines] the emptiness of own-being of non-existence.	1

and the personal entity, whose essential nature is imaginary, do exist.	1
If the emptiness of own-being of non-existence were not mentioned, one may conclude that emptiness is indeed non-existent and as a consequence of the non-existence of the latter, the personal entity and the dharmas would exist like before.	1
[16] In the above, internal emptiness refers to: (a) the non-existence of: (i) the personal entity, i.e.	1
the 'enjoyer' and (ii) sight etc., whose characteristic is imagined, among the internal sense-fields which have the [karma-] result-consciousness [i.e.	1
the store- consciousness] for their own-being and are regarded by naive people as constituting an 'agent of enjoyment', and (b) the actual existence of the non-existence408 of the latter.	1
External emptiness refers to: (a) the non-existence of: (i) enjoyment that pertains to the self and (ii) form etc., whose characteristic is imagined, among the external sense-fields which have the appearances of representations of form etc.	1
for their own-being and are regarded by naive people as objects of enjoyment, and (b) the actual existence of the non-existence of the latter.	1
Internal and external emptiness refers to: (a) the non-exis- tence of: (i) a personal entity as 'enjoyer' in that body, i.e.	1
the physical body, (ii) form etc.	1
which is imaginatively constructed by naive folk and (iii) the body itself, and (b) the existence of the non-existence of the latter.	1
Universal emptiness refers to: (a) the non-existence of a world of sentient beings within the inanimate world, (b) the non- existence, by way of essential nature, of such an imaginative construction and (c) the actual existence of the non-existence of the latter.	1
In regard to both the knowledge of emptiness409 and an aspect of the absolute, the emptiness of emptiness and the empti- ness of the absolute refer respectively to the non-existence of: (a) the knowledge of emptiness, on the part of the knowing agent, which has the characteristic of an imagi- native construction and (b) the aspect of the absolute on the part of the personal entity who is the apprehender of the aspect410, and the actual existence of the non-existence of the latter.	1

These sixteen kinds of emptiness which pertain to the bodhisattvas and which are not common to the śrävakas have been explained in brief in order to counteract all grasping on account of conceptual differentiation, and also, in order to explain all hidden meanings of the Sūtras.	1
[17] And in this respect, the object of emptiness, the own-being of emptiness and the aim of the meditative development of emptiness have been shown by the Venerable One.	1
Of these, the object of emptiness refers to those subjects beginning with the	1
for the sake of showing that emptiness pervades all dharmas.	1
The own-being of emptiness refers to both the own-being of non-existence as well as the own-being of the existence of non-existence414.	1
Moreover, the demonstration of the own-being of emptiness is in order to show the nature of escape415 from all [false] views since it [acts as] counteragent to superimposition and negation.	1
The aim of the meditative development of emptiness begins with the [aspiration for the attainment of the dual virtues (cf.	1
I.	0
18a) and concludes with the [aspiration for the] attainment of the Buddha qualities (cf.	0
I.19cd).	0
Furthermore, the demonstration of the latter is in order to demonstrate that the culmination of the perfection of the Form and Dharma Body, for oneself and others, is due just to the meditative development of emptiness416.	0
The differentiation emptiness should be understood in this way; i.e.	1
it should be known that [emptiness] is defiled in the stained state and is purified in the stainless state; and it has a sixteenfold differentiation as just described, beginning with internal emptiness.	1

e. The Logical Proof of Emptiness.	1
How is its logical proof to be understood?	1
1.21 abcd If it were not defiled, all incarnate beings would be liberated.	0
If it were not pure, effort would be in vain.	1
If the emptiness of the dharmas were not defiled by adventitious secondary defilement, even when no counteragent has arisen, all sentient beings would be liberated without any effort at all because of the absence of defilement.	1
Now, even when the counteragent has arisen, should [emptiness] not become purified, undertakings for the sake of liberation would be in vain.	1
And so, after considering it in this	1
It is neither defiled nor is it unde- filed.	1
It is neither pure nor is it impure;	1
1.22 C How can it be neither undefiled nor pure?	1
1.22 d There is the luminosity of mind417;	0
defilement.	1
In this way, the differentiation of emptiness that was listed [above] is proven.	1
[Sthiramati] Y59.11 [1] Since its logical proof was listed immediately following the listing of the differen- tiation418, immediately after the explanation of that he asks: How is its logical proof to be understood?419 What is to be proven here?	1
The fact that: (a) it is defiled by adventitious secondary defilement and (b) it has purity of own-being.	1
In the above, with reference to the proof of the fact that it is defiled, he says:	1
(pp.9-10) to his Sanskrit edition.	0
419 Read: vijñeyam in place of jñeyam; cf.	0
Bhaşya N26.18.	0
1.21 ab If it were not defiled, all incarnate beings would be liberated420;	0
such defilement is due to the meditative development of the path.	1
In this respect, if the emptiness of the dharmas were not defiled by adventitious secondary defilement, even when no counteragent has arisen; the word "even" implies that like when it has arisen [it would not be defiled] - this being so, all sentient beings would be liberated without any effort at all421 because of the absence of defilement.	1
The words: "without effort"422 are [equivalent to] 'without a counteragent'.	1
However, since there can be no liberation for living beings without the counteragent, in the state of ordinary people the fact of defilement of thus- ness423	1
emptiness as defiled is proven in this way.	1
[2] Now, in order to prove the differentiation [of emptiness] as purified, he says: 1.21 cd If it were not pure, effort would be in vain424, It is [the effort] of incarnate beings that is referred to.	1
Now, even when the counteragent has arisen; the word "even" implies that like when it has not arisen [it would not become pure]; should [emptiness] not425 become purified; this being so, the undertakings for the sake of liberation would be in vain	1
such stain would not occur and also because liberation is not possible for one who possesses stain.	1
However, [the undertakings] for the sake of liberation are not consid- ered to be in vain; therefore, due to the practice of the counteragent, the purity of emptiness, through the separation from adventitious secondary defilement, must necessarily be admitted.	1
The differentiation of the purity of emptiness is proven in this way.	1
In this context, defilement is due to the appropriation of the dharmas that consti- tute defilement and purity is due to the appropriation of the dharmas that constitute purity.	1
However, neither defilement nor purity is considered to be manifestly present	1
says: "all incarnate beings would be liberated".	1

Otherwise, if defilement or purity were manifestly present for emptiness, then what connection would it have with incarnate beings, on account of which both the purity and defilement of the incarnate beings is described as being due to the purity of empti- ness and the defilement of emptiness, respectively?	1
And when emptiness is defiled in the state of ordinary people and is pure in the state of the Noble Ones this too427 has been proven: It is neither defiled nor is it unde- filed; it is neither pure nor is it impure.	1
42 How can it be neither defiled nor impure?429 It is definitely pure because this is made clear through the use of the double negative.	1
Here he quotes scriptural tra- dition: [Because] by way of intrinsic nature: 1.22 C There is the luminosity of mind;430	0
[phenomenal] mind is characterized by stain.431 How can it be neither undefiled nor pure?	1
On the contrary, the use of the double negative makes it clear that it is definitely defiled.	1
1.22 d 1.22 ab Because of the adventitious nature of defilement.	0
432 He shows that it is defiled but not intrinsically so433.	0
Scriptural tradition is also quoted here: "It is defiled by adventitious secondary defilement".	1
[4] When it has been differentiated as twofold, i.e.	1
as defiled and pure, why then is a fourfold differentiation mentioned?	1
Some say that it is in order to demonstrate 34 the distinction between the mundane path and the supramundane path, for, the mundane path is defiled by the stain pertinent to its own level but not by that which belongs to a lower [level] because [the former] is the counteragent to the latter.	1
The supramundane path is impure [in one sense] because it is differentiated as weak, middling etc., how- ever, it is pure due to the absence of impurity; but not so in the case of emptiness.	1
Again, after describing [emptiness] as undefiled, others describe it as not impure in order to distinguish it from the [sense-faculties] of sight etc., because sight etc.	1
are not	1

Thus, after describing it as undefiled, it is described as impure in order to distinguish it from wholesome [elements] which are accompanied by impurity because that which is wholesome and accompanied by impurity is not undefiled since it belongs to samsāra and is pure because it has an agreeable karma-result.	1
Real nature is definitely not so435, for, in the defiled state it is described as defiled and consequently as being impure.	1

Bhaşya N27.10.N27.12 The Summary Meaning of Emptiness.	0
Therein, the summary meaning of emptiness should be known both in terms of characteristic and establishment.	1
Of these, in terms of characteristic includes both the characteristic of non-existence and the characteristic of existence.	1
Furthermore, the characteristic of existence includes both the characteristic as devoid of existence and non-exis- tence and the characteristic as devoid of identity and difference.	1
Again, its establishment should be known in terms of the establishment of its synonyms etc.	1
In this regard, through these four modes of teaching: (a) the individual characteristic of emptiness, (b) the characteristic of karma [pertinent to its realization], (c) the characteristic of both its defilement and purification and (d) the characteristic of reasoning [pertinent to its proof] are made known these lead to the appeasement of: (a) conceptual differentiation, (b) fear, (c) indolence and (d) doubt, [respectively].	1
[Sthiramati] Y61.22 [1] The summary meaning of emptiness 437 should be understood both in terms of characteristic and establishment.	0
Of these, in terms of charac- teristic includes both the characteristic of non-existence and the characteristic of existence.	1
It [should be known] in terms of the characteristic of non-existence because of the statement: "the non-existence of the duality" (I.13 a).	1
It [should be known] in terms of the characteristic of existence because of the statement: "which consists in the existence of a non-existent" (I.13 b).	1
Furthermore, the characteristic of existence...; because of the statement: "it neither exists nor does it not exist" (1.13 c); ...refers to both the characteristic as devoid of exis- tence and non-existence438 and the characteristic as devoid of identity and difference, because of the statement: "...this is the characteristic of emptiness.	0
Therefore, in relation to the imagination of what is unreal:" (I.13 c comm.)	0
"The char- acteristic consists neither in difference nor identity."	1

Again, its establishment should be known in terms of the establishment of its synonyms etc.439 What is meant is: its synonyms, their meaning, its differ- entiation and logical proof.	1
Through these four modes of teaching, beginning with the characteristic, (a) its individual characteristic, (b) the characteristic of karma [pertinent to its realization], (c) the characteristic of both its defilement and purification and (d) the characteristic of reasoning [pertinent to its proof] are made known as the counteragents to the four types of secondary defilement440.	1
Of these, the individual characteristic [acts] as the counter- agent to conceptual differentiation; the latter consists in the perception [of things] as existent, non-existent, both [existent and non-existent] and different or identical.	1
The characteristic of karma [acts] as the counteragent to fear for those who, after learning of the characteristic of emptiness, do not have firm conviction, for example, (a) the karma that pertains to [the realization of] thusness that is free from error, (b) the karma that pertains to the absence of erroneous inversion, (c) the karma that pertains to the relinquishment of all signs, (d) the karma that exists in the sphere of all supra- mundane direct intuition and (e) in regard to the objective support, the karma that pertains to the causal ground of the noble qualities.	1
Thus, the characteristic of the differentiation is for the removal of indolence on the part of lazy people who, just by	1
the part of skeptics who believe that [emptiness] is subject to defilement and purification.	0

Chapter Two The ObscurationsN28.3 With reference to the obscurations, he says: II.1 abc [Sthiramati] 1.	0
The Five Obscurations Beginning with the Pervading.	1
Of these, (a) the pervading refers to obscuration consisting in both moral defilement and the knowable and is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it forms the totality.	1
(b) The limited refers to obscuration consisting in moral defilement and	1
etc.	0
(c) The excessive refers to [obscuration] that pertains only to those who course in passion etc.	1
(d) The equal refers to [obscuration] that pertains to those who course in equal shares.	1
(e) The obscuration com- prising the acceptance and rejection of samsāra is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it is an obscuration to the nirvana [wherein the bodhisattva is] not permanently fixed.	1
Thus these obscurations are elucidated respectively as being pertinent to both, i.e., as pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva as well as those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc.	0
(c) the excessive, (d) the equal and	1
elucidated as the obscurations that pertain to the two.	1
[1]2 Immediately after the explanation of the characteristic is an appropriate place for the explanation of obscuration and since [the latter] was mentioned immediately following the former, [Vasubandhu] says: with reference to the obscurations, [Maitreya] says: II.1 abc (a) The pervading, (b) the limited, (c) the excessive, (d) the equal and	0

The obscurations that pertain to the two refer to obscurations pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva and those who belong to the spiritual	1
the differentiation among the obscurations is in accordance with the difference in benefit that is obscured.	1
Of these, the pervading refers to obscuration con- sisting in both moral defilement and the knowable and is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva.	1
It is the	1
obscuration in regard to the totality of benefit; the totality of benefit is both benefit for oneself and benefit for others.	1
Alternatively, it is described as the pervading since it pervades the obscuration that pertains to the bodhisattva according to the designation of the two as obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable.	1
Since moral defilement is itself an obscuring, it is [described as] an obscuration.	1
Herein, secondary defilement is also referred to by the word "moral defilement" because it is exactly similar in its nature as moral defilement.	1
Otherwise, the words: "the character- istic of moral defilement is ninefold" [verse II.1 d], would not include envy and avarice since these two are both secondary defilements.	1
It is an obscuration that consists in the knowable because it is an obscuration in regard to the knowable.	1
Since that which is knowable is concealed (prāvṛta) on account of this, it is not the sphere of knowledge.	1
Alternatively, it is an obscuring of direct intuition in regard to the knowable because it creates an obstruction to the arising of direct intuition in regard to the knowable.	1
There is the omission of the word "of" between the words "obscuration" and "knowable" [in the compound jñeyāvaraṇa] as in the [tatpuruşa] compound 'a pot of oil' (tailakuṇḍa).	1
lineage of the bodhisattva endeavour in every way to produce the accumulations of merit and direct intuition for the sake of the attainment of Buddhahood since it is the culminating attainment3 in regard to benefit for both oneself and others.	1
Because both [those consisting in moral defilement and the knowable] are obscurations to the latter [i.e.	1
Buddhahood] they are determined as obscurations pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva.	1
[Objection]: In this respect, given that the	1
every respect", how does the totality intimate pervading?	1
[Response]: It is described as obscuration that pervades because it forms the totality by way of its explanation as a cause.	0
Alternatively, the statement: "because it forms the totality" is made in order to explain the word "pervading" as having the meaning of totality.	1
D: phul du byun ba thob pas (220a.5), although P: ...thob pa.Y66 [2] The limited refers to obscuration consisting in moral defilement and	0
etc.	0
It is designated as an obscuration since it is an obscuration in regard to just one's own benefit and is described as "limited" because it does not pervade.	1
Why does undefiled nescience not pertain to śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas?	1
Because if it is determined that only obscuration consisting in moral defilement is pertinent to them, then in that case, [undefiled nescience] is not an obscuration pertinent to them because śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas [are said to] attain enlightenment even though it exists.	1
[Objection]: Is nescience on the part of the śrävaka etc.	1
not an obscuration to the arising of knowledge in regard to the sphere of the truth of suffering etc.?	1
Therefore, the two obscurations would be pertinent to them as well.	1
Consequently, perhaps it should not be said that only obscuration consisting in moral defilement is pertinent to śrävakas etc.?	1
[Response]: This is not so, since ignorance is determined just as obscur- ation that consists in moral defilement because: (a) it is defiled, (b) it is adverse to knowledge and (c) it is the root of samsāra.	1
However it is not [determined as] obscura- tion that consists in the knowable, like uncertainty.	1
For example, uncertainty in regard to the sphere of the truth of suffering etc.	1
is not [uncertainty] in regard to other spheres described as doubt and moral defilement, for it is only uncertainty in regard to another sphere and not defilement nor doubt.	1
Similarly, nescience in regard to just the sphere of the truth of suffering etc.	1
is ignorance and moral defilement but not in regard to other spheres, for in regard to other spheres it is only nescience and not ignorance nor moral defilement.	1
Therefore, since [nescience] described as the obscuration that consists in the knowable because it is an obscuration to the emergence of only the direct intuition of what is knowable, moral defilement, karma and rebirth are not produced as is ignorance.	1
[Objection]: If this be so, [obscuration that consists in the knowable] cannot be determined as the obscuration pertinent to bodhisattvas.	1
[Response]: This is not so [since] obscuration that consists in the knowable is the obscuration pertinent to bodhisattvas because they are characterized by the accumu- lations of learning.	1
It is said: Without applying himself to the five kinds of learning, in no way can a Supremely Noble One arrive at omniscience; thus, he applies himself to these, either to restrain or assist others or, for his own knowledge.4 [3] The excessive; even a small aspect of passion etc.	1

...refers to	0
course in passion and the like refers to those for whom any passion manifests continu- ously and to an excessive degree even in regard to a miserable things.	1
[4] The equal; i.e., obscuration pertinent to both those belonging to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva and those belonging to the spiritual lineage of the śrāvaka etc.	1
It is equal because the two modes are absent; refers to [obscuration] pertin-	1
not continuously.	1
[5] The obscuration comprising the acceptance and rejection of samsāra...; the bodhisattva accepts samsāra on account of his compassion yet, on account of his wisdom, after observing the evil of samsara as it is in reality, he rejects7 it.	1
Consequently, although free from moral defilement [himself], having regard for sentient beings, he takes rebirth in the nirväpa [wherein the bodhisattva is] not permanently fixed, because he is not permanently fixed in samsara or nirvāṇa.	1
The obscuration to this consists in the acceptance of samsāra as being overcome by moral defilement or the complete rejection of samsăra without compassion, after observing its evil as it is in reality.	1
Others believe that nescience is described as an obscuration herein because it is an obstruction to both compassion and wisdom.	1
Alternatively, as has been stated in the Maharatnakūta: "His mental disposition is directed towards nirvāṇa but his application is directed towards samsara"8.	1
This is the unfixed nirvana of the bodhisattva.	1
In this regard, in order to turn his back on nirvāṇa he accepts samsāra with his mental disposition and application, just like a sentient being who has no spiritual lineage.	1
Similarly, in order to turn his back on samsāra, he completely rejects samsāra with both his mental disposition and application directed towards entering nirvāṇa, just like those who belong to the spiritual lineage of śrävakas etc.	1
Thus, both the acceptance of samsāra and its rejection are obscurations in regard to the unfixed nirvana of the bodhisattva because they both constitute a falling to one extreme away from samsāra as well as nirvāṇa.	1
At the time that they become tathā- gatas, bodhisattvas do not remain in samsāra because they have relinquished both the obscurations that consist in moral defilement and the knowable.	1
And because the Dharma Body continues without interruption in the nirvana devoid of the remnants of	1

fixed permanently in samsāra or nirvāņa.	0
[6] These five obscurations have been enumerated here because they cause obstruction in regard to: (a) the path of the bodhisattva and the śrävaka etc., (b) their application, (c) the result and (d) the unfixed nirvana [of the bodhisattva).	1
Thus these [obscurations are elucidated] respectively, i.e.	1
as is appropriate.	1
Therein, the first and the last [i.e.	1
the 'pervading' and 'acceptance and rejection'] are obscurations pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva.	1
But that which follows the first [i.e.	1
the limited'] is an obscuration pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc.	1
The other two [i.e.	1
the excessive' and the 'equal'] are obscurations pertinent to both.	1
In the above, obscuration that consists in the knowable has been described as obscuration that pertains to the bodhisattvas, moreover, it is known as undefiled nescience.	1
Furthermore, II.1 d 2.	0
The Obscuration that Consists in the Nine Fetters to Application.	1
The characteristic of moral defile- ment is ninefold.	1
The nine fetters refer to obscurations that consist in moral defile- ment.	1
The obscurations that comprise these [fetters] are relevant to	1
II.2 a II.2 bc They are relevant to anxiety, equanimity and the insight into reality;	0
fetter of repugnance is [an obscuration] relevant to equanimity because on account of this, one is unable to be even-minded in regard to the foundation of repugnance, especially something disagreeable.	1
The remaining [fetters] are obscurations relevant to the insight into reality.	1
How do they occur?	1
They occur respectively...Y69 II.2 d II.3 abc In the clear comprehension of the false view of individuality, the foun- dation of the latter;	0
jewels, gain and honour and austerity.	1
the non-relinquishment of the latter is on account of the manifestation of intermittent and continuous self-conceit at the time of direct reali- zation.	1
The fetter of ignorance [is an obscuration] in the clear compre- hension of the foundation of the false view of individuality because the lack of clear comprehension in regard to the aggregates that have been appropriated is on account of that.	1
The fetter that consists in false view [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the truth of cessation	1
individuality and the grasping of extremes and is also due to negation by wrong view.	1
The fetter of clinging [to false views etc.]	1
is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the truth of the path because one clings to the highest purity with the wrong motive.	1
The fetter of doubt is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the three jewels	1
envy is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of gain and honour because one does not perceive the faults of the latter.	1
The fetter of avarice is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of austerity	1
[Sthiramati] [1] It is not known: (a) how many aspects there are to the obscuration that consists in moral defilement which is the obscuration pertinent to the two [i.e.	1
bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc.	1
], (b) what kind of essential nature they possess and (c) what it is they obstruct, hence he says: II.1 d The characteristic of moral defile- ment is ninefold.	0
It is the obscurations that are referred to.	1
The characteristic of moral defilement is [equivalent to] the essential nature of moral defilement.	1
What are these ninefold [fetters]?	1
Hence he says: [they are]:	1
11.2 a	0
They are fetters inasmuch as they fetter [people] to various sufferings.	1
The various sufferings which belong to the group of sense-desire, form and formlessness, refer to the painful nature of suffering, the painful nature of change and the painful nature of	1
the fetter of attachment and conclude with the fetter of avarice.	1
Therein, repugnance refers to aversion.	1
Envy refers to intolerance in regard to another's success 10.	1
Avarice refers to miserliness concerning the necessities of lifell; these three pertain to sense- desire.	1
The fetter of attachment consists in the passion that pertains to the three realms of existence.	1
Similarly, the fetters of pride, ignorance, false view, clinging [to false views etc.]	1
and doubt all pertain to the three realms of existence.	1
The fetter of false view comprises the false view of individuality, the grasping of extremes and wrong view.	1
The fetter of clinging [to false views etc.)	1
comprises the clinging to false view and to morality and vows.	1
Doubt is disbelief in regard to the [noble] truths and the [three] jewels.	1
Moreover, those other secondary defilements, such as anger, are defi- nitely obscurations that consist in moral defilement because they are the natural outcome of moral defilement and they are defiled.	1
Envy and avarice are referred to as fetters because of their predominance, for it is said in a Sutra: "O Kausika, the gods and mankind possess the fetters of envy and avarice" 12.	1
[2] The obscurations that comprise these [fetters] are relevant to what?	1
Hence he says: II.2 bc They are relevant to anxiety, equanimity and the insight into reality;	0
of attachment is an obscuration relevant to anxiety.	1
Since the attachment to the physical body, vitality, enjoyment and family etc.	1
as well as to the meditative	1
anxious of the three realms, although oppressed by the sufferings of samsära.	1
The fetter of repugnance is [an obscuration] relevant to equaniraity.	1
How so?	1
Hence he says: because, on account of this, one is unable to be even- minded, i.e.	1
free from formative influence, in regard to the foundation of repugnance, i.e., the cause of repugnance, especially something disagreeable etc.	1
; it is disagreeable insofar as it is the cause of depression.	1
It is logical that it is not	1

absence of what is disagreeable.	1
However, since the foundation of repugnance consists in repugnance especially in regard to something disagreeable, one is unable to be even-minded.	1
Hence in order to demonstrate that the latter [i.e.	1
the fetter of repug- nance] is a greater evil than [the fetter of] attachment, he says: "especially".	0
When one who is engaged in meditative concentration gains equanimity of the formative forces, his mind consequently becomes even.	1
However, if the fetter of repugnance reaches an excessive degree in such a person, then on account of the latter, he does not attain equanimity in regard to the cause of repugnance; and when that occurs the self is necessarily supported as an objective support; thus, on account of the fetter of attach- ment he does not find solitude.	1
Conversely, although isolated on account of the fetter of repugnance he does not attain meditative concentration.	1
[3] Furthermore, the remaining seven [fetters] are obscurations relevant to the insight into reality, i.e.	1
they are obscurations to true insight.	1
He asks: How do they occur?	1
Since this is not known he says: They occur respectively: II.2 d [In the clear comprehension] of: the false view of individuality, the foun- dation of the latter etc.	0
The fetter of pride is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the false view of individuality.	1
Pride herein refers to that arrogance of mind which has the false view of individuality for its basis 13 and this is sevenfold ¹4 according to its differentiation as pride, excessive pride etc.15 The clear comprehension of the false view of individuality refers to the insight into the false view of individuality through the discrimination of: (a) a self, (b) what pertains to a self, (c) the apprehending subject and (d) the apprehended object, as well as through the discrimination ¹6 of an own-	1
an obscuration to that [insight] because it obstructs its arising.	1
As to how and when this occurs, he says: because the non-relinquishment of the latter is on account of the manifestation of intermittent and continuous self-conceit at the time of direct realization18.	1
The time of direct realization of the truth is equivalent to the condition that is conducive to penetration.	1
In the above "intermittent" refers to that which is interrupted by the counteragent; "continuous" refers to that	1
division is substantiated by the T-Bhaşya (L29.4-17) where seven kinds of pride are defined.	0

to strong and weak counteragents [respectively].	1
For as long as intermittent and con- tinuous self-conceit19 manifests, there is no relinquishment of the false view of indi- viduality since the arising of self-conceit is only on account of the false view of individuality.	1
[4] The fetter of ignorance [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehen- sion of the foundation of the false view of individuality.	1
It is the fact that it is an obscuration that is referred to.	1
The foundation of the false view of individuality refers to the five aggregates that have been appropriated because it arises from the objective support that consists therein; as is stated in a Sutra: Certain śramaṇas or brahmanas perceive the self as the self and are notionally attached to it; it is just on the basis of these five aggregates that have been appropriated that they perceive and are notionally attached to the latter.20 Just what is this clear comprehension?	1
It is the perception of the emptiness of the self and what pertains to the self21 and the emptiness of the own-being of the dharmas which is imagined by naive people in regard to the aggregates as well as their percep- tion as impermanent, painful, empty, without self or as originating etc.	1
this is clear	1
lack of clear comprehension in regard to the aggregates that have been appropriated is on account of that.	1
Ignorance is an obscuration in the clear	1
of clear comprehension of these [as impermanent etc.]	1
in regard to the aggregates which are obscured by aspects of permanence etc.	1
[5] The fetter that consists in false view [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the truth of cessation; the word "obscuration" remains in force.	1
The fetter of false view comprises three false views: The false views of: (a) individuality, (b) grasping of extremes and (c) wrong [view].	1
In the above, the false view of individuality refers to the notion that there is a self or what pertains to a self among the five aggregates that have been appropriated.	1
The false view that consists in the grasping of extremes concerns that same entity that has been construed as a self and refers to the notion that it is eternal or that it perishes22.	1
Wrong view refers to that notion on account of which one negates an entity, whether it be cause, result, deed or an actual existent, or else wrongly construes it.	1

tranquil.	1
Just how can [false view] be an obscuration to that [clear comprehension]?	1
Hence he says: because the fear of the latter [i.e.	1
cessation] is on account of the false views of both individuality and the grasping of extremes and is also due to negation23 by wrong view.	0
Therein, on account of the false views of individuality and the grasping of extremes one fears cessation, thinking: "I will not exist in that [state]", also, on account of wrong view one negates it, thinking there is indeed no cessation.	1
In this respect, on account of the false views of individu- ality and the grasping of extremes, one does not clearly comprehend [cessation] as tranquil, sublime and as escape24; yet on account of wrong view one does not compre- hend it as cessation.	1
In this way the fetter that consists in false view becomes an obscuration in the clear comprehension of cessation.	1
[6] The fetter of clinging [to false view etc.]	1
is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the truth of the path25.	0
Therein, the fetter of clinging refers to both the clinging to false view and the clinging to morality and vows.	1
Cling- ing to false view therein refers to that notion in regard to false view and the five aggre- gates that have been appropriated and which are the basis of false view26, as being pre- eminent27 and so on.	1
Clinging to morality and vows refers to that notion on the part of one who perceives either morality, vows, both of these or the five aggregates that have been appropriated and which are the basis of that [notion], as being [equivalent to] purity, liberation or definitive liberation.	1
Furthermore, the clear comprehension of the path is in accordance with aspects, such as definitive liberation.	1
Just how can the fetter of clinging be an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the path?	1
Hence he says: because one clings to the [highest] purity with the wrong motive28; i.e.	1
because one clings to purity as either: (a) just morality and vows, (b) an abode of pleasure pertinent to sense-desire, (c) ascetic practices or (d) the knowledge of enu- merations etc.	1
By clinging to a [false] view on account of just which one believes in purity, one clings to that same [view] as being pre-eminent.	1
Thus, on account of the fetter of clinging [to false view etc.]	1
one abandons the path and clings to purity with the wrong motive29 24 Ms.(20b.1): nisaraṇataś, but Y's emendation to niḥsaranatas is preferred; cf.	0

As to how this can be so, he says: because of the lack of true belief in their virtues.	1
The fetter of doubt is perplexity in regard to the truths and the [three] jewels.	1
There is clear com- prehension in regard to the jewel of the Buddha as being the final basis for the	1
hension in regard to the jewel of the Dharma: (a) as being the conveyance across the ocean of samsära, (b) as having the nature of the absolute separation from all suffer- ing31 together with its causes and (c) as providing the understanding of the latter.	1
There is clear comprehension in regard to the jewel of the Sangha as: (a) the locus for the results of monkhood³2, (b) engagement in the latter and (c) the 'field' worthy of supreme veneration.	1
By acquiring perfect faith through the perception of truth and the relinquishment of doubt³ one truly believes in the virtues of the three jewels and since there remains no doubt that is not relinquished, the fetter of doubt is described 34 as an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the three jewels.	1
[8] The fetter of envy is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of gain and honour.	1
Here now he gives the reason: because one does not perceive the faults of the latter.	1
For the fetter of envy, which has aversion for a component, refers to the dissatisfaction of mind in regard to another's success and is pertinent to one intent upon gain and honour³5.	1
Clear comprehension in regard to gain and honour is [equivalent to] the awareness that these are the basis of all misfortune³6 However, on account of envy one does not clearly comprehend gain and honour ³7 as being adverse to all virtue nor as the root of various misfortunes.	1
Hence the fetter of envy is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of gain and honour.	1
[9] The fetter of avarice [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of austerity.	1
As to how this can be so, he says: because one covets the	1

ness of mind in regard to goods and chattels on the part of one who is intent upon ³8 the necessities of life.	1
Austerity consists in the separation from from the necessities of life.	1
basis of all virtue.	1
However, one does not clearly comprehend it as the basis of all virtue because one is intent upon the necessities of life on account of avarice.	1
Consequently, it is said that avarice is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of austerity.39 [10] In [summary of the above, the fetters of attachment and repugnance are obscura- tions in the endeavour to reach an understanding of reality [but the remainder are not]40.	1
The remainder are obscurations to the understanding of reality for one who has [already] applied himself [in such an endeavour].	1
For this very reason the sequential order of these [fetters] is given; for example, one who desires liberation41 should, from the very beginning, necessarily cause his mind to shrink from samsāra.	1
Following from that, he should have equanimity towards everything.	1
After that, the false view of individuality should be clearly comprehended because it is the root of all misfortune.	1
Then, the foundation of the latter should be clearly comprehended as consisting in suffering and its arising.	1
Then, the cessation of the latter should be understood.	1
Then, the path of attainment should be understood.	1
Then, one acquires perfect faith in regard to the three jeweis due to the awareness of their virtues and the vision of the truth.	1
And since it is only on account of the force of the vision of the truth that one becomes a seer of the faults and virtues [respectively] of gain and honour as well as austerity, thus the sequential order of these obscurations should be understood in conformity with the respective cause of the dharmas to be obscured 42.	1
[Objection]: Since it is possible that obscuration can pertain to all [the fetters] at all times43, the explanation of obscuration as restricted to each individual foundation is not tenable.	1
[Response]: A restriction 44 to each individual foundation is not employed here; on the contrary, this explanation is chiefly in terms of close contiguity.	0

II.9 abcd Which are the [qualities] beginning with The qualities beginning with virtue are: (i) virtue, (ii) enlightenment, (iii) complete acceptance, (iv) intelli- gence, (v) absence of error, (vi) absence of obscuration, (vii) trans- formation, (viii) lack of fear, (ix) lack of avarice and (x) mastery.	0
Which obscurations are to be known as being pertinent to each of these [qualities] beginning with virtue?	1
II.10 ab The obscurations that pertain to these [qualities] are to be known in groups of three.	1
The three obscurations to the wholesome are: (a) lack of application, (b) application in regard to unworthy objects and (c) superficial appli- cation.	1
The three obscurations to enlightenment are: (a) the non-arising of the wholesome, (b) lack of mental attention and (c) incomplete accu- mulations.	1
Complete acceptance refers to the generation of the resolve for enlightenment.	1
The three [obscurations] to the latter are: (a) depri- vation of spiritual lineage, (b) deprivation of good friends and (c) mental exhaustion.	1
Intelligence refers to the bodhisattva state.	1
The three obscurations to the recognition of the latter are: (a) deprivation of spiritual practice, (b) living with stupid people and (c) living with pernicious people.	1
Therein, stupid people are [equivalent to] foolish people; pernicious people are those who bear il will.	1
The three	1
inversions, (b) whatever remains from the three obscurations such as moral defilement and (c) the non-maturation of the wisdom that brings liberation to fruition.	1
Absence of obscuration is [equivalent to the relinquishment of obscuration.	1
The three [obscurations] to the latter are: (a) innate disquiet, (b) laziness and (c) carelessness.	1
The three	1
transformed into other modes and not into supreme and perfect enlightenment, are: (a) attachment to existence, (b) attachment to enjoyments and (c) faintheartedness.	1
The three [obscurations] to lack of fear are: (a) a low opinion of people, (b) a lack of firm conviction in regard to the Dharma and (c) deliberation in accord with the letter as	1
a lack of enthusiasm for the true Dharma, (b) enthusiasm for gain and honour and for veneration and (c) lack of compassion for sentient beings.	1
The three [obscurations] to mastery, on account of which one fails to obtain supremacy, are: (a) loss of what has been learnt due to the arising of karma conducive to the loss of the Dharma, (b) learning little and (c) lack of the necessary preparation for meditative concentration.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] Are the latter [i.e the obscurations that consist in the nine fetters] the only obscu- rations?	1
These are common to both bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc.	1
however, obscura- tions that pertain to the bodhisattvas [alone] are: II.3 d The others are relevant to the tenfold [qualities] beginning with virtue.45	1
(i) Lack of application, [application] Since it is not known as to	1

In the	0

in regard to unworthy objects and what is produced without application [etc.]	1
These are described as virtuous.	1
Since enlightenment cannot be understood by way of own-being through words alone, he describes it as: Read: śubhādau daśadha 'param in place of anyad daśaśubhādişu; cf.	0

[2] Some believe that since the obscurations to virtue and enlightenment are explained as independent, as are [the obscurations to] complete acceptance etc., they are discerned in this context just as independent [entities] but not as things that can be listed and explained.	0
[This is not so]; the obscuration to arising is determined in relation to virtue and it is common to such things as the resolve for enlightenment because of the necessity for the production of that virtue.	1
The obscuration to complete acceptance etc.	1
and the obscuration to the basis are obscurations to complete acceptance etc.	1
and are different [from the obscuration to virtue]49.	1
Also, since enlightenment is unshakable and is to be attained, both the obscuration to its maintenance and the obscuration to its attainment are respectively determined.	1
Therefore, independence does not result here.	1
[3] And their sequential order in brief is as follows: Enlightenment is to be attained after perfecting the root of the wholesome in its entirety.	1
In detail [it is as follows]: From the very beginning the resolve towards enlightenment should be generated because it is the foundation for the accomplishment of benefit for both oneself and others.	1
Then comes spiritual practice in regard to [the six perfections], beginning with generosity, which conforms with 50 the generation of the resolve, and, on account of which, one is recognized51 as a bodhisattva.	1
After that, as the result of continual practice throughout immeasurable aeons 52 and in order to purify one's mental disposi- tion through the collection of the accumulations of merit and direct intuition, the path of vision, which has the nature of the absence of error, should be generated as the counter- agent to error in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas.	1
Then the path of meditative development which is characterized by the separation from obscuration should be followed to its culminating point in order to bring about the possession of a special purity53.	1
Then, all the mundane and supramundane roots of the wholesome	1

[4] Here the obscurations are stated as thirty, but only ten qualities to be obscured [are stated] beginning with virtue, hence he asks: which obscurations are to be known as being pertinent to each of these [qualities] beginning with virtue?	1
II.10 ab The obscurations that pertain to these [qualities] are to be known in groups of three57;	1
application, i.e.	0
lack of enterprise.	1
What is the obscuration in this context?	1
One does not apply oneself on account of any moral defilement, whether it be carelessness or laziness.	1
Or else, one does not apply oneself to that particular condition, whether it be undefined or defiled, that possesses the 'seed' of moral defilement.	1
It is described as the lack of application since one does not apply oneself continually or respectfully because [one's application] is insignificant but not because of an absence of application,	1
'doorway' (dvāra) to the origination of enlightenment and the roots of the wholesome	0
the latter is an unworthy object (anāyatana).	1
Application in regard to the latter is appli- cation in regard to an unworthy object59, i.e.	1
in regard to objects other [than worthy objects].	1
What is the obscuration here?	1
The nescience or moral defilement that consists in wrong view on account of which one applies oneself to an unworthy object as well as that application is the obscuration.	1
(c) Superficial application.	1
An expedient60 is something fundamental (yon); application that is contrarywise to what- ever expedient one possesses is superficial (ayoniśaḥ) application.	1

obscuration.	1
[5] The three [obscurations] to enlightenment...; enlightenment consists in an understanding that is in accord with its object.	1
...are: (a) the non-arising of the wholesome, which has already been discussed.	1
How can its non-arising be an obscuration?	1
When the wholesome does not exist there can be no enlightenment, hence the non-arising of the wholesome is an obscuration to enlightenment.	1
Alterna- tively, that moral defilement or particular state which is an obscuration to the arising of the wholesome 63 is also [an obscuration] to enlightenment, for that which is an obscu- ration to the accumulations [of merit and direct intuition] is certainly also [an obscura- tion] to its result.	1
(b) Lack of mental attention, is [equivalent to] the lack of the meditative development of [wholesome elements] that have already arisen; what is meant is: they are not augmented64, Even though wholesome [elements] are produced in a particular state, one is not mentally attentive time and again65 on account of moral defilement such as laziness.	1
This is the obscuration here.	1
(c) Incomplete accu- mulations.	1
Enlightenment is attained through a certain amount of accumulations.	1
While the accumulations of merit and direct intuition are incomplete one abides in a morally defiled condition like before, or eise, one has scanty accumulations.	1
However, another believes that although no distinction is made here, non-arising is intended just as [an obscuration]66 to those elements conducive to penetration and not to others.	0
Also, there can be a lack of mental attention to those [elements conducive to penetra- tion] that have arisen, although one is being mentally attentive; the non-accumulation of what has been accumulated [on account of that] is described as an obscuration.	1
[6] Complete acceptance refers to the generation of the resolve for enlightenment.	1
Complete acceptance consists in the generation of the resolve for enlightenment since the accumulations of merit and direct intuition, in their entirety, and the result of these, i.e.	1
Buddhahood, are to be completely accepted and possessed on account of the fact that they should cause all sentient beings67 to be established in the most excellent nirvāṇa realm devoid of the remnants of existence by means of this	1

Furthermore, this consists in the mental disposition to perform acts of welfare for oneself and others, i.e., it is volition accompanied by will-	1
lineage of the śrävaka etc.	1
(b) Deprivation of good friends; i.e., although one belongs to a spiritual lineage, one does not meet with those who inspire the generation of the resolve for enlightenment69; or else, on account of these [people], one turns away from enlightenment, or is not strengthened by the wholesome dharmas.	1
Even when one meets with good friends, there is (c) mental exhaustion70 - on account of the sufferings of samsara the anxious minds of those who have wrong insight	1
defect in causes [i.e.	1
gotra], (b) a defect in conditions [i.e.	1
kalyāṇamitra], (c) lack of compassion for sentient beings71 or (d) laziness, since one who lacks compassion for sentient beings is either exhausted or is lazy.	0
[7] Intelligence72 refers to the bodhisattva state, for they are suited to the	1
have keen faculties.	1
And it is just the bodhisattva who possesses intelligence because of his firm conviction in the profound and sublime Dharma; others do not.	1
The bodhisattva state consists in spiritual practice that is not erroneously inverted for the benefit of others74.	1
(a) Deprivation of spiritual practice75; i.e.	1
one does not engage in the practice of the [six] perfections etc., for, one who is situated in' spiritual practice76 is known as a bodhisattva.	1
(b) Stupid people are [equivalent to] foolish people77; what is meant is: people who do not investigate [phenomena] because, stupid people do not know that a particular person is a bodhisattva even though he is occupied with spiritual practice 78, (c) Pernicious people are those who bear ill will; i.e.	1
those who bear enmity towards bodhisattvas.	1

Having concealed the real virtues [of the bodhisattva] they promulgate non- existent faults after superimposing the latter upon the former because they see non- existent faults or have harmful thoughts on account of enmity.	1
What is the obscuration here?	1
(a) That which is adverse to the [six] perfections such as generosity, (b) nescience and (c) dislike.	1
[8] The three [obscurations] to absence of error...; error is on account of superimposition and negation80; its counteragent is the absence of error and is [equivalent to] the path of vision; ...are: (a) the disquiet of erroneous inver- sions.	0

believe it refers to the maturation of the 'seeds' lodged in the store-consciousness of: (a) all propensities that are to be abandoned by means of [the path of] vision, or (b) unde- filed nescience which is an impediment to 82 the facility for an understanding 83 of the all-pervading dharmadhātu.	1
Others believe that erroneous inversion refers to the conceptual notion of the self etc.	1
in regard to the absence of self etc.	1
(b) Whatever remains from the three obscurations such as moral defilement84.	1
Therein, obscuration that consists in moral defilement is the moral defilement such as passion which manifests intensely and for a long time; it is an obscuration to the absence of error because there is no opportunity for the application of the counteragent to it.	1
Obscuration that consists in karma is the karma that brings an immediate result etc.	1
and which leads necessarily 85 to unfortunate states of existence.	1
Obscuration that consists in the karma-result is the unfortunate state of existence etc.	1
and one who is born therein does not have the good fortune of the arising of the noble Dharma.	1
Moreover, what- ever is left as a remainder from these [three], i.e.	1
moral defilement, karma and rebirth, are obscurations but they are definitely not the entire [obscurations]86.	0
(c) The non- maturation of the wisdom which brings liberation to fruition87; this refers to the fact that the wisdom which brings about liberation is ineffective.	1

ever, others say that there are two [types] of wisdom in this regard which bring liberation to fruition: (a) absence of conceptual differentiation and (b) the application of the latter³8.	1
The non-maturation of both of these, which respectively consists in an incapacity concerning the understanding of reality and an incapacity concerning the state that causes the latter89, is due to the fact that the accumulations are incomplete.	1
What are the obscurations here?	1
(a) The maturation of the latent impressions of moral defilement that are to be abandoned by the path of] vision90, (b) whatever remains from the obscurations such as moral defilement, (c) nescience which is an impediment to the maturation of wisdom and (d) the non-completion of the accumulations.	1
[9] Absence of obscuration is [equivalent to the relinquishment of obscuration.	1
It is the relinquishment of obscuration since obscuration is relin- quished on account of it.	1
The absence of obscuration consists in the path of meditative development because this is the counteragent to obscuration.	1
The three [obscurations] to the latter are: (a) innate disquiet.	1
This refers to the propensity for moral defilement that is to be abandoned by meditative development.	1
Alternatively, this refers to the maturation of the 'seeds' that are lodged 91 in the store- consciousness, of: (a) the innate (elements] such as the false view of self and (b) unde- filed nescience 92 which is an impediment to the penetration of the highest meaning of the dharmadhātu etc93.	1
(b) Laziness is [equivalent to] slothfulness; this refers to the lethargy of mind that has delusion for a component 94.	0
(c) Carelessness consists in both an excessive attachment to sense-objects and an inattentiveness in regard to the	1
concentration.	1
Due to disquiet and laziness in this respect, the path is not cultivated	1

obscurations here?	0
These very three.	1
[10] The three [obscurations] to transformation 96 on account of which one's mind is transformed into other modes; [and is not transformed into supreme and perfect enlightenment]97.	1
Transformation 98 therein refers to [the trans- formation] of the roots of the wholesome which have already arisen and is restricted to [the transformation] by mind into Buddhahood alone.	0
There are three obscurations to the latter.	1
Which are these three?	1
Those, on account of which, mind is transformed into modes99 other than Buddhahood, i.e.	1
into samsāra or the enlightenment of the śrāvakas etc., ...and not into supreme and perfect enlightenment.	1
And these are: (a) attachment to existence, (b) attachment to enjoyments and (c) faintheartedness.	1
"Existence" refers to the five aggregates that have been appro- priated.	1
Since they are enjoyed (bhujyante), the sense-objects of form etc.	1
are "enjoyments" (bhoga).	1
"Attachment" is the strong desire for the latter two.	1
"Faintheartedness" refers to a mind that lacks sublimity; i.e.	1
one has a low opinion of oneself and thinks: "how can someone like mel00 obtain Buddhahood?"	0
In regard to this, on account of the attachment to existence and the attachment to enjoyments, one's mind is transformed into a propitious state of existence; however, on account of faint- heartedness, the mind is transformed into the śrävaka vehicle etc.	1
What are the obscu- rations in this regard?	1
They are: the craving for existence and enjoyments, laziness and lack of compassion.	1
[11] The three [obscurations] to lack of fear.	1
What is this lack of fear?	1
It is a fearless state that consists in a firm conviction101 in regard to emptiness and the profound and sublime Dharma of the Buddha and the bodhisattvas.	1
(a) A low opinion of people; i.e.	1
erroneous understandings and statements about people who proclaim the way of the universal vehicle, or disbelief in the virtues of morality, medi- tative concentration and wisdom etc.	1
(b) lack of firm conviction in the Dharma; i.e.	1
disbelief concerning the words of the Buddha as expounding a profound and sublime way and as having meaning that is not erroneously inverted.	1
(c) Deliberation in accord with the letter as regards its meaning 102; i.e.	1
one understands only the verbatim meaning of 'non-arisen', 'without cessation' and 'peaceful from the beginning' etc., but the meaning that is intended in reality is not understood.	1

Note: (vi)cāraṇā cărthe here, but Bhāşya vicāraṇārthe.Y83 Therefore, there is no firm conviction in regard to the meaning of 'non-arisen' etc.	0
What are the obscurations here?	1
(a) Doubt and (b) nescience which is adverse to both wisdom and meditative concentration and is also adverse to a conclusive investi- gation¹03 of the meaning that is intended.	1
[12] The three [obscurations] to lack of avarice...	1
It is on account of the lack of avarice that one teaches the Dharma, either for the continued existence of the true Dharma, or in order to assist others.	1
are: (a) lack of enthusiasm for the true Dharma; i.e.	1
not holding it dear.	1
It is on account of this that the true Dharma's long- lasting existence is not ensured because it is not conveyed to another's mental continuum.	1
(b) Enthusiasm for gain and honour and for veneration; i.e.	1
holding them dear.	1
One worries that another may be equal or even superior to oneself concerning enthusiasm for the true Dharma, and consequently, one does not teach the Dharma because of fear that gain etc.	1
will be hindered.	1
[Alternatively], although one does not cling to gain and honour, there is: (c) a lack of compassion for sentient beings; i.e.	1
one does not teach the Dharma] 104 due to an absence of com- passion for sentient beings because one who lacks compassion is not affected by the sufferings of sentient beings.	0
What are the obscurations here?	1
(a) Lack of enthusiasm, (b) attachment to gain and honour and (c) lack of compassion.	1
[13] The three [obscurations] to mastery.	1
Since mastery consists in the attainment of all kinds of masteries of the mind, mastery is [equivalent to] Buddha- hood105.	0
But since the three obscurations to the latter are not known, he says: on account of which one fails to obtain106 supremacy.	1
He states that the obscu- rations to mastery are those on account of which supremacy is not obtained, because supremacy is dependent upon the mastery of mind.	1
Furthermore, supremacy refers to excellence in regard to direct intuition, relinquishment and power.	1
Alternatively, by the statement: "...those on account of which supremacy is not obtained", [supremacy] is demonstrated as a synonym for mastery 107.	0
What is meant is: Buddhahood 108 is not attained.	1
(a) The loss of what has been learnt.	1

loss of what has been learnt is due to the arising of karmal10 conducive to the loss of the truell1 Dharma; i.e.	1
because they either abide in the attachment to their own views or they have recourse to people who are not good friends, the Sūtras of the universal vehicle are rejected by those who lack remorse saying: "these words are spoken by Māra and are the cause of unfortunate states of existence; these words are not spoken by the Buddha", and they deter other people from these [Sūtras].	1
They efface the writings, burn and submerge them in water and so, in various ways, there is	1
maturation of the 'seed' of an individual nature113 that is deprived of hearing the true Dharma.	1
[Alternatively], when there is no loss of what has been learnt, (b) learning	1
incomplete and one who has little learning is unable to analyse the dharmas.	1
And [alternatively], even if one has much learning, (c) lack of the necessary prepa- ration for meditative concentration114 is referred to as an obscuration.	1
The lack of the necessary preparation for meditative concentration is due to: (a) the absence of any of [the qualities] beginning with will-power, or (b) the non-completion of medita- tive development¹15 because of the absence of any of the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment.	1
Alternatively, the lack of necessary preparation refers to the non-perfection of the Buddha's meditative concentrations such as the Vajra-like [concentration]116.	0
What are obscurations here?	1
They are: (a) karma conducive to the loss of the Dharma, (b) learning little, (c) weakness in wisdom and (d) the secondary defilements that are adverse to meditative concentration such as spiritual indifference and restlessness.	1

These same daśakāraṇāni are listed in AS (P28.12) where karanam is defined as the "own-being of the cause" (hetusvabhava).N32	0
are: (a) The cause for origination; for example, the eyes etc.	1
[are the cause] for eye-consciousness, (b) The cause for continued existence; for example, the four types of food [are the cause for the continued existence] of sentient beings.	1
(c) The cause for support refers to that which is the foundation of something; for example, the inanimate world [is the cause for the support] of the world of sentient beings.	1
(d) The cause for manifestation; for example, sight [is the cause for the mani- festation] of form.	1
(e) The cause for modification; for example, fire etc.	1
[is the cause for the modification] of cooked food etc.	1
(f) The cause for disjunction; for example, the scythe [is the cause for the dis- junction] of that which is to be severed.	1
(g) The cause for transfor- mation; for example, a gold-smith etc.	1
[is the cause for the tran for- mation] of gold etc.	1
when it is transformed into things such as bracelets.	1
(h) The cause for a belief; for example, smoke etc.	1
[is the cause for the belief that there is] fire etc.	1
(i) The cause for making [others] believe; for example, the logical reason is the cause for making (others) believe] in a premise.	1
(j) The cause for attainment; for example, the path etc.	1
[is the cause for the attainment] of nirvăpa etc.	1
Thus the obscuration to origination is to be regarded [as an obscu- ration] to virtue because of the necessity for the origination of the latter.	1
The obscuration to continued existence is [an obscuration] to enlightenment because of the unshakability of the latter.	1
The obscu- ration to support is [an obscuration] to complete acceptance because the latter is the foundation of the resolve for enlightenment.	1
The obscu- ration to manifestation is [an obscuration] to the possession of intelli- gence because of the necessity for the promulgation of the latter.	1
The obscuration to modification is [an obscuration] to the absence of error because the latter changes into the reverse of error.	1
The obscuration to disjunction is [an obscuration] to the absence of obscuration because the latter is [equivalent to] separation from obscuration.	1
The obscu- ration to transformation is [an obscuration] to development because the latter is characterized by the transformation of mind into enlightenment.	1
The obscuration to belief is [an obscuration] to lack of fear because fear is due to disbelief.	1
The obscuration to making [others] believe is [an obscuration] to lack of avarice because others are made to believe on account of lack of avarice in regard to the Dharma.	1
The obscuration to attainment is [an obscuration] to mastery because the latter is charac- terized by the attainment of supremacy.N33 In regard to origination, continued existence, support, manifestation, modification, disjunction, transfor- mation, belief, making [others] believe and attainment, the causes are tenfold.	1
The examples of these begin with the	1
fire;	0
a craftsman, smoke, the logical cause and the path.	1
118 Now, from the very beginning, on account of the desire to attain enlightenment, the root of the wholesome should be generated.	1
Then, by engendering the force of the root of the wholesome, enlightenment should be attained.	1
Moreover, the resolve towards enlightenment is the support for the origination of the root of the wholesome.	1
The bodhisattva is the [physical] basis of that resolve towards enlighten- ment.	1
Moreover, in order to relinquish119 erroneous inversion, the absence of erroneous inversion is to be generated by the bodhisattva who has secured the engendering of the force of the root of the whole-	1
all obscuration should be relinquished on the path of meditative develop- ment on account of the absence of erroneous inversion¹20 on the path of vision and all the roots of the wholesome should be transformed into supreme and perfect enlightenment owing to the relinquishment of obscuration.	1
Then, by engendering the forces of transformation, there should be no fear in regard to the profound and sublime Dharma teach- ings.	1
Thus, these Dharmas should be revealed to others in full detail by	1
Dharmas.	1
Following that, the bodhisattva who has secured the engen- dering of the forces of the various virtues in this way soon arrives at supreme and perfect enlightenment, having acquired mastery over all	1
later interpolation peculiar to the Bhaşya because it receives no comment by Sthiramati.	0

categories] beginning with virtue.	0
[Sthiramati] [1] Furthermore, these obscurations beginning with lack of application in regard to virtue etc., i.e.	1
in regard to the tenfold categories concluding with	1
ive category], in relation to which there are ten [instrumental] causes¹21, i.e.	0
in relation to each category 122, beginning with origination and concluding with attainment, there are ten causes, beginning with application123 and concluding with the necessary preparation for meditative concentration, because they are contrary to those obscurations.	1
And although they are individually differentiated here, this explanation does not differentiate [i.e.	1
it designates them all as causes] because no distinction is made concerning causality in regard to origination and the other [nine].	1
According to the influence of each [respective] category; what is meant is: according to the predominance of the category, such as origination.	1
For, when there is an obstruc- tion to the cause of the origination etc.	1
of these [categories] such as virtue, it is described as an obscuration to origination etc.	1
For example, something, such as a wall which obscures light is described as an obscuration to eye-consciousness which is the effect of that [light].	1
In this way, thirty [instrumental] causes are explained 124 as the reverse of the thirty obscurations that pertain to these ten dharmas [i.e.	0
virtue etc.].	0
[2] In this respect, (a) the three causes for the origination of virtue are: applica- tion, application in regard to worthy objects and proper application.	1
Here now he provides an example: for example, the eyes etc.	1
For the eyes etc.	1
are just causes for the origination of consciousness, they do not cause continued existence etc.125 Therein, lack of application etc.	1
is an immediate obstruction to application etc.126, and indirectly, is an impediment to the origination of virtue too, on account of their mutual relationship, thus the obscuration to origination is an obscuration to virtue, hence he says: because of the necessity for the origination of the latter.	1
He shows that this is just an obscuration to origination because there is no possibility of continued existence in regard to virtue [if it has not originated].	1
[3] (b) The cause for continued existence is in relation to enlightenment.	1
The turning about of the basis is [equivalent to] enlightenment which has thusness, 121 Read: yaträrthe daśa kāraṇāni in place of yasminn arthe daśa kāraṇāni; cf.	0

It is unshakable because it remains for the duration of the world; it cannot become otherwise nor can it cease.	1
However, the enlightenment of the śrävaka etc.	1
ceases after having accomplished its aim in his own mental continuum.	1
The bodhisattvas who with their superior mental disposition which consists in the provision of welfare and happiness for all sentient beings are engaged in accumu- lations, vow to remain [in the world] up until such time as there is the enlightenment characterized by the turning about of the basis for [all] sentient beings ¹28; but not for the sake of mere non-rebirth, like the śrävakas etc.	1
129 Moreover, since there can be no continued existence without origination130, origination is also [applicable] here.	0
There- fore, just the cause for the continued existence of enlightenment is mentioned, not the cause for origination.	1
And since, there is no other cause for continued existence apart from this, consequently, only the latter is mentioned.	1
Alternatively, enlightenment is [equivalent to] pure thusness and thusness does not originate because it has purity for its own-being.	1
On the contrary, only continued existence is positively mentioned by way of these causes because of the absence of adventitious stain; origination is not [mentioned].	1
Furthermore, the causes for the continued existence of enlightenment¹31 are: (a) the production of the roots 132 of the wholesome, (b) mental attention and (c) accumulations that are complete.	1
And while such things as the non-origination of virtue are hindrances herein to the arising of the wholesome etc.	1
; since they impair the continued existence 133 of enlightenment, they are described as obscurations to its continued existence.	1
(b) The cause for continued existence¹34; here he gives an example: for example, the four types of food [are the cause for the con- tinued existence] of sentient beings, for no new sentient beings are brought into existence by means of the [four] foods such as morsel food135, whereas those who have already come into existence are certainly maintained 136.	0

For example, the inanimate world is [the cause for the support] of the world of sentient beings138.	1

The deprivation of a spiritual lineage etc.	1

Since they are impediments to the	1
like herein are described as obscurations to manifestation.	1
Hence he says: the obscu- ration to manifestation is [an obscuration] to the possession of intelli- gence because of the necessity for the promulgation of the latter.	1
Here now is an example: for example, sight is [the cause for the manifestation] of form 140; for sight141 is the cause for the manifestation of form alone, it is not the cause for origination and the like.	1
[6] The cause for modification is in relation to the absence of error.	1
Because it has the nature of the reverse of the errors of imputation and negation, the absence of error, which is [equivalent to the path of vision, is described as a modification of error¹42.	1
For example, ash etc.	1
[is a modification] of wood etc.	1
inversion, (b) the absence of the three obscurations such as moral defilement and (c) the maturation of the wisdom which brings liberation to fruition.	1

which seems confused: Mul pa med ni mthon ba'i lam mo // khrul pa med pa'i 'gyur ba źes bya ba ste (D230b.5).Y87 [7] The cause for disjunction is in relation to the absence of obscu- ration.	0
The obscuration that remains 143 from obscuration that is to be relinquished by means of the path of vision is relinquished on account of this, thus the absence of obscuration refers to the path of meditative development.	1
The three causes for the latter are: (a) the eradication of innate disquiet, (b) vigour¹44 and (c) the absence of careless- ness.	1
Moreover, these are causes for disjunction because they [act as] counteragents to the cause for non-disjunction.	1
Hence he says: the obscuration to disjunction is [an obscuration] to the absence of obscuration; and this is an obscuration to	1
because the latter consists in the separation from obscuration.	1
Since one is separated [from obscuration] on account of this, it is described as disjunction.	1
[8] The cause for transformation is in relation to development ¹45, because the latter is characterized by application in regard to the roots of the wholesome, i.e.	1
in regard to universal enlightenment.	1
Moreover, this consists in a turning aside from existence and enjoyments and the absence of faintheartedness.	1
Consequently, the obscuration to transformation should be regarded as an impediment to the cause for transformation.	1
For what reason?	1
Because the latter, i.e.	1
development, is char- acterized by the transformation of mind146 into universal enlightenment.	1
[9] The cause for belief is in relation to lack of fear.	1
This consists in: (a) the holding of people in esteem, (b) the firm conviction in the Dharma and (c) the understanding of the meaning that is intended.	1
Since belief is on account of these qualities, the obscuration to belief is [an obscuration] to lack of fear¹47, since [the latter] is an impediment to the cause for belief.	1
Here now is the reason148: because fear is due to disbelief because it is on account of disbelief that one has fear of the Dharma.	1
[10] The cause for making [others] believe is in relation to lack of avarice.	1
Moreover, this consists in: (a) enthusiasm for the true Dharma, (b) indiffer- ence towards gain and honour and veneration and (c) compassion for sentient beings.	1
And since it is at odds with the cause for making (others] believe, the obscuration to making (others] believe is established as [an obscuration]149 to lack of avarice.	1
Here now he provides the reason: because others are made to believe!	1

Moreover, one does not teach the Dharma to others because of avarice for the Dharma.	1
Hence the obscuration to making [others] believe is described as [an obscuration]151 to	0
[11] The three causes for attainment are152: (a) the absence of karma conducive to the loss of the Dharma, (b) much learning and (c) the necessary preparation for medita- tive concentration.	1
Loss of what is learnt etc.	1
is established as [an obscuration] to mastery because it is at odds with these [causes].	1
Here now is the reason: because the latter, i.e.	1
mastery, is characterized by the attainment of supremacy.	1
[12] However, others say that the causes for virtue etc.	1
have the following sequential order.	1
A mental continuum that is supported 153 by the wholesome dharmas is conducive to the attainment of enlightenment; consequently, virtue is mentioned at the beginning.	1
Immediately after that, enlightenment is mentioned.	1
Since [the bodhisattva) has the ability to accomplish both of these owing to his resolve for enlightenment and since his resolve for enlightenment is the support for all the wholesome dharmas until [he attains] enlightenment, the resolve for enlightenment is then mentioned.	1
When he has generated the resolve for enlightenment he applies himself to the six perfections as well as to the avoidance of stupid or pernicious people.	1
In this way his status as a bodhisattva becomes publicly manifest.	1
Hence his possession of intelligence is mentioned immediately after complete acceptance.	1
And while applying himself in this way [the bodhisattva] relinquishes erroneous inversion and produces direct intuition.	1
after this, the absence of obscuration is mentioned which consists in the relinquishment of obscuration.	1
Since the mind of one who is devoid of obscuration is transformed just into Buddhahood and not into any other [mode of being] because he is not attached to existence and enjoyments, consequently, development is then mentioned.	1
And thus, elation arises towards the extremely profound Dharmas of the Buddha on the part of [a bodhisattva] who has attained such a state of being and since he is devoid of fear, the lack of fear is then mentioned.	1
In this way, since one who has direct perception of the	1
discipline for sentient beings, how can there be any avarice on his part?	1
Therefore, immediately after lack of fear, lack of avarice is mentioned.	1

(d) The non-engendering of [the elements] conducive to liberation is [an obscuration] to the faculties.	1

(a) Lack of skill in regard to the foundation, (b) laziness etc.	1
The factors that contribute to enlightenment are common in this respect because both the śrävakas and bodhisattvas are entitled to them167 without a specific distinction [as to activity]168.	1
However, the perfections and the spiritual levels, which consist in the activity pertinent to the bodhisattvas, are not common [to all] because only the bodhisattvas have sovereign power over them.	1
Moreover, the obscuration to the result was previously described by way of the obscuration to the cause of virtue etc.	1

applications of mindfulness.	1
Moreover, this refers to the four applications of the mindfulness of: (a) budy, (b) sensation, (c) mind and (d) the dharmas.	1
The body, sensation, mind and the dharmas form the foundation of these [four applications of mindfulness] because they have these for their object.	1
Therein, the body forms the foundation for notional attachment to a '[physical] basis'.	1
Sensation forms the founda- tion for notional attachment to the enjoyments that belong to the self.	1
Mind forms the foundation for notional attachment to the belief in the self.	1
The dharmas171 form the foundation for notional attachment to the defilement and purification of the self.	1
Absence of understanding in regard to the individual and general characteristics of the body etc.	1
is [equivalent to] lack of skill in this regard.	0
Therein, the individual charac- teristic of the body refers to its nature as a composite of many impure substances ¹72.	1
The [individual characteristic] of sensation refers to its essential nature consisting in pleasure etc.	1
The individual characteristic] of consciousness refers to its various representations as sense-objects.	1
The [individual characteristic] of the dharmas is in accordance with the context [i.e.	1
pure or impure].	0
Furthermore, the general charac- teristic refers to the aspects such as impermanent, painful, empty and not-self.	1
Alter- natively, lack of skill in regard to the foundation refers either to: (a) lack of knowledge in regard to the body etc.	1
in its aspects as impure, painful, impermanent and without self, or (b) conceptual differentiation [in regard to the body etc.]	1
in terms of the aspects of purity, pleasure, permanence and a self, because nescience or wrong view are [respective] obscurations to the applications of mindfulness.	0
[Objection]: If the appli- cations of mindfulness have wisdom and mindfulness for their own-being, why is only	1
absence of memory in regard to the foundation?	1
[Response]: Because the activity [of mindfulness] is dependent upon wisdom; for thus, since wisdom consists in vision,	1

acts upon an objective support that is attained subsequently to wisdom but does not exist independently, like wisdom.	1
Therefore, the absence of memory is not described as an obscuration in this regard.	1
[3] Laziness is [an obscuration] to the complete relinquishments.	1
The topic under discussion is the obscurations.	1
Vigour receives the title of 'complete relin- quishment in this context when it is occupied with: (a) the relinquishment of adverse elements that have [already] arisen and the non-origination of those which have not yet arisen, and (b) the augmentation of the counteragent that has [already] arisen and the production of those which have not yet arisen.	1
Although the latter cannot be differen- tiated, they are respectively determined as fourfold due to the differentiation in	1
fulness is described as an obscuration.	1
[4] The two deficiencies in meditative concentration are [obscurations]	1
[the bodhisattva] becomes successful (rdhyate) by means of this.	1
Moreover, it consists in the meditative concentrations of will-power, vigour, mind and examination.	1
This is the base of psychic power because it is the support for the psychic powers such as travelling 174 through space and [the performance of] magical creations.	1
Alternatively, psychic power (rddhi) is [equivalent to] moving (ardana)175; what is meant is: a power such as traveling through space.	0
The bases of these are the bases of psychic power because they form its foundation.	1
The latter refers to meditative concentration and is of four kinds beginning with the meditative concentration of will-power.	1
Will-power is the essential feature in this meditative concentration of will-power because one attains meditative concentration by means of it.	1
However, it is not that vigour and the others are absent therein for they do accompany will-power, but since they are not essential features in the latter [i.e.	1
in the chandasamadhi], they are not proclaimed.	1
The same should be said for the meditative concentrations of vigour, mind and examination.	1
The two deficiencies in meditative concentration were described as obscurations and since these are not known, he says: namely, (a) [a deficiency] in completeness 176 due to defectiveness in either will-power, vigour, mind or examination and (b) [a deficiency] in meditative development due to defectiveness in the formative forces that facilitate relinquishment.	0
The deficiency in com- pleteness in this regard is due to the absence of any one of: will-power, vigour, mind and examination, because meditative concentration does not occur due to the power of	1

As to the deficiency in meditative development, this is due to the absence of any one of the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment.	1
More- over, the latter have the nature of faith, will-power, vigour, tranquillity, mindfulness, full awareness, volition and equanimity Since mastery in meditative concentration is obtained by means of the meditative development of these formative forces that facilitate relinquishment and not by any other means, hence, because there is a deficiency in meditative development due to their absence, mastery over meditative development is not obtained.	1

and (b) secondary defilement that is adverse to the formative forces which facilitate relinquishment, namely, laziness, forgetfulness in regard to an objective support, indolence, excitability, the absence of formative force and the [presence of] formative force.	1
[5] The non-engendering of [the elements] conducive to liberation is [an obscuration] to the faculties.	1
The root of the wholesome which one who is afraid of samsāra179 produces for the sake of liberation is described as 'conducive to liberation' since the assurance of obtaining liberation is on account of that.	1
And since faith etc.	1
receive the title of 'faculties' when it is engendered and not otherwise, hence ¹80 the non-engendering of [the roots of the wholesome] that are conducive to liberation is described as the obscuration to the faculties.	1
What are the obscurations here?	1
They are that: (a) attachment to a new existence and (b) fear in regard to nirvana.	1
[which occur when the root of the wholesome] which is conducive to liberation is not generated on account of any secondary defilement 181.	0
[6] The excessive weakness of those faculties is [an obscuration] to the powers.	1
The topic under discussion is obscuration.	1
182 How then can there be an excessive weakness of the faculties?	1
Consequently, he says: because of their contamination ¹83 by adverse elements; what is meant is: they are overcome by adverse elements which have the nature of lack of faith, laziness, loss of mindful- ness, distraction and a weakness in wisdom 185.	0

181Y93 of 'heat' and the state of the 'summit'186; and although these two [states] are conducive to penetration, they become excessively weak because they are overcome by adverse elements such as lack of faith.	1
Hence there is the possibility of loss through that187.	1
However faith and the like receive the title of 'powers' in the states 188 of the 'receptivity to knowledge and the highest [worldly]189 realization' because the adverse elements have been vanquished.	1
Hence whatever excessive weakness there is in those [faculties] such as faith, when they are overcome by adverse elements in the states of 'heat' and the 'summit'190, that is an obstruction to the powers because when it exists there is no possibility of a condition of power191.	1
What are the obscurations here?	1
Just those adverse [elements] such as lack of faith.	1
[7] The fault of false view is [an obscuration] to the limbs of enlight- enment.	1
The fact that obscuration [is the subject under discussion] remains in force here ¹92, Enlightenment here is intended as [equivalent to the path of vision and since these seven limbs of enlightenment which have the nature of mindfulness, the investi- gation of the Dharma, vigour, joy, tranquillity, meditative concentration and equanimity arise at the time of the relinquishment of moral defilement that is to be relinquished by means of [the path of] vision, they are described as the limbs of the latter¹93 [i.e.	1
of enlightenment].	0
However, if they were [described as] limbs because they are favourable to enlightenment then the applications of mindfulness and the like would also be limbs of enlightenment.	1
How can the fault of false view be an obscuration to the limbs of enlightenment?	1
Hence he says: because they are nurtured by the path of vision; what is meant is: because they are respectively determined by the path of vision.	1
What then is this fault of false view?	1
(a) The five imaginary views, (b) doubt, (c) ignorance, (d) the moral defilements and secondary defilements together with their associates such as passion, which have the latter [i.e.	1
a, b & c] for their objective support.	0

doubt etc.]	1
is not contradictory.	1
Moreover, of these [elements] beginning with false view, it is just the 'seed' lodged in the store-consciousness that is described as an obscuration to those [limbs of enlight- enment] because it is to be relinquished 196 by means of the path of vision.	1
[8] The fault of disquiet is mentioned as the obscuration to the limbs of the path, which are enumerated as: correct view, correct intention, correct speech, correct action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness and correct meditative concentration 197.	1
Here now he provides the reason: because those limbs of the path are characterized by the path of meditative development, because they are respectively determined by the path of meditative development.	1
What is the fault of disquiet?	1
In detail it refers to: (a) the innate false views of individuality and grasping of extremes together with their associated elements and (b) the moral defilements and secondary defilements of passion etc.	1
together with their associated elements, which have the former [i.e.	1
(a)] as well as the sense-objects for their objective supports.	1
The 'seed' of these, which is lodged in the store-consciousness, is disquiet.	1
However, in brief, it refers to the impurities other than those which are to be relinquished by means of [the path of] vision.	1
The force of those [impurities], which is lodged in the store- consciousness, is disquiet.	1
Moreover, this is determined as an obscuration to the limbs of the path since it is to be relinquished by means of the path of meditative develop- ment.	1
The obscuration to the factors that contribute to enlightenment has now been described.	1

The Obscurations to the Perfections.	1
The obscurations to the perfections are: II.12 abcd Obscurations to: (a) dominion, (b) propitious states of existence, (c) the non-abandonment of sentient beings, (d) the diminution of faults and aug- mentation of virtues, (e) guidance;	0

Here the obscurations that pertain to the ten perfections are shown by way of the particular obscuration to the relevent result of each perfection.	1
Of these, (a) the obscuration to dominion and sovereignty is an obscuration [to the result]198 of the perfection of generosity.	1
(b) The obscuration to propitious states of existence is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of morality.	1
(c) be obscuration to the non-abandonment of sentient beings is [an obscuration to the result] of the perfection of patience.	1
(d) The obscuration to the diminution of faults and the augmentation of virtues is [an obscuration to the result] of the perfection of vigour.	1
(e) The obscuration to the guidance of those to be trained is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of the meditative absorptions.	1
(f) The obscuration to liberation is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of wisdom.	1
(g) The obscu- ration to the imperishability of generosity etc.	1
is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of skill in regard to expedients because its imperishability is on account of the transformation into enlightenment.	1
(h) The obscuration to the uninterrupted emergence of the wholesome in all rebirths is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of vows because the possession of a rebirth that is favourable to this is on account of the strength of vows.	1
(i) The obscuration to the assurance [of the arising] of those wholesome [elements] is [an obscuration to the result] of the perfection of the powers because [the bodhisattva] is not overcome by adverse elements on account of his powers of critical consideration and meditative development.	1
() The obscuration to both the enjoyment of the Dharma for himself and causing the maturation of others is an obscuration [to the result of the perfection of direct intu- ition because the understanding [by the bodhisattva] of the meaning of what he has learnt is not in accord with the letter.	1
[1] Immediately following the latter [i.e.	1
the obscurations to the factors that contribute to enlightenment], [the obscurations] to the perfections should be mentioned.	1
Hence he	1

etc.	0
Here the obscurations that pertain to the ten perfections are shown by way of the particular obscuration to the relevent result of each perfec- tion.	1
What is the reason that here avarice and the like, which exist substantially as impediments 200 to generosity etc., are not described as obscurations to the perfections although they are [described as] obscurations to the result of the relevent (perfection]?	1
All [people] engage in generosity and the like for the sake of its result201; therefore, in order to generate interest in the relinquishment of avarice etc., the obscuration to the result is mentioned but the obscuration to the perfection not.	1
Alternatively, obscura- tion such as avarice which is adverse to dominion and which produces a result consisting in poverty etc., impedes a result such as dominion202, thus it is described as an obscuration to the latter.	1
What are the results of those [perfections]?	1
In this respect the chief results of the perfection of generosity are dominion and sovereignty.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of morality is a propitious state of existence.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of patience is the non-aban- donment of sentient beings.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of vigour is the diminution of faults and the augmentation of virtues.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of meditative absorption is guidance for sentient beings in scriptural instruction.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of wisdom is liberation for those who have been guided203.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of skill in regard to expedients is the imperishability of the wholesome on account of its transfor- mation into enlightenment.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of vows is uninter- rupted virtue.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of the powers is the assurance [of the arising] of wholesome dharmas.	1
The [chief result] of the perfection of direct intuition is the enjoyment of the Dharma and the maturation of sentient beings.	1

Sovereignty refers to the power that comes from the enjoyment of the latter.	1
The obscuration to these two is an obscuration pertinent to the perfection of generosity because they result from that.	1
What then is this [obscuration]?	1
It is avarice.	1
[3] The obscuration to the propitious states of existence; a propitious state of existence refers to an excellent state of existence either among mankind or the gods205.	1
The obscuration to this is an obscuration pertinent to the perfection of moral- ity because [propitious states of existence] result from that.	1
Moreover, this [obscuration] consists in: (a) immorality and (b) contemptible actions of body and speech.	1

[5] [The obscuration] to the diminution of faults and the augmentation of virtues; the diminution of faults refers to the relinquishment of [elements] that have already arisen which cause harm to oneself and others and the non-origination of [elements] that have not yet arisen.	1

It is laziness.	1
[6] The obscuration to the guidance of those to be trained...; i.e.	1

[8] The obscuration to the imperishability of generosity etc.210; an obscu- ration to the imperishability of generosity and morality etc.	1
is an obscuration pertinent to the perfection of expedients.	1
Moreover, as to how generosity etc.	1
can be imperish- able, he says: because its imperishability is on account of the transfor- mation into enlightenment.	1
The root of the wholesome such as generosity which is transformed into universal enlightenment, like Buddhahood, does not perish,.	1
Some believe that this obscuration consists in a lack of knowledge of the expedients which characterize the transformation into universal enlightenment.	1
Others believe that this obscuration consists in the grasping of the three components [of giving]211 which is	1
in all rebirths; the uninterrupted [emergence] of the wholesome is [equivalent to its emergence] day by day or moment by moment.	1
And this is the result of the perfection of vows.	1
As to why this is so, he says: because the possession²	1
bodhisattva] takes a rebirth that is congenial to the uninterrupted emergence of generosity etc.	1
through the strength of his vows.	1
Obscuration to this consists in the absence of vows in relation to a rebirth favourable to generosity etc.	1
[10] The obscuration to the assurance214 [of the arising] of those whole- some [elements]; assurance consists in the combining [of the three: vīrya, samadhi and prajñāļ215 day by day and moment by moment.	1
Here now he gives the reason: because [the bodhisattva] is not overcome by adverse [elements] on account of his powers of critical consideration and meditative develop- ment.	1
The power of critical consideration here consists in wisdom accompanied by steadfastness.	1
Furthermore, steadfastness is a designative dharma since it is a designa- tion applicable to the innate trio of vigour216, meditative concentration and wisdom.	1
The power of meditative development [is mentioned here] because [the bodhisattva) engages in generosity etc., effortlessly, through his possession of habitual practice	1

What are the obscurations here?	1
(a) The absence of critical consideration217 and (b) weakness in meditative development.	1
[11] The obscuration to the enjoyment of the Dharma for himself and causing the maturation of others; the results are: (a) the enjoyment of the profound and sublime Dharma of the universal vehicle by one who is situated in the circles of the assembly which pertain to enjoyment218 and (b) causing the maturation 219 of sentient beings through teaching the Dharma by acts of transformation in their various aspects220.	1
Moreover, the obscurations to this are: (a) deliberation upon the meaning of what has been learnt, according to the letter221 and (b) sluggish wisdom.	1
[12] Although, substantially there are six perfections herein, nominally there are ten²22 since four perfections are constituted by the perfection of wisdom.	1
The perfection of wisdom therein consists in supramundane direct intuition devoid of conceptual differ- entiation; the gradual relinquishment of all obscuration is on account of that direct intuition.	1
Furthermore, the perfections of expedients, vows, the powers and direct intuition are incorporated in direct intuition that is attained subsequently to the supra- mundane path.	1
How is it that the perfection of direct intuition, although it is pre- eminent, is not devoid of conceptual differentiation?	1
Because the perfection of direct intuition consists in that direct intuition attained subsequently to the direct intuition that	1
means of that direct intuition223, [the bodhisattva] experiences in return the enjoyment of the Dharma for himself and brings others to maturation.	1
And since this duality [i.e.	1
self/others subject/object] is non-existent in [direct intuition] devoid of conceptual differentiation, consequently, the perfection of direct intuition is not without conceptual differentiation.	0
The obscurations to the perfections have now been described.	1

Moreover, [the obscurations] to the spiritual levels are, respectively:	0
pervading, (b) the meaning as pre- eminent, (c) the meaning as pre- eminent that flows out, (d) the meaning as devoid of possession, (e) [the meaning] as non-differentiation	1
II.14 abcd II.15 abcd II.16 abcd (f) The meaning as devoid of defile- ment and purification, (g) the mean- ing as devoid of multiplicity, (h) the meaning as neither diminished nor increased and (i) the basis of the four kinds of mastery.	0
This ignorance concerning the dharmadhātu, being a tenfold obscu- ration which is undefiled, [acts] in opposition to the ten spiritual levels.	1
However, the spiritual levels are the counteragents.	1
Concerning the dharmadhãātu, there is undefiled nescience in regard to the tenfold meaning, such as all-pervading, which is an obscuration to the ten respective spiritual levels of the bodhisattva because it is adverse to each of them, namely, "in regard to the meaning as all- pervading" 224 [and so on as above].	1
For, (a) by means of the first spiritual level [the bodhisattva] penetrates the sense of all-pervading on the part of the dharmadhātu; on account of this he obtains in return [the realization] that self and others are equal.	1
(b) By means of the second	1
believes: "therefore then, in regard to equality in achievement, endeavour should be directed by us towards only the achievement of complete purification in every way"225.	0
(c) By means of the third [he penetrates] the meaning as pre-eminent that flows out of that [dharmadhātu].	1
On account of this, after understanding the pre-eminent	1

may cast himself into a fire-pit the size of the great trichiliocosm for the sake of them.	1
(d) By means of the fourth [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of possession, for thus, even his craving for the Dharma is checked.	1
(e) By means of the fifth [he penetrates] its meaning as non-	1
regard to the purity of mind and mental disposition.	1
(f) By means of the sixth [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of defilement and purity as the consequence of his penetration [of the reality] that, regarding the	1
that is defiled or purified.	1
(g) By means of the seventh [he penetrates]	1
manifestation of multiplicity by way of sign in the dharmas of the Sutras etc.	1
on account of their signlessness.	1
(h) By means of the eighth	1
consequence of his acquisition of patient acceptance in regard to non- originating dharmas since, in regard to defilement and purification, he fails to perceive either the diminution or augmentation of any dharma whatsoever 227.	0
(i) Mastery is fourfold: (a) mastery over the absence of conceptual differentiation, (b) mastery over the complete purification of the field, (c) mastery over direct intuition and (d) mastery over karma.	1
In this respect, by means of just the eighth spiritual level he penetrates	1
second masteries.	1
On the ninth [he penetrates the reality that it forms the basis for mastery over direct intuition due to his acquisition of analytical knowledge.	1
On the tenth [he penetrates the reality that it forms the basis for mastery over karma as the consequence of his working for the welfare of sentient beings at will through his creative transformations.	1

Others believe that in whichever state (vihāra) the bodhisattva dwells (viharati) for an extended period in regard to [his understanding] of the dharmadhātu in the sense of all-pervading etc., by virtue of the fact that he abides in that particular state it is called a spiritual level.	1
Furthermore, the arrangement of the spiritual levels231 [is as follows]: On the Joyous, the bodhisattva achieves the direct realization of the Dharma due to the arising of the path of vision.	1
On the Stainless, [the bodhisattva] who has achieved the direct realization of the Dharma232 accomplishes a special training consisting in a superior morality that flows spontaneously because of his abstention from the immorality that stems from all subtle transgressions.	1
On the Radiance Giving, he accomplishes a special training that consists in a superior mentality in regard to both the Dharma and karma that does not cease even in other rebirths.	1
On the Brilliant, the Very Difficult to Conquer and the	1
enment, (b) the [noble] truths and (c) dependent origination.	1
These latter trainings should be understood to have four kinds of result on the [four] remaining spiritual levels: Of these, on the Far Reaching he accomplishes with effort233 the state of the direct intuition of the signless.	1
On the Immovable, he accomplishes without effort the state of the direct intuition of the signless together with the purification of the 'field'.	1
On the Good Discernment, he accomplishes the special quality of analytical knowledge and it is on account of this that he preaches the Dharma234.	1

[2] Concerning the dharmadhātu,...in regard to the tenfold meaning such as all-pervading, 235...	0
The sense of all-pervading etc.	1
in regard to the dharmadhātu is understood by way of the ten spiritual levels of the bodhisattva.	1
Undefiled nescience in regard to that [meaning] is a tenfold obscuration to the ten respective spiritual levels of the bodhisattva because it is adverse to each of them, i.e.	1
because it is adverse to each of the spiritual levels; for the spiritual levels consist in special states236 of supramundane meditative concentration and wisdom etc.	1
Undefiled nescience is adverse [to these states] because it impedes their arising.	1
Moreover, it is not just undefiled nescience that is an obscuration in this context, on the contrary, other moral defilements and secondary defilements are [obscurations] as well.	0
For thus, everything on the Joyous [level] to be relinquished by the path of vision is an obscuration because all propensities for wrong insight in regard to the [noble] truths are relinquished by the path of vision which brings about an understanding237 of the sense of all-pervading.	1
Furthermore, those [propensities] to be relinquished through meditative development [are done so] by way of the remaining spiritual levels.	1
However, those [propensities] that have not been relinquished are just like the ones that have been relinquished since they do not cause defilement on the part of the bodhisattvas.	1
With reference to this very matter, a verse has been composed: Moral defilement becomes a limb of enlightenment for one who employs the	1
nature of appeasement.	1
Consequently, the	1
Moreover, because of the statement: "on the ten spiritual levels the ten perfections are successively more excellent", it is evident that there is also the successive relinquish- ment of those elements, beginning with avarice, which are adverse to each [level].	1
[Objection]: If other238 moral defilement may also be an obscuration, why is only undefiled nescience described as the obscuration to the spiritual levels?	1
[Response]: Because it is not common to everyone since it acts as an impediment239 to the attain- ment of nirvāṇa only for bodhisattvas, but not for śrävakas etc.	0
Thus, the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas become liberated in spite of its [i.e.	1

ment applies equally to bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc., the fact that [undefiled nescience] is an obscuration is not annulled even though there is no mention of it [in other works] since it is not posited nor rejected as an obscuration to the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva, considering that it is described as an obscuration to the spiritual levels and that it is not the only obscuration to the spiritual levels.	0
Others say that since undefiled nescience pertains equally to the bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc., it is mentioned especially as an obscuration to the spiritual levels; however, moral defile- ment follows as a consequence therefore it is not mentioned.	1
[Reply]: Although moral defilement is indeed equally applicable to the bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc.	0
it therefore need not necessarily follow.	0
Others again believe240 that although the obscuration consisting in the nescience of the spiritual levels is an undefiled nescience pertinent to the śrävakas, it does not act as an impediment to liberation because the śrävakas become liberated even though the nescience in regard to the spiritual levels is present.	1
However, [such a nescience] is defiled for the bodhisattva since it is the cause of an impediment to the attainment of nirvana.	1
[3] Others believe this is not so: II.16b Being a tenfold obscuration that is undefiled.	1
Because, by means of the first spiritual level [the bodhisattva] pene- trates the sense of all-pervading on the part of the dharmadhātu.	1
Therein, the first spiritual level refers to the first supramundane wisdom, together with its associated elements and is incorporated in the path of vision.	1
The dharmadhatu is [equivalent to] emptiness since, by virtue of its being a universal characteristic, it is in one place just as it is everywhere.	1
It is all-pervading because it extends everywhere.	1
The statement: "since no dharma is to be found outside the dharmadhâtu"241, shows that the dharmadhātu is all-pervading.	1
By "penetrates" is meant: 'realizes'.	1
On account of that242 penetration he obtains in return [the realization] that self and others are equal243.	1
As the consequence of his insight into the fact that the emptiness in regard to self and others cannot be differentiated, he reflects upon the fact that self and others are not different [thinking]: "what is self is other", or "what is other is self".	1
It is only because of this that the perfection of generosity is more excellent on this spiritual level, consequently, on this [level] the bodhisattva is just as occupied with	0

(4] By means of the second [he penetrates] its meaning as foremost; the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharmadhātu is understood.	1
This is due to his vision of its intrinsic luminosity.	1
On account of that he believes: "therefore then, in regard to equality in achievement245, endeavour should be directed by us towards only the achievement of complete purification in every way"; he demonstrates scriptural tradition by this statement for it is said in the [Daśabhūmika] Sūtra: Because, when these246 ten wholesome paths of action are cultivated in the aspect of wisdom, ...they lead up to the śrävaka vehicle.	0
Then, when they are purified to a greater degree, ...they lead up to the pratyekabuddha vehicle.	1
Then, when they are purified even more247, ...they lead to: (a) the complete purity of the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva, (b) the complete purity 248 of the perfec- tions and (c) extensiveness in courses.	1
Then, when they are purified to a greater degree, they lead up to the force of the ten powers 249 since they are completely purified in every way250...	1
Therefore then, in regard to equality in achievement [endeavour should be directed by us...].251 The words "therefore then etc."	1
signify that since [the bodhisattva] has this thought on the second spiritual level, therefore it is known that he penetrates the meaning [of the dharmadhatu] as foremost by way of the second [level].	1
"Achievement" is [equivalent to] effort or deed.	1
"Complete purification in every way" is [equivalent to] the removal of both defiled and undefiled delusion in regard to the dharmadhātu.	1
Consequently, the perfection of morality is more excellent on this spiritual level because the self becomes, still more so, a fit vessel252 [for purity 1253 on account of the desire for the pre-eminent meaning [of the dharmadhātu].	0

because the statements of the Buddha are characterized by their penetration of the dharmadhâtu; for thus254, the Dharma teachings such as the Sūtras which flow out of the dharmadhātu are characterized by the power of the dharmadhātu known as the Dharma Body which is completely pure in every way.	1
This is because of both the pre- eminent nature of the Dharma teachings that flow out of that255 [dharmadhātu] and also the fact that they [i.e.	0
the Dharma teachings] are the cause of the complete purification of the dharmadhâtu on account of the pre-eminent nature of the dharmadhatu.	1

possession 269.	0
It is understood that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharma- dhātu.	1
On the fourth spiritual level, because of its evenness, he penetrates [the meaning] of the dharmadhātu as an absence of what pertains to the self, since there is no sense of 'mine' whatsoever on the part of the dharmadhātu270.	0
Alternatively, [the dharmadhātu] is not in the possession of anyone because it is not an object of all erroneous inversion; since it is free from erroneous inversion in itself, there is no possession whatsoever on its behalf.	1
For thus271, even his craving for the Dharma is checked; this is a statement from scriptural tradition.	1
In this way, due to his understanding of the dharmadhātu272 through direct intuition free from conceptual elaboration, he acquires the dharmas consisting in the factors that contribute to enlight- enment on the Brilliant [level] and even that craving for the Dharma of the Sūtras etc.	1
which existed previously on the part of the bodhisattva, is checked.	1
Others believe that the craving for the Dharma refers to meditative absorption, meditative concentration and the attainments.	1
Therefore, on this spiritual level the perfection of vigour is more excellent because [the bodhisattva] dwells perpetually in company with the factors that contribute to enlightenment273 when both speech and discursive thought have been transcended.	1

By reason of the ten equalities in regard to the purity of mind and mental disposi- tion279; he demonstrates scriptural tradition by this statement.	0
[The full passage reads as follows]:280 By reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the Dharma of the Buddhas of the past, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the Dharma of the Buddhas of the future281, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the Dharma of the Buddhas of the present, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning morality, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning mind 282, reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the removal of false view, doubt, perplexity and annoyance, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the knowledge of what is the path and what is not the path, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the knowledge of spiritual practice and renunciation283, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposi- tion concerning the ever increasing development of all dharmas that contribute to enlightenment284 and by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the maturation of all sentient beings 285.	0
[The bodhisattva] penetrates 286 the non-differentiation in mental continuum by reason of these equalities because the Dharma Body, which is characterized287 by a turning about of the store-consciousness, is undifferentiated.	1
Therefore, on this spiritual level the perfection of meditative absorption is more excellent due to the abundance of meditative development in regard to the aspects of the [noble] truths, in an absolute sense.	1

The characteristic of dependent origination is defilement.	1
The [dharmadhātu] is not intrinsically defiled because [defilement] is adventitious to it, nor is it purified because it is intrinsically pure.	1
Thus he penetrates the dharmadhātu in the form of being understood in himself through direct intuition that is free from conceptual differentiation.	1
Here now he demonstrates scriptural tradition: as the consequence of his penetration2 288 [of the reality] that, regarding depend- ent origination, there is no dharma whatsoever that is defiled or purified.	0
On the sixth spiritual level the bodhisattva analyses dependent origination and penetrates [the reality] in regard to the latter that no dharma whatsoever is defiled or purified, because: (a) the dharmadhātu is luminous by nature, (b) defilement is only pertinent to the limbs of dependent origination and (c) with the exception of the latter289	0
purity can be construed.	1
It is only because of this that290 the perfection of wisdom is more excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva] understands the profoundness of dependent origination in the sense of the absence of defilement and purity.	1
multiplicity; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharmadhātu that is referred to.	1
On this spiritual level the bodhisattva is victorious due to the absence of the manifestation of all signs.	1
And since multiplicity manifests by way of the mani- festation of signs, hence it is said that by means of the seventh [level] he penetrates the	1
festation of signs.	1
In order to demonstrate this very meaning, he says: because of the absence of the manifestation of multiplicity by way of sign in the dharmas of the Sūtras etc291.	1
Up to the sixth spiritual level [the bodhisattva] enters the dharmadhātu by means of the signs of the dharmas [explained in the Sūtras etc., [signs] which manifest themselves forcefully in their diversity as the [two] know- ledges, i.e.	1
that which consists in the entry into [the dharmadhātu] and that which is obtained subsequently to the latter.	1
However, on the seventh spiritual level, since he	0

Consequently, on this spiritual level the perfection of expedients is more	1

dict conventional linguistic usage which is created by signs.	1
Also, as the consequence of his penetration of the latter, in this [level] he obtains supremacy 292 [10] By means of the eighth [he penetrates] its meaning as neither diminished nor increased 293; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharmadhatu that is referred to, since the dharmadhātu is completely pure by nature because there is no difference between its stained or stainless condition.	1
It is because of this that it is described as thusness (tathata)considering that it is eternally just thus (tathā).	1
Even though it is devoid of sign it does not diminish294; even though it possesses sign it does not increase 295; for thus some believe that the sign itself is sign- less.	1
Here now he gives the reason: as the consequence of his acquisition of	1
eighth spiritual level the bodhisattva penetrates the fact that there is neither diminution nor increase on the part of the dharmadhatu because he acquires patient acceptance in regard to non-originating dharmas.	1
In regard to defilement and purification, there is neither a diminution nor augmentation of any dharmas whatso- ever296, because there can be no origination of new dharmas.	1
[11] Mastery is fourfold: (a) mastery over the absence of conceptual differentiation, (b) mastery over the complete purification of the 'field', (c) mastery over direct intuition and (d) mastery over karma.	1
Because of the spontaneous absence of the manifestation of all signs therein, the dharmadhātu is to be known as the basis for mastery over direct intuition297 devoid of conceptual differ- entiation.	1
Even on the seventh [level] the non-manifestation of signs is possible by way of formative influence; however, here [on the eighth level] [it is possible] by way of the absence of formative influence [i.e.	0
spontaneously 1298 that is the difference.	0
Also, by means of the eighth [he penetrates the reality] that it is the basis for mastery over the complete purification of the 'field'; the topic under discussion is the fact that he penetrates [this reality] of the dharmadhātu 299.	1

Since, on this level, he acquires analytical knowledge consisting in: (a) the Dharma, (b) meaning, (c) grammatical analysis and (d) a ready intellect, which are not obtained by others.	1
Hence here, it is discermed that the penetration of the dharmadhātu is the basis of mastery over direct intuition.	1
Therefore, the perfection of the powers is more excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva] possesses the special power of wisdom.	1
[13] By means of the tenth303 [he penetrates the reality] that it forms the basis of mastery over karma; it is the fact that he penetrates [this reality of the dharmadhātu] that is referred to.304 How is this understood?	1
Hence he says: as the consequence of his working for the welfare of sentient beings at will through his creative transformations.	1
Through this resolve 305 on the tenth spiritual level [the bodhisattva] penetrates [the reality] that the dharmadhātu is the basis of mastery over karma.	1
On account of this he obtains supremacy in regard to the actions of a tathāgata.	1
For thus, like the sugata, through his Transformation Bodies he acts at will doing what is to be done at the appropriate time306 for the sentient beings abiding in the infinite world-spheres of the ten directions.	1
Therefore, the perfection of direct intuition is more excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva]	1

[14] In this way the ten spiritual levels of the bodhisattva are respectively determined as the counteragents to undefiled nescience which is an obscuration to each single spiritual level and is also an impediment to the complete purification, in every respect, [which facilitates] the tenfold penetration of the dharmadhatu and which is relevant to these spiritual levels of the bodhisattva as has [just] been described.	1
The peculiar nature of the ninth and tenth spiritual levels is revealed through their results but not through a peculiar penetration of a different objective support307, because [the bodhisattva] in these states reaches a condition which cannot be defined.	1
The purpose of the penetration of the meaning of all-pervading etc.	1
is [for the attainment of] a state of excellence of the ten perfections, respectively, on the ten spiritual levels.	1
Therefore, these obscurations to the spiritual levels that have been described are also said to be obscurations to the state of excellence of the perfections.	1
Alternatively, it is said in a Sūtra that the purpose of penetrating308 the meaning [of the dharmadhātu] as all- pervading etc.	1
is [to attain] the result such as the attainment of meditative concentration which is distinguished by [the attainment of] ever-increasing spiritual levels and which culminates in direct intuition in regard to all aspects.	1

[Sthiramati] Y107.7 [1] All the obscurations, which are of various kinds, have been described in the above.	1
In order to demonstrate that they are [all] included within two obscurations, he says:	0
II.17 ab Obscuration that consists in moral defilement and obscuration that con- sists in the knowable has now been elucidated.	1
As to how this is understood that in total there are only two and that a third does not exist, he says: II.17 c These are all the obscurations in this regard.	0
The ellipsis is that [all] are included 309.	0
It is understood that all curation is included within the two obscurations; another, i.e.	1
a third, does not exist.	1
Consequently, all obscuration is included herein, hence liberation from all obscuration is con- sidered as being due to the extinction of this twofold obscuration, consisting in both moral defilement and the knowable which comprise all obscuration.	1
What is meant is: one should relinquish all obscuration ³10.	1
[2] Although obscuration to the Buddha level has not been elucidated, is it also included in these [two]?	0
[It is included, however] its inclusion is not due to its direct mention but rather is due to its intrinsic nature.	1
Moreover, it has certainly been mentioned because of the statements about the pervading obscuration; otherwise it would be just a limited obscuration.	1
Alternatively, in order to include³11 the obscu- ration to the Buddha level, he says: II.17 cd These are all the obscurations in this regard.	0
Liberation is considered as being due to their extinction³12.	1
Because there can be no liberation in the absence of the extinction of the obscuration to the Buddha leve!.	0
Hence it has been illustrated that the latter [i.e.	1
obscuration to the Buddha level] is also an obscuration, just like the remaining obscurations.	1
However, undefiled nescience which is a condition of extraordinary subtlety and the latent impressions of moral defilement are described as obscurations to the Buddha level.	1
Therefore, it has been elucidated in this way because it cannot be examined differently due to its extraordinary subtlety.	1

Ms.(33a.2): -ävaraṇam yat; disregard Y's fn.6 p.108.Chapter Three Reality With reference to reality, he says: III.1 abcd III.2 abcd Introductory [Sthiramati] There is: (a) basic reality, (b) the reality of characteristic, (c) that	0
neous inversion, (d) the reality that consists cause and result and (e) that of the gross and the subtle; (f) Well-established reality, (g) the reality of the sphere of purity, (h) the reality of the aggregation, (i) that which is characterized by differen- tiation and (j) the tenfold reality of the skills which [act] in opposition to the false view of self.	1
There are ten kinds of reality, namely, (a) the basic reality, (b) the reality of characteristic, (c) the reality free from erroneous inversion, (d) the reality of cause and result, (e) the reality of the gross and the subtle, (f) well-established reality, (g) the reality of the sphere of purity, (h) the reality of the aggregation, (i) the reality of differentiation and (j) the reality of the skills.	1
Moreover, the latter [which act] as the counteragents to the ten kinds of self-grasping should be understood as being tenfold, namely, skill in the aggregates, skill in the elements, skill in the sense-fields, skill in dependent origination, skill in the possible and the impossible, skill in the sense faculties, skill in the times, skill in the [four] truths, skill in the vehicles and skill in the conditioned and the unconditioned.	1
[1] Immediately following the explanation of the obscurations is the appropriate place for the explanation of reality since it was listed immediately after [the obscurations].	1
Hence [Vasubandhu] says: with reference to reality, [Maitreyal says...	0
There are various kinds of reality, consequently, without an understanding of their differen-Y111 tiation the essential nature of the realities is difficult to understand.	0
Hence, in order to clearly illustrate the differentiation of the realities at the beginning, he says: III.1 a There is: (a) basic reality, (b) the reality of characteristic etc.	0
[2] [Some say] the statement about the basic reality is for the sake of showing that the other realities are included there within the basic reality.	1
The statement about the reality of characteristic is for the sake of overcoming the faults that have entered into clear comprehension, relinquishment and realization in regard to basic reality.	1
The statement about the reality free from erroneous inversion is for the sake of demonstrating the expedients for withdrawal from samsāra.	1
The statement about the reality of cause and result is for the sake of showing the 'going forth'	1
the śrävaka goes forth by virtue of his penetration of the four noble truths and (his progress in] meditative development.	1
The statement about the reality of the gross	1
aspects.	1
The statement about the reality of the subtle is for the sake of showing the expedients for the relinquishment of all obscuration.	1
The statement about well- established reality is: (a) for the sake of showing the expedients which facilitate the explanation of the extremely well-defined³ Dharma and (b) for the sake of showing the expedients for the refutation of all counter-arguments.	1
The statement about the real- ity of the sphere of purity is for the sake of showing the differences in purity according to its differentiation with regard to spiritual lineage, sense faculty and mental disposition, although equal [i.e.	1
non-differentiated] with regard to the dharmadhātu.	0
The statement about the reality of aggregation is for the sake of showing the expedients for entry into defilement and purity in all aspects.	1
The statement about the reality of differentiation is for the purpose of showing the capacity for reversal of all uncertainty, beginning with funcertainty in regard to] thusness.	1
The statement about the reality of the skills is for the sake of showing the expedients for the estab- lishment of non-substantiality after having checked self-grasping, in all its modes.	1
In detail, there are ten kinds of reality.	1
[3] However, others say that the basic reality, which is pertinent to bodhisattvas, is not common [to the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas].	1
The second reality is the counteragent	1

The tenth reality refers to the eradication of the root of defilement.	1
[4] In brief, these ten realities are the basis of all the statements of the tathāgatas with hidden meaning.	1
In detail, reality is immeasurable.	1
Some believe that because it is conformable with reality the conventional too is described as a reality in this context.	1
Others believe that these are all realities because they are not disconsonant with the modes as described, considering that, that which is not disconsonant with a particular mode, is a reality as such.	1
In the above, the basic reality refers to: III.3 a The three natures; [Namely], the imaginary, the other-dependent and the perfected, because the other realities are respectively determined in relation to these.	1

[Sthiramati] Y111.19 [1] In the above, the basic reality refers to: III.3 a The three natures etc.	0
Since these have not been established, he says: the imaginary, the other- dependent and the perfected.	1
In order to demonstrate the reason why the three natures are described as comprising the basic reality, he says: because the other realities are respectively determined in relation to these.	1
What is meant is: the other realities, such as that of characteristic, are included within that [basic reality).	1
[2] Why should these three natures be studied?	1
Some believe that it is in order to demonstrate: (a) conventional usage, (b) the absolute and (c) the basis of the latter.	1
Others believe it is in order to demonstrate: (a) erroneous inversion, (b) the cause of that and (c) the objective support that acts as the counteragent to these.	1
Others believe it is in order to demonstrate the foundation of: (a) relinquishment, (b) clear comprehen- sion and (c) realization so as to facilitate separation from obscurations on the part of the bodhisattva.	1
Others believe that it is for the sake of the error-free understanding of the nature of the perfection of wisdom, which is profound by nature, by way of the three natures.	1
For it is stated as follows in two verses from the Abhidharmasūtra 10: it is a reality in relation to the other-dependent nature.	1
(c) Since that which is characterized as the perfected both exists and does not exist as a reality, it is a reality in relation to the perfected nature.	1
Teachings about magical creations and the like are in relation to the world¹1; teachings about non-existence are in relation to the imaginary; however, teachings about the perfected pertain to the four kinds of purity these are: intrinsic purity, immaculate purity, the purity of the objective support and the purity of the path, for, the pure dharmas are incorporated in these four.	1
[The teachings from the Sutras about magical creations etc.	1
are in relation to the world¹2, i.e.	1
the other-dependent nature, because, like a magical creation etc., it is a false appearance.	1
The teachings about non-existence are in relation to what does not exist, i.e.	1

Thus the abridged meaning of these two verses is that all pure dharmas are included in these four purities.]	1
Others believe that the natures are admitted as threefold¹* in order to demonstrate that they are the respective objects of mundane, supramundane and the direct intuition attained	1
[3] Why is reality considered in relation to the three natures?	1
For 'reality' has the sense of being 'not erroneously inverted', thus what is intended by this question: "why reality considered in relation to the three natures?	1
", is: why is that which is not erroneously inverted considered in relation to the three natures?	1
III.3 ab The three natures [refer to]: (a) that which is eternally non-existent¹6 etc.	0
That which is characterized as the imaginary is eternally non-existent.	1
That [object] in regard to which naive people have notional attachment to the appre- hended object and apprehending subject and also to the signified and signifier, like in a dream, has¹7 an imaginary nature because its essential nature does not exist.	1
Hence¹8, since it has both the nature of a non-ens and is without error, that which is character- ized by the imaginary does not exist.	1
Consequently, only non-existence is described as the reality in relation to the imaginary nature because it is not erroneously inverted.	1

That which is characterized by the imaginary, i.e.	1
the apprehended object and apprehending subject etc., does exist since it is the basis of conventional [linguistic] usage.	1
However, because it does not exist in its nature as apprehended object and apprehending subject etc.	1
it does not exist as a reality as such.	1
In order to clearly illustrate this, he says: because it consists in 'bare' error.	1
This is what is being said: that which appears 20, like the material cause of a magical creation, does exist; the way in which it appears, like a magically created man etc., i.e.	1
in the aspect of apprehended object and apprehending subject, does not exist as such hence it is [described as] error.	1
It is a reality in relation to the other-dependent nature21.	1

That it is because it is not erroneously inverted	1
[5] That which is characterized as the perfected both exists and does not exist as a reality 22.	1
That which is characterized by the perfected is a reality that both exists and does not exist.	1
It exists because it has the nature of the existence of the non-existence of the duality; and it does not exist because it has the nature of the non- existence of the duality.	1
It is a reality because it is the objective support for purity.	1
It is a reality in relation to the perfected nature; it is the fact that this is because it is not erroneously inverted that is referred to.	1

Now if one is notionally attached to the non-existence of both the apprehending subject and apprehended object alike, then the negation in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject [occurs]28.	1

In this context, existence refers to the existence of the non-existence of the duality.	1

If one grasps it as a definite non-ens, then it is negated.	1
Moreover, non-existence refers to the non-existence of the duality.	1
If one grasps this in terms of annihilation, then non-exis- tence is imputed as an absolute non-existence.	1
Now if one grasps it just by way of the duality, then there is negation because it is manifested as a non-existent duality.	1
Alter- natively, if one grasps it as having an existent essential nature, then there is imputation.	1

Since the perfected characteristic has emptiness for its own-being its very intrinsic nature is emptiness.	1
III.7 cd Since the very characteristic of the imaginary nature does not exist the very absence of characteristic is its insubstantiality.	0
Since the char- acteristic of the other-dependent does exit, but not in the manner in which it is imagined, the characteristic which is a characteristic differ- ent from that [which is imagined] is its insubstantiality.	1
However, since the perfected nature consists in insubstantiality, the individual characteristic44 itself is its insubstantiality.	1
The three kinds of impermanence have now been revealed in relation to the threefold basic reality as the impermanence of: (a) a non-existing object, (b) the impermanence of what comes into being and passes away and (c) the impermanence of what is stained and stainless.	1
The nature of suffering is threefold: (a) suffering due to appropri- ating, (b) suffering due to the characteristic and (c) suffering due to association.	1
Emptiness is threefold: (a) the emptiness of what is non- existent, (b) the emptiness of what exists as something other and (c) the emptiness of own-being.	1
Insubstantiality is threefold: (a) insubstan- tiality as the absence of characteristic, (b) insubstantiality as a different characteristic and (c) insubstantiality as the individual characteristic.	1
[Sthiramati] Insubstantiality is explained as: (a) the absence of characteristic, (b) the difference of characteristic from that [which is imagined] and (c) the indi- vidual characteristic.	1

to the erroneous inversion of permanence, pleasure, purity and the substan- tiality.	1
Previously, the inclusion of the other realities within the basic reality was asserted, hence he asks: how do the latter relate to basic reality?	1
As the impermanence [of what is impermanent] etc48.	1
The impermanent etc.	1
refers to the modes of the impermanent, the painful, the empty and the insubstantial the state (-tā of anitya-tā) of that is impermanence etc.	1
In order to demonstrate that the reality free from erroneous inversion is included within the basic reality, he says: An impermanent object is: (a) a non- existent object etc.	1
For there are three kinds of impermanent object: (a) the object as existent, (b) the object as coming into being and passing away and (c) the object as stained and stainless; that which exists eternally as such is perman- ent; the inverse of this is impermanent; ...in relation to these [three], respec- tively.	0
With regard to these: (a) the imaginary nature is impermanent in the sense of the impermanence of something eternally non-existent; others believe that this is to be understood according to the rules of grammatical analysis, i.e.	1
the impermanent (anitya) is always non-existent (asannitya).	1
(b) The other-dependent nature is impermanent in the sense of impermanence characterized by coming into being and passing away every moment, because it arises from causal conditions, and because there is no causality when it passes away.	1
(c) The perfected nature is impermanent in the sense of adven- titious impermanence 49 which is characterized by both the possession of stain and stainlessness, although it consists in a dharma50 that does not change.	1
III.5 c Suffering is stated as being due to: (a) appropriating, (b) the charac- teristic etc.	0
Suffering51 is threefold: (a) the suffering due to appropriating, (b) the suffering due to the characteristic and (c) the suffering due to association.	1
Of these, the imaginary nature consists in suffering that is (a) due to appropriating.	1
There is suffering since suffering is appropriated (upādīyate) either in the present life or in other lives on account of the absence of clear comprehension.	1
And in order to demonstrate the manner in which suffering is appropriated on account of this absence of clear compre-	1

personal entity and the dharmas.	1
There is the notional attachment to the personal entity and the dharmas since one becomes notionally attached to the personal entity and the dharmas through 'grasping' an entity on account of this [absence of clear comprehension].	1
This [appropriating] belongs to the imaginary nature because it has 'fallen' into duality.	1
It is described in this way because the continuation of suffering is due to the notional attachment to the imaginary nature52.	1
The imaginary itself is not suffering because it does not exist53.	1
Alternatively, since the imaginary nature is appropriated in the nature of an entity on account of the notional attachment to the personal entity and the dharmas, thus the imaginary nature consists in the suffering that is due to grasping.	1
[4] The other-dependent nature is referred to as the suffering that is (b) due to the characteristic.	1
For the threefold nature of suffering refers to the suffering of suffering, the suffering of change and the suffering of the formative forces.	1
Moreover, since these three sufferings are the sufferings that pertain to the other-dependent54, they are [described as] the suffering that is due to the characteristic.	1
[5] The perfected nature consists in suffering that is: (c) due to association.	1
The word "and" has a conjunctive sense.	1
How is it due to association?	1
He says: due to the association with suffering.	1
The other-dependent nature consists in suffer- ing; the real nature of the latter is described as suffering because even though perfected it is also associated with suffering.	1
[Thus should suffering be understood] in relation to that [threefold] basic reality, respectively.	1
In this regard, the suffering that is on account of grasping consists in the imaginary.	1
[The suffering] that is on account of the characteristic consists in the other-dependent.	1
[The suffering] that is on account of association consists in the perfected.	1
Emptiness is threefold: (a) emptiness as non-existence, (b) emptiness as an existence as something other and (c) emptiness as intrinsic nature.	1
Therein, emptiness as non-exis- tence pertains to the imaginary nature.	1
In order to clearly illustrate just this55, he says: since the imaginary characteristic, like the essential nature of horns on a hare	0
Emptiness is considered as: (a) non- existence, (b) existence as something other and (c) intrinsic nature; Tib.	0
is slightly different: "...because notional attachment to the imaginary nature is the ground for the continuity of suffering", kun brtags pa'i no bo ñid la mnon par žen pa ni sdug bsnal gyi rgyun gyi rgyu yin pas (D246a.6).	0

The emptiness of what exists as something other pertains to the other-depen- dent [nature].	1
In order to clearly illustrate just this, he says: since the other-depen- dent characteristic does not exist in the manner in which it is imagined by naive people, i.e.	0
in the nature of the duality, but is not non-existent in every respect.	1
Moreover, the mode in which it does exist is understood through mundane direct intuition that is pure; therefore its existence as something other is empti- ness 57.	1
The emptiness as intrinsic nature pertains to the perfected [nature], hence he says: since the perfected characteristic has emptiness for its own-being; because it has the non-existence of the duality for its own-being; therefore, its very intrinsic nature is emptiness, i.e.	1
its very own-being.	1
III.7 c Insubstantiality is threefold: (a) insubstantiality as the absence of characteristic, (b) insubstantiality as a difference of characteristic59 and (c) insubstantiality as the individ- ual characteristic.	0
Of these, the absence of characteristic itself is an insubstantiality because there is the absence of the characteristic of a nature that is imaginary.	1
This is why he says: since the very characteristic of the imaginary nature does not exist, the very absence of characteristic is its insubstantiality 60, i.e.	1
he shows that it does not exist in any other mode.	0
Insubstantiality as a difference in char- acteristic pertains to the other-dependent, because, the characteristic of the other- dependent does exist, in the nature of an entity, but not in the way in which it is imagined by naive people, i.e.	1
as the duality; the other-dependent character- istic which is a characteristic different from that, i.e.	1
dissimilar to the imagined characteristic is its insubstantiality.	1
Thus, its insubstantiality is shown to be an imaginary substantiality61.	1
Insubstantiality as the individual characteristic62 is pertinent to the perfected since the perfected nature consists in insubstantial- ity because it has the non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending	1

insubstantiality, he shows that the perfected dharma has insubstantiality for its own-being63 [8] Just what difference is there between these two terms, i.e.	1
emptiness and insub- stantiality?	1
Some believe that wherein something does not exist, the former is empty of the latter; however, if something is not the substance (ātman), i.e.	1
the own-being of something else, on account of this, the latter is insubstantial (anãtman) - this is the difference between the two.	1
Others again believe that although there is no difference in reality, there is a difference according to the way in which they are respectively deter- mined, since that wherein something does not exist is insubstantial because of the absence of own-being on its part, however, in the former case, its emptiness is on account of the absence of the perfected nature within it.	1
[9] In order to demonstrate that they [act as] the counteragents to the extremes of imputation and negation and also that they consist in adventitious stain the three kinds of impermanence have now been respectively revealed64 in relation to the threefold basic reality as: (a) the impermanence of a non-existing object, (b) the impermanence of what comes into being and passes away and (c) the impermanence of what is stained and stainless.	1
The reality free from erroneous inversion65 is described in this way, concluding with the statement: insubstantiality is threefold.	1

Origination as latent impression refers to the latent impressions of the notional attachment to the imaginary nature.	1
Origination as mani- festation refers to karma and moral defilement.	1
Origination as non-sep- aration refers to the non-separation of thusness from obscuration.	1
The truth of cessation [is considered] through the three kinds of cessation.	1
The three kinds of cessation are: III.9 ab III.8 cd Considered as: (a) non-origination by way of own-being, (b) non-origi- nation by way of the duality and (c) the two extinctions of stain; Non-origination by way of own-being, non-origination by way of the apprehended object and apprehending subject and the two extinc- tions of stain are stated as cessation through critical consideration and also as thusness.	1
These are the three kinds of cessation, namely, cessation by way of own-being, cessation by way of the duality and cessation by way of intrinsic nature.	1
How is the truth of the path respectively determined in relation to the threefold basic reality?	1
III.9 cd & 10 a In relation to their: (a) clear compre- hension, (b) renunciation and (c) realization as attainment; this is stated as the truth of the path.	0
I.e.	0
in relation to: (a) the clear comprehension of the imaginary [nature], (b) the clear comprehension and renunciation of the other-dependent [nature] and (c) the clear comprehension of the perfected [nature] and its realization as attainment.	1
Thus it should be understood that the establishment of the truth of the path in this regard is in relation to clear comprehension, renunciation and realization.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] Since the reality of cause and result should be discussed immediately after the latter [i.e.	1
the reality free from erroneous inversion], he says: the reality consisting in cause and result ...in relation to that same basic reality 66.	0
Therein, concerning the side of defilement, the truth of suffering is [equivalent to] the reality of	1
cf.	0
Bhäşya N40.5.Y121	0
concerning the side of purification, the truth of cessation is [equivalent to] the reality of the result and the truth of the path is [equivalent to] the reality of the cause.	1
In this way the four truths, beginning with suffering, are [equivalent to] the reality of cause and result.	1
It has been said that [this reality] is [equivalent to the truth67 of suffering, its origination, its cessation and the path [to the latter] in rela- tion to that same basic reality68.	1
[2] And since it is not discerned how basic reality pertains to the own-being of the truth of suffering etc.	1
he asks: how does the threefold basic reality consist in the [four] truths beginning with suffering?	0
Hence he says: because the latter are characterized69 by impermanence etc.	1
III.8 b Hence 70 it is considered as the truth of suffering;	0
the characteristics of the truth of suffering and, as a totality, these exist individually in the imaginary etc.	1
Hence, the imaginary etc.	1
are intended, individually, as the truth of suffering.	1
[3] The truth of origination [is considered] as the threefold basic reality, respectively, through the threefold categories of origination.	1
Since their origination is not understood, he says: the threefold categories of origination	0
The three kinds of origination are: (a) origination as latent impression, (b) origination as manifestation and (c) origination as non-separation.	1
Of these, the origination as latent impression should be understood as the imaginary nature; hence he says: ...refers to the latent impressions of the notional attachment to the imaginary nature.	0
Since, although the imaginary nature does not exist, the dharmas that consist in the mundane respectively determine the latent impressions of both con- ceptual differentiation and moral defilement72 on account of notional attachment to its existence; however, the [dharmas that consist in the] supramundane and which are without notional attachment, do not.	1
Consequently, the imaginary nature is described as origination as latent impression.	1
Origination as manifestation should be (a) latent impression, (b) manifes- tation and (c) non-separation.	1

a substantial nature.	1
That which comes into being from something else is [described as] "origination as manifestation", because it originates from this.	1
Furthermore, as to its essential nature, he says: ...refers to karma and moral defilement and these two consist in the other-dependent nature because they have the nature of substantial entities.	0
Origination as non-separation refers to [the non-separation] of thusness74; how so?	1
Hence he says: [its] non-separation from obscuration.	1
This is what is being said: [thusness] receives the title "origination" since: (a) suffering originates as long as thusness is not separate from obscuration, or (b) thusness which is not separate from obscuration -	1
[4] The truth of cessation which consists in basic reality [is considered] through the three kinds of cessation and since these are not discerned, he says: the three kinds of cessation are: III.9 ab Considered as: (a) non-origination by way of own-being, (b) non-origi- nation by way of the duality and (c) the two extinctions of stain;	1
since it is an absolute non-origination because it is devoid of own-being, like the son of a barren woman.	1
Non-origination by way of the apprehended object and	1
utely devoid of the essential nature 75 of an apprehended object and apprehending subject, it is non-origination by way of a nature that consists in an erroneous duality.	1
And the two extinctions of stain refer to the perfected; the word "and" has the conjunctive sense.	1
But since these [extinctions] are not discerned, he says: ...are stated as cessation through critical consideration and also as thusness76.	0
Stain is twofold: (a) obscuration such as passion and (b) the imaginary.	1
Therein, when the 'seed' has been extracted from its basis through direct intuition that is without impu- rity, an extinction [is achieved] which consists in the absolute non-origination of the stain of passion etc.	1
this is cessation through critical consideration.	1
By means of direct intuition into the absence of the duality which belongs to the sphere of thusness, an extinction [is achieved] which consists in the non-origination of the stain of the imaginary; this is thusness.	1
Both of these consist in the perfected nature.	1
These three	1

imaginary, according to their respective enumeration.	1
However others believe that the extinction77 of these dual stains consisting in moral defilement and the imaginary are described as thusness on account of the penetration of thusness because of the state- ment: cessation by way of the duality and cessation by way of intrinsic nature.	1
Intrinsic nature refers to thusness because this refers to the intrinsic luminos- ity of mind.	1
Hence, since it has thusness for its objective support, this cessation is described as cessation by way of intrinsic nature, [whereas] cessation alone78 is [described as] cessation through critical consideration.	1
Others believe that cessation is [equivalent to] thusness inasmuch as [suffering] has ceased in the latter79.	0
Further- more, since cessation consists in non-origination, after collecting together all [elements] that have non-origination etc.	1
for their own-being, they are described as the truth of cessation.	1
The inclusion of the truth of cessation within basic reality has now been described.	1
[5] However, since the truth of the path should be included immediately after the latter, he asks: how is the truth of the path respectively determined in relation to the threefold basic reality ?80 Hence the statement beginning with: III.9 c In relation to their: (a) clear compre- hension [(b) renunciation]81 etc.	1
since the imaginary nature is absolutely non-existent there is only its clear comprehen- sion and not its renunciation, for the renunciation of what does not exist is not tenable.	1
(b) In relation to the clear comprehension and renunciation of the other- dependent [nature], for the other-dependent is to be understood as not existing in the manner in which it appears but not as non-existent in its whole nature, like the imaginary; also, because karma and moral defilement have the nature of entities82, it	1

Since the turning about of the basis is to be realized as the liberated Dharma Body, emptiness should be clearly comprehended.	1
Cessation should be realized through the realization as attainment.	1
Others believe that there are two aspects to both [clear comprehension and realization] because clear comprehension is twofold: (a) clear comprehension as knowledge and (b) clear comprehension as renunciation84.	1
Therein, the first and the third [natures] are to be clearly comprehended through clear compre- hension as knowledge but the second [nature] should be clearly comprehended as both.	1
Realization also is twofold: (a) realization as knowledge and (b) realization as attain- ment.	1
Therein, although all three [natures] are to be realized through realization as knowledge only the third is [to be realized] through realization as attainment.	1

Bhäşya N41.3.N42 The absolute truth is to be understood as being due to the one, i.e.	0

by way of: (a) object, (b) attainment and (c) spiritual prac- tice; (a) The absolute as object is thusness, considering that it is the object of the highest direct intuition.	1
(b) The absolute as attainment is nirvana, considering that it is the highest object.	1
(c) The absolute as spiritual practice is the path, considering that the highest is its object.	1
How can both the unconditioned and the conditioned be described as the perfected nature?	1
III.11 cd The two [are considered] by way of perfection that is unchanging and free from erroneous inversion.	0
The unconditioned is perfected insofar as it is [equivalent to] unchanging perfection.	1
The conditioned, which is incorporated in the truth86 of the path, [is perfected] insofar as it is [equivalent to] perfection free from erroneous inversions because of the absence of erroneous inversion in regard to the entity that is the object of knowledge.	1
[Sthiramati] Y123.9 [1] The reality of the gross and the subtle87; gross reality refers to conven- tional truth; subtle reality refers to absolute truth.	0
Since, at the beginning, [the bodhisattva] brings beings to maturity by means of the gross but liberates those who have reached maturity by means of the subtle, the gross is [explained] prior to the subtle which follows.	1
This statement is contradictory to the congruity of a verse [i.e.	1
III.1d].	0
Therein conventional truth refers to gross reality because it is the domain of non-concentrated knowledge; absolute truth refers to subtle reality because it is the domain of concentrated knowledge.	1
Alternatively, [the former] refers to the gross because it is the domain of consciousness and [the latter] refers to the subtle because it is the domain of direct intuition.	1
Since it has been asserted that all the realities are intended as being included within basic reality, he asks: how should this be understood in relation to basic reality?	1

"Knowledge" refers to the notional attach- ment to an object although it does not exist.	1
The conventional usage that results from that [knowledge] is the conventional as knowledge; furthermore, this refers to the conceptual differentiation that pertains to notional attachment.	1
Therefore, the conven- tional truth consists in the other-dependent as it consists in the conventional by way of knowledge.	1
"Utterance" is that which [provides] a clear indication of the dharmadhātu - which is inexpressible through words such as 'thusness'.	1

[6] Now the absolute truth should be mentioned, hence he says: III.10 d However, the absolute [should be understood] by way of the one.	1
For it is impossible that the absolute can belong to the imaginary and other-dependent [natures]; however, absolute truth is to be understood as being due to the	1

devoid of stain is the characteristic of the turning about of the basis.	1
How can this be the absolute?	1
Hence he says: considering that it is the highest objecti01, i.e.	0
considering that it is both an object (artha) and is the highest (parama), it is the highest object (paramārtha).	1
It is the highest in this regard because it is foremost among the unconditioned and conditioned dharmas; it is an object in the sense that it is the aim of the path.	1
For thus, the attainment of nirvana is the aim of the path but nirvāṇa is the object [i.e.	1
the aim] because it is free from all harmful faults since that which is accom- panied by fault is described as a non-object.	1
[9] (c) The absolute as spiritual practice is the path; why is this?	1
Consid- ering that the highest is its object; object (artha) here means [sense]-object (vişaya) or aim (prayojana)102; the object is thusness, the aim is nirvāṇa.	1
[Objection]: If it is described as the highest 103 on account of the object, would there not be a recip- rocal dependence [i.e.	1
the path is highest on account of the object and the object is highest on account of the path]?	1
[Response]: If there is reciprocal dependence 104, what fault is there?	0
[Objection]: there can be no positive determination.	1
[Response]: This will not be so because there is reciprocal dependence as in the case of a lion and a forest 105 [10] How can both the unconditioned, namely nirvana, and the condi- tioned, namely the path, be described as the perfected nature?106 For absol- ute truth has been explained as the perfected nature, however, it is not tenable that the path be perfected considering that it has no non-existent previous and subsequent portions.	1
Therefore, the path is not [equivalent to] absolute truth and if it is not per- fected it cannot be included within absolute truth.	1

An alternate [objection]: how can the unconditioned, namely nirvana, and the condi- tioned, namely the path, be described as the perfected nature?	1
For the perfected refers to thusness and since it is devoid of the characteristic of the duality that pertains to the	1
not tenable.	1
[Response]: this objection is not tenable108 since the non-existence of the duality therein refers to the perfected, however, it is only the non-existence of the dual- ity that is [referred to as] the perfected, thus what is other than this is not refuted.	0
And hence the two perfected [natures) other than this which comprise the absence of change and the absence of erroneous inversion are also referred to as perfected.	1
The uncondi- tioned refers to nirvāṇa and thusness.	1
The unconditioned is perfected insofar as it is [equivalent to] unchanging perfection because it cannot be otherwise.	1
The conditioned, which is incorporated in the truth of the path and not elsewhere, is perfected insofar as it is [equivalent to] perfection free from erroneous inversion.	1
As to why this is so, he says: because of the absence of erroneous inversion in regard to the entity that is the object of knowledge; i.e.	1
since erroneous inversion never occurs in regard to the object of knowledge.	1
Therefore, the path is also perfected and consequently, due to the differ- ences in intended meaning, [the assertion] that the perfected [nature] pertains to both the conditioned and the unconditioned is not contradictory.	1

That which is established through reasoning results from the three; Since reasoning¹18 is carried out in regard to the threefold natures, the reality that is well established through reasoning is respectively determined through the three natures.	1
In order to demonstrate this since it is not known, he says: that ...by those	1
refers to those who are learned in argumentation¹19⁹.	1
The dialecticians refers to the examiners; after thinking about the explanation of the former [i.e.	1
those who are learned in argumentation], the latter term [i.e.	1
dialecticians] is stated ¹20.	0
Alternatively, those who are wise are the seekers for what is wholesome.	1
Those who are learned in argumentation are those whose skill is complete in regard to the non-contradictory meaning of the four types of reasoning which consist in: (a) consideration, (b) cause and effect, (c) [proof of] logical possibility and (d) real nature¹21.	1
The dialecticians are those who have the capacity for conjecture and exclusion and are the authors of the treatises that are free from erroneous inversion for they are based upon the scriptural statements of the tathāgatas.	1
The examiners are learned in their own and other's treatises and are scrutineers of virtues and faults.	1
However, some people do not read "examiners", consequently, they query just who these "wise ones" are when it is said: on the part of those who are wise'.	1
Hence¹22, [Vasubandhu] says: "those who are learned in argumentation".	0
Moreover, the latter are of two types because they can be situated on the level of dialectic or on the level of meditative development; therefore, the dialecticians are specified.	1
Since certain of these people are investigators of what is generally established 123, he says: based upon the three means of valid knowl- edge.	0
What is meant is: since there is no contradiction with the three means of valid knowledge ¹24.	1
The three means of valid knowledge are: (a) direct perception, (b) inference and (c) scriptural tradition.	1

Alternatively, he says: "based upon the three means of valid knowledge" because the probandum that has been established can be proved for others by means of the reason and example established through direct perception, inference and scriptural tradition.	1
An entity is established 127 through reasoning which consists in the proof of logical possibility; logical possi- bility refers to the three types of [inferential] mark because they are the means of substantiating the probandum.	1
The term: "proof of logical possibility" (upapattisādhana) is a tatpurușa compound.	1
The three types of [inferential] mark are mentioned because the substantiation of that [proof] is on account of these.	1
Reasoning is the means, through the specific formulation of which, all that pertains to the three types of [inferential] mark is stated.	1
Alternatively, the logical possibility is that which is not possible otherwise.	1
The reasoning that consists in its proof refers to the [train of thought] that connects the component parts of a syllogism - thus is the resolution of the term: "reasoning that consists in the proof of logical possibility" (upapattisādhanayukti), Alternatively, it may be resolved as: 'the reasoning that consists in the proof is logically possible' [i.e.	1
as a karmadhārya compound].	0
The term: "logical possibility" is employed in order to distinguish this from the other reasonings of proofl28.	1
In this way, based upon the three means of valid knowledge, an entity consisting in either of the three natures which is established through the reasoning of the proof of logical possibility is described as well established through reasoning ¹29.	1

The Reality of the Sphere of Purity.	1
There is the reality of the twofold sphere of purity: (a) the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement and (b) the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the knowable.	1
This [reality] is: III.12 cd A twofold sphere of purity; it is pro-	0
It is due just to the perfected nature for the other natures do not belong to the sphere of the two pure direct intuitions.	1
[Sthiramati] Y129.10 [1] Since the domain of purity should be mentioned immediately following the latter [i.e.	0
the well established reality], he says: there is the twofold reality of the sphere of purity.	1
Now, in order to demonstrate this twofold mode, he says: (a) the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement and (b) the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the knowable.	1
The purifi- cation of obscuration that consists in moral defilement is [equivalent to] the relinquish- ment of obscuration that consists in moral defilement ¹30.	1
The term: kleśăvaraṇaviśuddhijñāna may be interpreted either as [a dative or locative tatpuruşa compound, i.e.	1
:] the direct intuition: (a) leading to the purification of obscuration con- sisting in moral defilement, or (b) in regard to the purification of obscuration consisting in moral defilement.	0
What is meant is [the direct intuition]: (a) that has the purification of obscuration consisting in moral defilement for its aim, or (b) that causes that	1
obscuration consisting in moral defilement" refer to [direct intuition which has the purification of that] for its object.131 The sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the knowable should also be described in this way.	1
[2] Of these, obscuration that consists in moral defilement refers to all moral defile- ments and secondary defilements that are to be relinquished by the paths ¹32 of vision and meditative development.	1
Hence the domain of the direct intuition in regard to vision, meditative development and what relates to these two which is the reality of the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas133 is described as the truth of suffering, its origination, 130 Ms.(40a) line 2 begins: -varaṇaprahāṇam although Y's reading (p.129.13) would indicate that these two words are fully reconstructed.	0

purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement.	1
The knowable refers to that which is to be known and this, collectively, comprises the five branches of learn- ing.	1
These are stated as the learning in regard to: (a) subjectivity, (b) grammatical anal- ysis, (c) logic, (d) medicine and (e) all arts and crafts.	1
The obscuration that consists in	1
regard to these.	1
The purification of that is [the knowledge] comprised in the spiritual	1
mundane direct intuition and [the knowledge] comprised in the eleven spiritual levels beginning with the 'Joyous'.	1
Moreover, [this purification] refers to the knowledge that is attained subsequently to that [knowledge in the eleven levels].	1
This is present within the mental continuum of the bodhisattvas and tathāgatas, and, since its objective support is thusness because this has the sense of being all-pervading etc., the reality of the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the	1
has already been explained by way of the description of both the reality of the cause and result and the reality of the subtle, is it not so that their enumeration again here is unnecessary?	1
[Response]: It is not unnecessary because the reality of the cause and result and of the subtle were formerly mentioned in order to define them as entities.	1
However, in this context, it concems the mode in which obscuration is purified, hence, this [reality] is explained.	1
[3] This twofold sphere of purity is proclaimed as being due to just the one, i.e.	1
it is due just to the perfected nature.	1
Here now he provides the reason for the	1
intuitions 135.	0
What is the reason?	1
Because unreal imagination [which is equivalent to the other-dependent nature] is stained on account of its possession of the two stains that comprise disquiet, and the imaginary [nature] does not exist.	1
However, since real nature is the domain of the twofold direct intuition, the reality of the domain of purity 136 is determined as being just due to the perfected [nature].	1
The reality of the sphere of purity has now been described.	1

The Inclusion Reality.	1
III.13 ab How should the inclusion reality be understood in relation to the threefold basic reality?	1
There is the inclusion of: (a) the causal-sign, (b) conceptual differen- tiation and (c) the name, within the	1
of the perfected nature.	1
From the point of view of the five categories, according to which is appropriate, there is the inclusion of the causal-sign and conceptual differentiation by way of the other-dependent [nature] and [the inclu- sion] of name by way of the imaginary [nature].	0
III.13 cd There is the inclusion of correct direct intuition and true reality by way of the one.	0
[1] However, since the inclusion reality is to be mentioned immediately following the latter [i.e.	1
the reality of the sphere of purity], he asks: how should the inclusion reality be understood in relation to the threefold137 basic reality?	0
In order to demonstrate that the inclusion reality is included within the threefold basic reality, he says: III.13 ab There is the inclusion of: (a) the causal-sign, (b) conceptual differen- tiation and (c) the name, within the	0
[natures].	0
Therein, the inclusion reality comprises five categories, hence he says: from the point of view of the five categories, according to which is appropri- ate... 138 Five categories should be understood as being included within basic reality, according to which is appropriate, but not according to sequential order.	1
Now, the five categories are: (a) the causal-sign, (b) the name, (c) conceptual differentiation, (d) thus-	1
In the Ms.(40b.2) this passage reads as follows: tatra samgrahatattvam pañcavastūnity ata aha yathayogam pañcavastiny ärabhyeti, however the Tib.	0
has simply: de la bsdu ba'i de kho na ci rigs su sbyar ro źes bya ba ni (D253a.3).Y132	0
sion reality because all that is knowable is included within these five categories.	1
In this respect, some believe that the causal-sign refers to the store-consciousness, defiled mind and the actual consciousnesses.	1
It is [described as the "causal-sign" because it exists as a reciprocal cause.	1
The "name" is an expression or indication of just that causal-sign although it is inexpressible, like [a gesture such as] the winking of the eye.	1
"Conceptual differentiation" refers to mind and the mental concomitants associated with all the three realms [of existence] which consist in conceptual differentiation, as both own-being and particular, of the causal-sign as has just been described.	1
"Thusness" refers to emptiness.	1
"Correct direct intuition" consists in the supra- mundane and has thusness for its objective support.	1
Now, as to their sequential order: the causal-sign comes first therein because it is the foundation for the designation as the defilement; then comes the name because it is designated as the defilement; then comes conceptual differentiation because as soon as it has a name, then conceptual differentiation [occurs] in regard to that entity designated as a defilement; then comes thusness and correct direct intuition because that defilement is checked on account of thusness and correct direct intuition.	1
Others believe that the meaning of these five categories [is evident] in this verse: Error is the cause of error, the cause of that is disquiet.	1
Therefore, the cause of the latter is error¹39.	1
But knowledge in this regard 140 is intrinsically tranquil.	1
Therein, the cause of error¹41, which is incorporated in the internal consciousnesses of sight etc., is external and internal error which are incorporated in form and the like and sight and the like.	1
Furthermore, the cause of this external and internal error¹42 is disquiet and this is a latent impression of the store-consciousness.	1
The cause of this latent impression143 is none other than the external and internal error.	1
As a conse- quence, verbal expression in regard to it manifests and it is due to verbal expression that the latent impression is lodged in the store-consciousness.	1
The term "intrinsically tranquil" refers to thusness because the dharmadhātu is intrinsically undefiled ¹44.	1

path which has thusness for its objective support.	1
[2] Of these, there is the inclusion of the causal-sign and conceptual differentiation by way of the other-dependent [nature]145, because they are produced through causes and conditions, and [the inclusion] of the name by way of the imaginary [nature].	1
The name is included by way of the imaginary [nature] because no object exists in keeping with its name; thus, by connection, there is inclusion of name by way of the imaginary [nature] but its inclusion is not by way of own-being.	1
And if it is said that the imaginary nature in not included in the five cate- gories beginning with the causal-sign because it is established as being devoid of own-	1

Inasmuch as it is the reality of continuance, similarly it is: III.14 b	1

[Sthiramati] Y133.8 [1] Now151, the variety [of the realities] that are found in relation to the reality of differentiation and the way they are incorporated within basic reality is not known, hence he asks: how should the reality of differentiation be understood in relation to basic reality?	0
Hence he replies: the reality of differentiation is sevenfold.	1
As to which these are, he says: (a) the reality of continuance, (b) the reality of characteristic etc.	1
The seven types of thusness described in the Sandhinirmocana Sutra, beginning with the thusness of continuance and concluding with the thusness of correct spiritual practice are [equivalent to] these described here as the sevenfold reality of differentiation, beginning with the reality of continuance and concluding with the reality of correct spiritual practice.	1

Others believe that the reality of representation refers to the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differen- tiation because this is the basis of representation 153.	0

(f) The reality of purification is [equivalent to] the purification of obscu- ration that consists in moral defilement154 and this refers to thusness and the truth of cessation.	1

the nature of cessation155, is [equivalent to] the truth of cessation.	0

Moreover, since these three realities are eternally just thus, they are described as thusness.	1

imaginary and the other-dependent [natures].	0
Continuance therein refers to the continuity of creatures who have no beginning, and since this [continuity] does not exist, it consists in the imaginary nature.	1
However, these [creatures] consist in the other-dependent nature because their continuity is constituted by causes.	1

Since suffering and its origination are constituted by causes and conditions and because they have the imaginary [nature] for their object, the realities of arrangement and wrong spiritual practice are incorporated in these two [of the threefold basic realities].	1

[The one consists in the reality of characteristic, the reality of representation, the reality of purification and the reality of correct spiritual practice.	1
These four realities consist in just the one basic reality, namely, the perfected nature.	1
Therein, the reality of charac- teristic and the reality of purification are perfected insofar as they consist in the perfec- tion ¹60 that cannot be otherwise.	1
The reality of representation and the reality of correct spiritual practice are perfected insofar as they consist in the perfection that is free from erroneous inversion.	1

The sameness of the dharmas [is shown] through the two realities of characteristic and representation.	1

The sameness of wisdom is demonstrated through the reality of correct spiritual practice.	1
Hence it is said: The sameness of sentient beings is pro- claimed through the three, but the sameness of the dharmas through the two.	1
Thus the sameness of enlightenment and wisdom is demonstrated singly.	1

There are ten kinds of skill that act as the counteragents to these ten kinds of adherence to the belief in a non-existent self which manifests in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
These [adherences] are: (a) The adher- ence to the belief in its oneness.	1
(b) The adherence to the belief in its causality.	1
(c) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an experi- encer.	1
(d) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an agent.	1
(e) The adherence to the belief in its independence.	1
(F) The adherence to the belief in its sovereignty.	1
(g) The adherence to the belief in its perma- nence.	1
(h) The adherence to the belief in its defilement or purification.	1
(i) The adherence to the belief in its nature as a yogi.	1
(j) The adher- ence to the belief in its release or non-release.	1
How can this tenfold reality of skills be included within basic real- ity?	1
Because the aggregates etc.	1

latter by way of: (a) the imaginary, (b) conceptual differentiation and (c) real nature.	0
Form is threefold: (a) Imaginary form, i.e.	1
the imaginary nature that belongs to form.	1
(b) Conceptually differentiated form, i.e.	1
the other- dependent nature that belongs to form since it is in relation to that [nature] that [an entity] is conceptually differentiated as form.	1
(c) Form as real nature, i.e.	1
the perfected nature that belongs to form.	1
The aggregates, such as sensation, and also the elements and sense-fields etc.	1
should be construed in the same way as form [has been construed above].	1
Thus, since the aggregates etc.	1
are included within the three natures the tenfold reality of skills should also be understood in rela- tion to basic reality.	1
Although it has been stated that the skill in the aggregates etc.	1
acts as the counteragent to the ten kinds false view in regard to the self, the meaning of the aggregates etc.	1
has not been stated.	1
This will now be discussed.	1
[Sthiramati] Y135.19 [1] The reality of the skills was listed immediately after the reality of differentiation 161, so in order to clearly illustrate this he says: the reality of the skills is said to act as the counteragent to false views 162.	0
Moreover, since it is not known as to how the tenfold false views concerning the self [manifest] in regard to the aggregates etc., he asks: which are the tenfold false views concerning the self [that manifest] in regard to these163 [aggregates etc.]?	1
Hence he says: III.15 abcd & 16 ab The false views concerning the self [which manifest] in regard to these [aggregates etc.]	0
are in relation to: (a) oneness, (b) causality, (c) an experiencer, (d) an agent, (e) inde- pendence, (f) sovereignty, (g) perma- nence, (h) a basis for defilement and purification, (i) a yogi and (j) release and non-release.	1
164 It is the fact that [these false views arise] in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
that is referred to.	1

adherences which are dependent upon the other, i.e.	1
the apprehended object, manifest, when they are devoid of an object?	1
[Response]: But they are not devoid of an object; they manifest in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
Therefore, it is said that there are ten kinds of skill in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
which act as the counter- agents to these167.	0
How does this adherence [manifest] in regard to just the aggre- gates etc.	1
although the self cannot be positively determined to exist?	1
Because, when it is closely examined through reasoning, the self that is separate from the aggregates etc.	1
cannot be discerned; indeed all the deeds and essential nature that belong to the self, which those who believe in the self maintain, manifest only in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
Hence it is evident that it is just the aggregates etc.	1
which form the substratum for the adherence to the belief in the self.	1
Since this adherence to the self, on the part of those who are notionally attached to the self168, manifests in these ten forms and not in	1
agent to all adherence to the belief in the self.	1
These [adherences] are 169: (a) The adherence to the belief in its oneness; this is due to the adherence to the belief in the self as a whole entity among the five aggregates that have been appropriated.	1
The skill in the aggregates acts as the counteragent to this.	1
(b) The adherence to the belief in its causality; the adherence to the belief in causality in regard to the self is because sight and the like promote [such an adherence].	1
The skill in regard to the elements (dhātu)170 acts as the counteragent to this.	1
The adverse [adherence] and its counteragent should be stated similarly in regard to the other [sense faculties].	1
Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its causality 171 [is also explained as] the notion that everything proceeds from the self; i.e.	0
the adherence to the belief in its causality refers to the volition that consists in the notion that the self is the cause of virtuous and non-virtuous action for which there is an agreeable or disagreeable result in this birth¹72.	1
(c) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an experi- encer; [the notion that] the self is the agent of experience because it consists in voli- tion, but the 'manifest' and 'unmanifest' [of the Samkhya] 173 is an object of experience because it does not consist in volition.	1

ence to the belief in its nature as an agent; the belief that the self is the agent174 of properly performed and wrongly performed actions.	1
Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its agency refers to the notion that the self possesses instru- mentality etc.175 (e) The adherence to the belief in its independence¹76; [the notion that] the self exerts influence of its own accord; i.e.	1
the notion that it is the self that holds sway.	1
Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its independence refers to the notion that it exerts an influence in the production of the result which is in confor- mityli 177 with the cause.	1
(f) The adherence to the belief in its sovereignty; the notion that the self is the ruler, the master, or the iśvara.	1
Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its sovereignty refers to the notion that the self rules over activity that con- forms with the result178.	1
(g) The adherence to the belief in its perma- nence 179; the notion that, although it is impure in terms of the five entities beginning with cause, the self is definitely permanent, otherwise there would be the imputation of action not performed and the loss of action that has been performed 180 [i.e.	1
if there is no ātman, an action performed by A would be imputed to B and the result of an action performed by A would not be obtained by A] and similarly there would be an absence of memory and recognition.	0
(h) The adherence to the belief in its defilement and purification; because [one would believe that] it is the basis of defilement and purification.	1
(i) The adherence to the belief in its nature as a yogi; yoga is the fixation of the mind upon the self or the suppression of the breath and the mind.	1

yoga].	0

his fn.3 p.138.Y139 [2] How is this tenfold [reality of]182 the skills included within basic reality?	0
183 Because kill refers to proficiency¹84 in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
How can this be included within the three natures?	1
This question is posed by one who thinks this to be impossible185.	1
Because the aggregates etc.	1
are included in the three natures.	1
The fact that [the aggregates] relate to the domain of the skills is shown by the word "skill", but they do not relate to skill alone; hence the reality of the skills should be understood as being included therein by way of connection, but not by way of own-being.	1
Just as the truth of the path, which consists in the reality of the cause and result, is said to be included within the three [natures].	1
Although this may be so, it is not known just how they are included, hence it is asked: how are they included?186 Hence he says: III.16 cd It is the fact that the aggregates etc.	1
are included within these three natures that is referred to.	1
In this context, the inclusion of the aggregates is to be elucidated firstly because they were listed prior to the elements etc.	1
and since they pertain to form, he says: form is threefold.	1
How so?	1
As: (a) imaginary form, (b) conceptually differ- entiated form and (c) form as real nature.	1
What is (a) imaginary forml 188 therein?	1
It is the imaginary nature belonging to form; i.e.	1
that which, with the exception of its perception by way of name, is imagined in this regard as the own-being of the sense-object.	1
Because this is absolutely non-existent it is described as imaginary.	1
(b) Conceptually differentiated form, i.e.	1
the other-dependent nature belonging to form; what is meant is: it is dependent upon causes and conditions.	1
But why is this described as conceptually differentiated form?	1
Hence he says: since it is in relation to that [nature] that [an entity] is conceptually differen- tiated as form.	1
Due to a failure in clear comprehension 189 on account of their lack of insight into reality, people are notionally attached to form because of the fact that they perceive consciousness in the appearance of form 190. just as form [i.e.	0

fore, it is said that form is conceptually differentiated in relation to the other-dependent [nature].	1
(c) Form as real nature, i.e.	1
the perfected nature that belongs to form.	1
This refers to emptiness whose nature is devoid of both imaginary form and conceptually differentiated form.	1
The aggregates, such as sensation, and also the elements and sense-fields etc.	1
191 should be construed in the same way as form [has been construed above], i.e.	1
in the same way that form is included in the three natures after having differentiated it as threefold.	1
[By "etc."	0
is meant]: the aggregates that consist in sensation, perception, the formative forces and consciousness, as well as the elements, the sense-fields, the limbs of dependent origi- nation, the worthy and unworthy objects, the sense faculties, the three times192, the four truths, the three vehicles and both the conditioned and the unconditioned.	1
More- over, [all] that pertains to sensation etc.	1
and the elements etc., individually, are to be included in the three natures after distinguishing them as threefold according to the differences in their essential natures as imaginary 193, conceptually differentiated and real nature.	1
[3] Therein, in the same way that [an entity] in the appearances of form is imagined as the apprehended object, [so too] that absolutely non-existent existence of apprehending subject and apprehended object, which is imagined in relation to the appearances of sensation etc., is [described as] imaginary sensation, up to and concluding with imagi- nary consciousness.	1
Conceptually differentiated sensation, up to and concluding with conceptually differentiated consciousness, refers to that [sensation] in regard to which the conceptual differentiation as apprehending subject and apprehended object is performed.	1
Sensation as real nature refers to the perfected nature pertinent to sensation; it is to be understood in the same way [for the other aspects] up to and con- cluding with consciousness as real nature.	1
In detail, it should be stated in the same way, according to the circumstances, in regard to the elements and sense-fields etc.	1
[4] An entity that is to be nominally designated as form or sensation, and so on up to	1
consisting in the imaginary, the other-dependent and the perfected 194 natures.	1
How so?	1
The imaginary consists therein because [an entity] is designated as of the essential nature of form etc.	1
The other-dependent [consists therein] since it is this which is the support for the designation because it depends upon other causal conditions.	1
That which is absolutely devoid of an entity of form etc.	1
is the perfected.	1

[Response]: It is not meaningless because the essential nature of form etc.	1
is superimposed on that [i.e.	1
the imaginary nature] since the object does not exist in exactly that way in which 196 the name is used in regard to it; however, naive people are notionally attached to its essential nature.	0
[Objection]: Why is it that one is attached to it but not ¹97 as an object [existing] in reality?	1
[Response]: Because there is the exclusion from the relation of 'signified' and 'signifier' on the part of the	1
their objects were not different by nature then the name's capacity to signify would be excluded, like the object, because it would not be distinct from the essential nature of the object.	1
And the object's capacity to be signified would disappear because it would not be distinct from the essential nature of the name, due to the absence of a specific cause [i.e.	1
which causes the existence of that which is to be signified].	1
Alternatively, since there would be one 'signifier 198 belonging to the name and a different 'signified' belonging to the object, there would be an endless series of statements.	1
Moreover, if there were numerous names for the one object and numerous objects for the one name199, there would be multiple essential natures; however, it is untenable that the one [entity] can have multiple natures 200.	0
Moreover, a 'signifier' of non-existence would not exist, like the object, because the object would be [of the nature of]201 a non-exis- tent; alternatively, if the name were to exist its object would also exist.	1
In regard to dissimilarity, there would be no ascertainment of [the existence of an object con- formable with a word, since in this regard a 'tree' is only a word, it is not an object.	1
However, the object is not a 'tree' nor is it a 'non-tree'.	1
Therefore, the object of the word 'tree' is not the sphere of the knowledge of the 'tree' because the object of that [word] does not have the nature of a tree.	1
In this way202 there is the exclusion of the word and the object from the relation of 'signified' and 'signifier'.	1
In regard to dispar- ity, there would be no determination of 'signified' and 'signifier because of the absence of a determining cause.	1
[6] There is a theory that the name may generate the object or cause it to become mani- fest.	1
In this regard, [the name] does not generate [the object] because the name is applied to the object only after it has arisen.	1
This would lead to the conclusion that,	1

because the name is applied again and again.	1
Nor does [the name] cause [the object] to become manifest because the name is applied after the object is apprehended and it is not tenable that it would cause the manifestation of what has not been apprehended 203, i.e.	1
another person who does not know an object will not apprehend it with the same name; also, it is not tenable that that same [name] can cause both the manifestation and the non-manifestation of the same object.	1

[7] Thus, since the aggregates etc.	1

Although it has been stated that the skill in the aggregates	1

The Meaning of the Aggregates.	1

eY142.4 Now at the beginning these, i.e.	0
the aggregates, should be under- stood in a threefold sense: (a) In the sense of 'multiple'; in detail it is said: "any form belonging to the past, present or future..." (b) In the sense of 'collected'; i.e.	1
[the same scriptural reference continues]: "...after collecting all that [form] together..." And (c) in the sense of	0
mined as separate.	1
For 'aggregate' (skandha) has the sense of 'heap' (răsi) and thus is it generally understood in the sense of a 'heap'.	1
[Sthiramati] At the beginning [they are consid- ered in the sense of: (a) multiple, (b) collected and (c) disparate;	1
Now at the beginning these, i.e.	1
the aggregates are described and they should be understood in a threefold sense: (a) In the sense of	1
present or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or exalted, distant or near..."214; thus [they should be understood] in the sense of 'multiple' because numer- ous substantial entities of the past etc.	0
215 are described by the word 'aggregate'.	1
The aggregates [should be understood]; (b) in the sense of 'collected' because of the scriptural statement: "...after collecting together...".	1
By "after collecting ...together" is meant: after making into one216.	1
(c) In the sense of 'disparate'; it is the aggregates that are referred to.	1
The word "and" has a collective sense, i.e.	1
this belongs with the previous two statements: i.e.	1
in the sense of 'multiple' and in the sense of 'collected'.	1
Here now he gives the reason: because the characteristic of form	1
from the characteristic of sensation etc.	1
The words "separate" and "disparate" are synonyms.	1
What is the reason that in this context the meaning of the aggregates is respectively determined in terms of these three aspects?	1

Thus, what is generally understood as 'multiple', 'collected' and 'disparate' is described as a 'heap'.	1
The aggregates of sensation etc.	1
are to be understood in the same way as the aggregates of form.	1
Therein, an act of skill in regard to the meaning of the aggregates is described as the counteragent to the adher- ence to the belief in a unique self, namely, such as that all this that has been and will be	1
etc., differentiated as belonging to the past etc.	1
and collected together as a unity, is designated as the aggregate of form etc.	1
Moreover, the aggregates are respectively determined as threefold as counteragents to three kinds of confusion; the three kinds of confusion are: (a) confusion in regard to singularity, (b) confusion in regard to the conventional and (c) confusion concerning the mixture of characteristics.	1
III.17 cd b.	0
The Meaning of the Elements.	1
The next is considered in the sense of the 'seed' of: (a) the apprehending subject, (b) the apprehended object and (c) the perception of the latter.	1
What is next?	1
The elements.	1
In the above, (a) the sense of the 'seed' of the apprehending subject refers to the elements of sight etc.	1
; (b) the sense of the 'seed' of the apprehended object refers to the elements of form etc.	1
; and (c) the sense of the 'seed' of the perception of the latter refers to the elements of sight-consciousness etc.	1

of the 'seed' of: (a) the apprehending subject, (b) the apprehended object and (c) the perception of the latter.	1
The word "next" in this context219 refers to the elements since they were listed immedi- ately after the aggregates; this is why the author of the commentary also says: what is next?	1
The elements.	1
'Element' (dhātu) has the sense of 'seed' (bija); accordingly, 218 Ms.(44a.5): raśyartho; disregard Y's fn.5 p.142.	0

stood.	0
Moreover, this is distinguished as threefold because of the difference in result: (a) the element that consists in the apprehending subject, (b) the element that consists in the apprehended object and (c) the element that consists in the perception of the latter.	1
In the above, (a) the sense of the 'seed' of the apprehending subject	1
elements which begin with sight and conclude with mind.	1
They are [described as] apprehending subjects because they form the basis for the perception of sense-objects of form etc.	1
They are described as elements because they are the cause of [the elements of sight etc.	1
of the same genus.	1
(b) The sense of the 'seed' of the appre- hended object refers to the elements of form etc., concluding with the non- sensuous element.	1
Because they are the objects of sight-consciousness etc.	1
222 they are [described as] apprehended objects.	0
These too are described as elements because they are thus causes [in the production] of the form etc.	1
of a similar nature.	1
(c) The sense of the 'seed' of the perception of the latter refers to the elements of sight-consciousness etc.	1
; the perceptions regard to form etc.	1
are those which begin with sight-consciousness and conclude with mind-consciousness because they have the knowledge of form etc.	1
for their own-being.	1
These too are described as ele- ments because they are causes [in the production] of the sight-consciousness etc.	1
of a similar nature, i.e.	1
beginning with the element of sight-consciousness and concluding with the element of mind-consciousness.	1
[2] However, others say223 that the store-consciousness, imbued with the latent impressions of 224 the karma of notional attachment to sight etc., is the 'seed' of those respective [elements] of sight etc.	1
Similarly, the store-consciousness, imbued with225 [the latent impressions of 226 the karma inherent to the notional attachment to form etc., is the 'seed' of those respective [elements] of form etc.	1
Likewise, just the store- consciousness, imbued with the latent impressions of the karma inherent to the notional attachment to sight-consciousness etc., is the 'seed' of those respective [elements] of sight-consciousness etc.	1
[Objection]: If this is so, the following should be reflected upon: it would be just the store-consciousness that is signified by the word "element" and not (the faculty of sight etc.	1
[Response]: The elements have been respectively determined in this threefold sense as 'seed' in order to remove confusion concerning: (a) the agent, (b) the deed and (c) the karma.	1

The six external [sense-fields are considered] in the sense of the medium of origination for the experience of the dis- crimination of an object.	1

medium of origination for the experi- ence of: (a) sensation and (b) the discrimination of the object;227	1
poses the question: what is next?	1
This word "next", as a matter of course, stands just for the sense-fields because they were listed immediately following the elements, thus in order to show this, he says: it refers to the sense-fields.	1
Of these, the six internal sense-fields [are considered] in the sense of the medium of origination for the experience of sensation228.	0
The six external sense- fields [are considered] in the sense of the medium of origination for the experience of the discrimination of the object.	1
The medium of origination (āyadvāra) is equivalent in meaning to sense-field (ayatana).	1

(tanvanti) that [which originates] among the experience of sensation and the discrimi- nation of an object.	0
This differentiation as internal and external is according to the difference in the medium of origination for an experience either as sensation or conceptualization.	1
Sensations are either pleasurable, painful or neither pleasurable nor painful.	1
Because the latter are partaken of (upabhujyate), they are [described as] enjoyment (upabhoga); what is meant is: they are experienced (anubhūyate).	1
Only the internal sense-fields 229 are described as the medium of origination 230 for that experi- ence of sensation because, although the sense-objects are the medium of the origination of that [sensation], the support231 i.e.	1
sight etc., is the basis on account of the fact that: (a) it is helpful or obstructive, (b) it consists in clear comprehension in regard to that [sensation] and (c) it is specific, since the experience of sensation [occurs] by means of it when there is sight etc.	1
and [the experience of sensation] does not [occur] when there is no [sight etc.	1
1232.	0
The discrimination of an object refers to conceptualization (samjñā) because it has the nature of the apprehension of the sign of the object.	1
This consists in the experience of sense-objects 233 because it has the nature of the know- ledge of objects.	1
The external sense-fields are described as the medium of origination for those [conceptualizations]; but not the internal [sense-fields], for, even if they were the medium of origination for those [conceptualizations], in the absence of a sense	1
sense-fields of sight etc.	1
do exist.	1
The sense-fields should be known because they are the medium of origination for both sensations and the discrimination of objects together with their associated elements.	1
[2] The two apprehendings are very important.	1
Furthermore, apprehending is very important because it consists in the experience of the result of karma and also because it consists in the discrimination of objects.	1
Since there is the conceptual differentiation of an agent of experience on account of the experience of sensation and the discrimina- tion of objects, the sense-fields are respectively determined 235 in a twofold sense.	1
Thus, skill in the sense-fields [leads to the understanding that] the agent of experience consists in the internal sense-fields and the object of experience consists in the external sense-fields.	1
And since no other236 agent of experience exists, the adherence to the belief in the self as the agent of experience is checked.	1

D260a.1Y146 [3] [Objection]: The assertion that was made above is not tenable, i.e.	0
that because the sense-fields of sight etc.	1
are helpful or obstructive it is just the support of that [sensation] which is conventionally expressed as the agent of experience because, on account of the denial of [the existence of] form, the sense-fields of sight etc.	1
would also not exist, like the self.	1
[Response]: This censure is not appropriate because it is only imaginary form that is denied here, not conceptually differentiated form.	1

transformation on account of its projection by the karma that is imbued with the conceptual elaborations of sight etc.	1
The external sense-field is the appearance as form etc.	1
and belongs to the actual consciousness which has the latter [i.e.	1
the store- consciousness] as its cause.	1
The appearance as a common object and the237 appearance as sentient beings belong to the store-consciousness and are described as the external sense-field because they are the predominant-causal conditions in the arising of the actual consciousness which appears as the apprehended object and apprehending	1
[4] [Objection]: Is it not so that this (interpretation] conflicts with the words of the Sūtras which state that sight-consciousness and the like are produced in dependence upon the two [i.e.	1
sense faculty and external object]?	0
The appearance as form etc.238 is different from consciousness and it is not tenable that it alone can be the causal condi- tion for the arising of just itself because of the existence of the arisen and the non- existence of the non-arisen states239, and because action in regard to itself is contra- dictory.	1
Therefore, form and the like should necessarily be acknowledged as being different from their appearances in consciousness.	1
[Response]: This censure is not appropriate because consciousness in the appearance of form etc.	1
deposits the (causal) latent impression 240 in the causal consciousness for the arising of a consciousness of a similar nature; and due to a transformation in the latent impression, consciousness in the appearance of form etc.	1
is born again.	1
In this way, consciousness, when it has deposited a latent impression in the nature of an appearance of form etc.241, is described as the causal condition for consciousness, hence there is no contradiction with the Sutras.	1
Thus, the meaning of 'support', too, is appropriate for the appearance	1
own appearance.	1
Alternatively, that which is innate to consciousness is established as	1

external object by way of connection with the fact that the existence or non-existence of consciousness is due to the existence or non-existence of that [causal condition for the objective support] although there is no relation of producer and produced.	1
Similarly, here too, although the appearance of form etc.	1
and consciousness do not have243 the relation of that which is produced and producer, they are respectively determined as the causal condition and the possessor of the causal condition because there is no falla- cious reasoning regarding the existence or non-existence of consciousness as being due to the existence or non-existence of that [causal condition for the objective support].	1
[5] [Objection]: There would be no actual correspondence with an example for both the appearance of form etc.	1
and consciousness because they cannot be differentiated.	1
[Response]: This is not so because they are figurative differences244; for example, the consciousness of dreams, magical creations and cities of Gandharvas and the like, although ultimately undifferentiated, is respectively determined in the relation of that which is supported and the supporter just as it is (conventionally)245 differentiated in the aspects of apprehended object and apprehending subject because it is the basis for the conceptual differentiation of apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
Like- wise, there is no contradiction in the other cases too.	1
Moreover, the relation of that which is supported and the supporter is, in all cases, only expressed figuratively; it	1
not take a sense-object as objective support due to the fact that this [object] passes away immediately upon origination since [in the former case] it does not continue to exist at the time of the act of supporting and because [in the latter case] it does not exist.	0
Also, the sense-object is not tenable as the objective support whether it has or has not arisen or has both [arisen and not arisen], because: (a) it does not continue to exist when it has arisen and (b) that which has not arisen does not exist, since the act of supporting devoid of a foundation is not tenable.	1
An objective support for the presently existing consciousness is meaningless since it is through the mere fact of its existence that the relation of cause and result is determined 246 as the relation of that which is supported and the supporter because it is established as having the nature of that [which is supported].	1
Also, [the objective support] for that [consciousness] which is in the process of arising is meaningless because it does not [yet] exist.	1
[Objection]: [an objective support for that consciousness] in the process of arising is not meaning- 243 Read: rūpădinirbhasasya vijñānasya casaty as per Ms.(45b.6) in place of rūpädinirbhāsasya vijñānasya asaty, although the Tib.	0

an appearance as the latter.	1
[Response]: If the appearance as the object were caused by an object that is external to consciousness, then the consciousness of things belonging to the past, the future or to dreams would be devoid of aspect (niräkära), or else would not exist because of the non-existence of the object of those [things belonging to the past etc.].	0
An effect cannot be produced by causal conditions that are deficient247 since this would transcend the bounds of logic248 and the assertion that something non-exis- tent can possess a causal condition is also not tenable.	1
Moreover, the external object is not the causal condition of the objective support for consciousness since the latter exists even without the former.	1
Therefore, all consciousness of people who have	1
that consists in the external object.	1
d. The Meaning of Dependent Origination.	1

respect, (a) there is the imputation of causality due to imagining that the formative forces etc.	1
have dissimilar causes.	1
(b) There is the negation of causality due to imagining that [the latter] are devoid of causality.	1
(c) There is the imputation of result due to imagining that the formative forces etc., together with the self, manifest from causal conditions such as ignorance.	1
(d) There is the negation of result due to imagining that the formative forces etc., which have ignorance etc.	1
for their causal conditions, do not exist.	1
(e) There is the imputation of efficacy due to imagining that ignorance etc.	1
is instrumental in the production of the formative forces etc.	1
(f) There is the negation of efficacy due to imag- ining that [the latter] are devoid of power.	1
The absence of both impu- tation and negation should be understood as being due to the non-exis- tence of these [conditions).	1

[Sthiramati] Y148.6 [1] Since the meaning of dependent origination should be mentioned immediately after the meaning of the sense-fields, he says: the meaning of dependent origination: III.18 cd [It is considered in the sense of the imputation and	0
as has been stated in a Sutra: "when this exists, there is that.	1
Due to the arising of this,	1
tion."	0
In order to illustrate that in this context dependent origination is considered by way of the refutation of the imputation and negation of cause, result and efficacy, he says: dependent origination [is considered] in the sense of the absence of	0
"Efficacy" is stated by the word: "activity".	1
[2] In this respect, there is the imputation of causality...; this is due to imagining that the purușa, the iśvara, the atom 251 or the pradhana etc.	1
possess causality, having rejected ignorance etc.	1
[as the cause].	1
In order to demonstrate this, he says: ...due to imagining that the formative forces etc., concluding with old-age and death, have dissimilar causes.	0
"Dissimilar" refers to the notion that some- thing permanent such as the puruşa can be the cause of the formative forces etc.	1
which are impermanent; what is meant is: 'different' [i.e.	1
that a cause can produce something that is of a completely different nature to itself].	1
Alternatively, a cause is considered to require a modification of its essential nature, like the seed in relation to the sprout etc., but there can be no modification of essential nature on the part of that which is per- manent.	1
The imputation of causality is due to imagining causality in regard to a [result that is dissimilar [to its] cause.	1
[3] There is the negation of causality due to imagining that [the latter] are devoid of causality 252, ...; if one agrees that the formative forces etc.	1
are produced without a cause, ignorance etc.	1
is excluded as the cause of the formative forces etc.- 249 Ms.(46a.5): -ânaropānavādataḥ, but Y's emendation to -änaropānapavādataḥ is correct; cf.	0

253 Ms.(46b.2): samskärādihetutvam apodham; disregard Y's fn.1 p.149.Y150 [4] There is the imputation of result254 due to imagining that the forma- tive forces etc., together with the self, manifest from causal conditions such as ignorance.	0
Some believe that the formative forces etc.	1
manifest from causal conditions such as ignorance if the self exists, but do not [manifest] if it does not exist.	0
Thus, there is the im tion of result if the self is imputed upon the result such as the formative forces 255.	1
Others believe that the imputation of result is due to imagining that the formative forces etc., together with the self, manifest from causal conditions such as ignorance, either by being intimately connected with a substantial256 self or by being an agent that is beneficial or obstructive257 to the latter.	1
[5] There is the negation of result due to imagining that the formative forces etc., which have ignorance for their causal condition, do not exist258; for example 259, there are heretics who negate good conduct, bad conduct and other worlds [i.e.	1
subsequent rebirths] believing that there is no good conduct, there is no bad conduct and there are no other worlds.260 [6] There is the imputation of efficacy due to imagining that ignorance etc.	1
is instrumental in the production of the formative forces etc.	1
If it is imagined that in the production of the formative forces etc.	1
ignorance etc.	1
can cause the nature of an entity to become something other261, then there is imputation of efficacy.	1
[7] There is the negation of efficacy due to imagining that [the latter] are devoid of power.	1
There is the negation of efficacy due to imagining that the formative forces are devoid of power although they have the capacity for origination through the mere [imputation of the] existence of ignorance etc.	1
[8] The absence of both imputation and negation should be understood as being due to the non-existence of these [conditions].	1
The absence of imputation and negation should be understood as being due to the absence of that imputation and negation in regard to cause, result and efficacy 262.	1
Thus, whether [this belief relates] to a self separately 263 from ignorance etc.	0
or to something else, this skill in dependent origination should be understood as the counteragent to the adherence to the belief in an agent.	1
For, there is no self nor anything else in this regard, apart from	1

III.19 abcd e. The Meaning of the Possible and the Impossible.	0
of an other-dependence in relation to: (a) what is not desired, (b) what is desired, (c) purity, (d) concurrent births, (e) sovereignty, (f) complete attainment and (g) behaviour.	1
The possible and the impossible should be understood in the sense of a sevenfold dependence upon something other.	1
Of these, (a) there is dependence upon something other in relation to what is not desired due to falling into wretched states of existence, although not desiring it, on account of bad conduct.	1
(b) There is dependence upon something other in relation to what is desired due to the attainment of propitious states of existence on account of good conduct.	1
(c) There is dependence upon something other in relation to purity because of not bringing suffering to an end by not relinquishing the five hindrances and so on up until	1
since they cannot be born into the one world sphere.	1
(e) There is dependence upon something other in relation to sovereignty since women cannot become cakravartins etc.	1
(f) There is dependence upon something other in relation to complete attainment since a woman can- not become perfectly enlightened, whether it be individual enlight- enment or supreme enlightenment.	1

In the above "possible" is [equivalent to] 'cause'.	1
"Iimpossible" is [equivalent to] 'absence of cause'.	1
As has been stated in this verse [from Dhammapada, 223]: One ought speak the truth and not be angry; one ought give to a beggar even from a	1
here in this world one ought proceed to the presence of the gods.	1
It is understood that [proprieties (sthāna)] are [equivalent to] causes.	1
Alternatively, propriety (sthana) is (equivalent to] possibility (sambhava) and impropriety (asthāna) is [equivalent to] impossibility (asambhava).	1
The skill in these is [equivalent to] skill in the possible and the impossible.	1
"Dependence upon something other" (päratantrya) is the state (bhäva) of being dependent upon something other (paratantrasya); what is meant is: resting upon something other (parāyattatā).	0
Although this is sevenfold it is included within the three other-dependencies of karma, defilement and rebirth.	1
[2] Of these, there is dependence upon something other in relation to what is not desired...; what is not desired refers to the wretched states of exis- tence.	1
In order to demonstrate that the attainment of these [states of existence] rests upon bad conduct268 and is a dependence upon something other, he says: ...due to falling into wretched states of existence, although not desiring it269, on account of bad conduct, including actions of body speech and mind, such as the taking of a life, together with their preparation and consequences.	0

suffering271 in these [states], there is no desire on the part of anyone to attain rebirth there.	1
Since actions are powerful and are the cause of wretched states of existence, on account of the power of actions alone, one whose conduct is bad attains rebirth in such places although not desiring it.	1
[3] There is dependence upon something other in relation to what is desired due to the attainment of propitious states of existence on account of good conduct; what is desired refers to the attainment of the propitious states of existence.	1
The propitious states of existence are those of the gods and mankind.	1
Good conduct consists in: (a) abstention from the taking of life etc.	1
together with the preparation and consequences of the latter, (b) acts of generosity, respect and honour etc.	1
towards teachers, preceptors and those who possess virtue etc.	1
and (c) the special virtues of love and compassion and the like.	1
There is dependence on something other since rebirth in the propitious states of existence is dependent upon good conduct alone, for even those who seek it do not attain a propitious state of existence in any other way apart from [the practice of] good conduct.	1
[4] There is dependence upon something other in relation to purity...; purity refers to the relinquishment of moral defilement272.	1
...[by not relinquish- ing] the five hindrances, i.e.	1
: (a) the desire for sensual pleasure, (b) malice, (c) torpor and drowsiness, (d) excitability and remorse and (e) doubt; they are five after combining torpor and drowsiness as one, and similarly, excitability and remorse.	1
Non- specifically, they are hindrances (nivaraṇāni) since they hinder (nivṛṇvanu) the whole- some side.	1
Specifically, they are hindrances since they respectively conceal: (a) the joy of setting forth273 [from the household life], (b) correct spiritual practice for one who is inspired in the right way by fellow brahmacarins towards the actions of body and speech that conform to that [correct spiritual practice], (c) the absence of fainthearted- ness at the time of meditative calm, (d) the absence of distraction at the time of exertion and (e) the state of spontaneity at the time of meditative calm and penetrating insight.	1

suffering to an end.	1
The end of suffering refers to that [state] where suffering is non-existent and this is nirväņa277.	0
That this is not brought about is [equivalent to] its non-attainment; what is meant is: one does not attain nirvāṇa.	1
Alternatively, the end of suffering refers to the fact that one does not create the suffering pertinent to rebirth, for one does not create such278 suffering as that from which other suffering is entailed.	1
The dependence upon something other in regard to purity refers to the fact that it is subject to the relinquishment of the five hindrances.279 [5] There is dependence upon something other in relation to concurrent births of two tathāgatas or cakravartins280, existing simultaneously.	1
What is meant is: both together; ...i.e.	1
of two tathāgatas or two cakravartins, since they cannot be born into the one world sphere.	1
Some schools believe that with regard to the two tathāgatas, the world-sphere of 3,000 million worlds is meant; however, [the world-sphere that consists in the four continents [is meant] in regard to the two cakravartins.	1
Others believe that the world consisting in the four continents [is meant] in regard to the two tathāgatas as well.281 For the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, display their perfect enlightenment and parinirvāṇa in the world-sphere of 3,000 million worlds through the influence of the Dharma Body, in each world consisting in four continents, by means of the Transformation Body282.	1
For thus, the aim of the bodhisattvas, i.e.	1
the possession of death and rebirth283 in one of the worlds that con- sist in the four great284 continents in the Tuşita realms or among mankind 285, is the same in regard to the other worlds that consist in the four continents.	1
Therefore, they believe that the Venerable One, who was perfectly enlightened already in the Akaniştha realm, displays by means of the Transformation Body: (a) his birth and passing away in all of the worlds consisting in the four continents which are included in the [world- sphere of 286 3,000 million worlds and in the Tuşita realms and (b) everything such as the possession of rebirth among mankind.	1
In this respect the dependency on some- thing other in regard to concurrent existences refers to the fact that the birth of a Buddha and a cakravartin depends on unequal productive karma287.	0

[6] There is dependence upon something other in relation to sovereignty since women288 cannot become cakravarting etc.	1
Because it is only in the body of a man that the karma conducive to [rebirth as] a cakravartin has the power to provide the [appropriate] karma result, for a woman289 does not have the capacity to enjoy the [seven] 'jewels' such as a wife.290 The word "etc."	1
refers to sakra [i.e.	1
Indra] [7] There is dependence upon something other in relation to complete attainment since 2 woman291 cannot become perfectly enlightened, whether it be individual enlightenment or supreme enlightenment.	1
"Attainment" refers to the realization of: (a) Buddhahood or (b) pratyekabuddha-hood.	1
The dependence on something other in this context refers to its attainment by a man and its non-attainment by a woman292, because, like a rhinoceros [i.e.	1
a pratyeka- buddha], [a woman] is not suited to: (a) become a teacher in the three realms and (b) have no contact [with people], respectively.	1
Furthermore, [women] are vulnerable to all kinds of rogues and are unfit for perfect enlightenment without a teacher due to their scant wisdom.	1
[8] There is dependence upon something other in relation to behaviour because one endowed with [sound] views does not commit [violent] behaviour such as murder293, in contrast to the behaviour of ordinary people.	1
One endowed with [sound] views is [equivalent to] one who has insight into the truth.	1
"Murder" 294 refers to the taking of a life.	1
By the word "etc.	1
", the taking of what is not given and the like are referred to.	1
Those [acts] such as murder which have the acts of body and speech for their own-being do not manifest on the part of one	1

due to the fact that the path which [acts] as the counteragent to them has not arisen.	0
[9] Thus, the skill in the possible and the impossible is associated with a dependence upon something other in relation to what is not desired etc.	1
and is the counteragent to the adherence to the belief in the independence of the purușa and the iśvara etc.	1
For, if there were no dependency whatsover, [people] should not fall into wretched states of existence on account of bad conduct.	1
It should be stated similarly in regard to the other cases as well.	1
There are twenty-two kinds of faculties: III.20 ab	0
the purpose of: (a) perception, (b) du- ration, (c) continuity, (d) experience and (e) the two purities.	1
[They are considered] as being for the purpose of [the five begin- ning with perception and concluding with the two purities, since they exercise a dominant influence in regard to these [five].	1
For, (a) there is the dominant influence of the six beginning with sight in relation to the perception of sense-objects of form etc.	1
(b) [There is the dominant influence of the vital faculty in relation to duration since death does not occur on account of its dominant influence.	1
(c) [There is the domi- nant influence] of the female and male faculties in relation to the continuation of the family because these [faculties] exercise a dominant influence in the procreation of offspring.	1
(d) [There is the dominant influence] of the faculties of sensation in relation to experience since one experiences the result of wholesome and unwholesome action.	1
And (e) [there is the dominant influence] of faith etc.	1
in relation to mundane purity; [there is the dominant influence] of the faculty of understanding what has not been understood etc.	1
in relation to supramundane purity.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] Since the meaning of the faculties should be mentioned immediately following the explanation of the meaning of the possible and the impossible, he says: there are twenty-two kinds of faculties, i.e.	1
beginning with the faculty of sight and204 concluding with the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge.	1
Moreover, in this context "faculty" (indriya) has the sense of 'dominant influence' (adhipatya).	1
As to which has dominant influence where, he says: III.20 ab	0
the purpose of: (a) perception, (b) du- ration, (c) continuity, (d) experience and (e) the two purities.	1
297 In this [verse] the word "dominant influence" is to be understood as having been omitted for metrical reasons; properly298 [it should read]: "as being for the purpose of exercising a dominant influence upon: ...(e) the two [purities]".	1
Therefore, the author of the commentary says: since they exercise a dominant influence in regard to these [five].	0
The expression: "for the purpose of" (artha) in the statement: "for the purpose of perception", signifies 'aim' (prayojana).	1
He shows that the faculty therein is for the purpose of perception 299.	0
The same should be stated, respectively, in other cases as well.	1
"in regard to these" [means] in regard to the perception of the	0
dominant influence is [equivalent to; causality.	0
[2] The sense-objects of form etc.	1
are those beginning with form and concluding with the non-sensible.	1
The perception of the latter consists in sight-consciousness	1
with sight.	1
It is described as a faculty since it is a superior power over colour etc.300 because sight is the basis for the consciousness which differentiates form/colour (rūpa) without exception.	1
However, the colour blue cannot be the objective support for the consciousness of the colour yellow etc.- 301 In detail, the same should be stated, respec- tively, with regard to hearing etc.	1
[3] [There is the dominant influence] of the vital faculty in relation to duration.	1
The vital faculty, which is pierced by the latent impressions of previous	1
consists in the capacity for rebirth in each subsequent moment which corresponds to each preceding moment.	1

not occur on account of its dominant influence.	1
The absence of death is [equivalent to the continuance of the homogeneous groups projected by previous karma.	1
Food and the like are not faculties even though they are instrumental in the maintenance of life because, in spite of their presence, there is no continued existence when life is extinguished and also, because in the realm of form and the formless realm, the presence of continued existence is due only to the vital faculty, even though there is no bodily nutriment.	1
Moreover, in this case the dominant influence of contact etc.	1
in relation to continued existence is not tenable because the maintenance of sentient beings in the conditions of the attainment of cessation and non-consciousness and also in [induced] non-consciousness is possible, even though contact etc.	0
is absent.	1
[4] [There is the dominant influence] of the female and male faculties in relation to the continuation of the family304.	1
Since there is no break in the continuation of the family when a son is born the continuation of the family refers to the birth of a son.	1
Now, in order to demonstrate this, he says: because of their	1
receives the title: "female" or "male faculty" because it exerts a particular dominant influence.	1
Where there is the establishment of the family, there is the presence of the female faculty and the male faculty and by virtue of these there is no break in the conti- nuity of the family.	1
Moreover, the family is established among the gods dwelling in	1

For, there is no dominant influence in this respect on the part of gandharvas etc.	1
because there is no capacity for the procreation of sons on the part of eunuchs etc.	1
who have no female or male faculties305, even if the gandharvas etc.	1
are present306.	1
Furthermore, food and the like are not faculties because they are not enu- merated among animate things although they are dominant influences [of sorts].	1
[5] [There is the dominant influence] of the faculties of sensation in relation to experience; the fact that this is a dominant influence is understood.	1
How so?	1
Hence he says: because one experiences the result of wholesome and unwholesome action.	1
The faculties of sensation are five: pleasure, pain, gladness, sadness and equanimity.	1
It is [through the dominant influence] of these that one experiences the result of wholesome and unwholesome karma because they have the nature of experience, but name / form (nămarūpa) have no dominant influence over them because they are [only] the ground for sensation.	1

[6] Mundane purity refers to the relinquishment of the mundane moral defilement.	1
In regard to this (there is the dominant influence] of faith etc., i.e.	1
of the five faculties of faith, vigour, mindfulness, meditative concentration and wisdom; that these are dominant influences remains in force because they are characterized by the mun- dane path since they are the counteragents to lack of faith etc.	1
Others believe that it is because they are characterized by [the elements] that are conducive to liberation.	1
[7] [There is the dominant influence] of the faculty of understanding what has not been understood etc.	1
in relation to supramundane purity.	1
The fact that this is a dominant influence remains in force.	1
Supramundane purity refers to the relinquishment of moral defilement by means of the supramundane path.	1
In relation to this, there is the dominant influence of three: (a) the faculty of understanding what has not been understood, (b) the faculty of understanding and (c) the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge, for these three are respectively incorporated in the paths of: (a) vision, (b) meditative development and (c) the adept.	1
Therein, with	1
ning with faith as well as mind, happiness, gladness and equanimity, are called: (a) the faculty of understanding what has not been understood, on the path of vision, (b) the faculty of understanding, on the path of meditative development and (c) the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge308, on the path of the adept.	1
[8] However, this arrangement is different for the yogäcāra the faculty of under- standing what has not been understood and the faculty of understanding comprise ten faculties, i.e., there are ten after adding 'sadness' to the nine mentioned above.	1
How- ever, the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge 309 comprises only nine.	1
In this regard, on the path of preparation which consists in the aids to insight³10, and on the fifteen moments of the path of vision, there is the faculty of mind and the five	1
equanimity3 311, as is appropriate according to their differences in being based on the preliminary stage [of the first dhyāna] etc.	0
Furthermore, the faculty of sadness³12	1
ance that follows after the aids to insight, at the time of preparation.	1

The same ten kinds of faculties are described as comprising the faculty of understanding on this the path of one who is still in training, i.e.	1
extending from the sixteen moments of the path of vision up until the vajra-like meditative concentration, because there is nothing to be known that was not previously known.	1
On the path of the adept, the remaining [faculties] with the exception of the faculty of sadness receive the title [collectively]: 'the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge'.	1
Since it is the faculty pertinent to one who possesses perfect knowledge it is [described as] the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge³¹4.	1
In this way the adherence to the belief in a dominant influence in regard to the purușa, the nārāyaṇa or the iśvara is checked for one who is skilled in the facul-	1

Bhasya N47.8.Y158 N47.13 The cause therein refers to the cause of rebirth; the result is that which is incorporated in the rebirth.	0
The experience of the cause is the imparting of the result; the experience of the result is the expiration of what has been experienced.	1
And since such a cause and its result pertain to the past, he says: the past time [should be known] in the sense of the experience of the result and cause317.	1
The future time [should be known] in the sense of the non-experience of the result and cause318 in that same mode.	1
Furthermore, the present319 time, i.e.	1
the present rebirth, should be known in the sense of the experience of the cause, because the cause has produced a result; and in the sense of the non-experience of the result, because this result follows the present rebirth.	1
The determination of the times should be understood as referring to momentariness, for the existing entities, at every instant, possess the nature of cause and result³20.	1
Therein, the experience of the cause is due to the production of its own result.	1
The experience of the result is due to the destruction of the effect³21 immediately following its birth.	1
Thus the subject under discussion is the fact that the past time [should be understood] in the sense of the experience of the result and the cause; the future time [should be understood] in the sense of the non-experience of the result and the cause.	1
The non-experience of the result and its cause should be known as being due to: (a) the non-production³22 of the effect and (b) the absence of the destruction of what has not come into being.	1
The statement: [the present time should be understood] in the sense of the experience of the cause and the non-experience of the result [means]: (a) the experience of the cause is due to the production of the effect and (b) the non-experience of the result is due to the non-destruction of the effect.	1
In this way, the adherence to the belief in the self as something permanent is checked for one who is skillful in the times because he does not perceive anything other apart from the times323.	1

What is next?	1
The four truths.	1
Of these, the truth of suffering [is considered] in the sense of sensation together with its cause, consider- ing that it is said]: "whatever sensation is, in this context it [has the characteristic] of suffering".	1
Furthermore, the cause of sensation should be known as the dharmas that pertain to sensation.	1
The truth of	1
i.e.	1
the practice caused by the truth324 of suffering.	0
The truth of cessa- tion [is considered] in the sense of the appeasement of the [first two.	0
The truth of the path [is considered] in the sense of the counteragent.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] The meaning of the four truths should be mentioned immediately following the meaning of the three times, hence he says: III.21 ab	1
of: (a) sensation together with its cause, (b) the practice325 caused by the latter etc.326 It is generally known that sensation has the sense of suffering; also, according to this statement from a treatise327; "whatever sensation is, in this context it [has the charac- teristic] of suffering".	1
With regard to the respective determination of the [four] truths, all sensation together with its cause, be it pleasurable and accompanied by impurity, painful, or neither pleasurable nor painful, means the truth of suffering; in order to demonstrate this the author of the commentary says: of these, the truth of suffering [is considered] in the sense of sensation together with its cause.	1
Why is it that all sensation is [equivalent to] suffering?	1
He says: consider- ing that³28 [it is said]: "whatever sensation is, in this context it [has the characteristic of suffering".	1
These sensations are [equivalent to] suffering since they have the nature of: (a) the suffering of suffering, (b) the suffering of change and (c) the suffering of the formative forces, respectively.	1
Alternatively, [sensation is equivalent to] suffering on account of just the fact that it has the nature of the suffering of the formative forces.	1
Furthermore, the cause of sensation should be known as the dharmas that pertain to sensation.	1
The dharmas that pertain to	1

nor pain.	1
In this way the five aggregates are explained as the truth of suffering.	1
[2] The truth of origination [is considered in the sense of the practice	1
practice on account of which suffering is brought into being consists in the truth of origination.	1
Moreover, the latter, which has the activities of body, speech and mind for its essential nature, is preceded by the cause of the craving for sensation and the dharmas that pertain to sensation.	1
In brief, it has been said that the truth330 of origina- tion consists in the karma331 that is the source of becoming.	1
[3] The truth of cessation [is considered] in the sense of the appease- ment of the [first] two.	1
The [first] two are the truths of suffering and of origina- tion.	1
The words: "in the sense of the appeasement..." "332 are [equivalent to] 'in the sense of the non-production....	1
Thus, since it is characterized by the non-origination of suffering together with its causes, cessation is described as being twofold: (a) as possessing a remaining substratum in the sense of the appeasement of origination and (b) as not possessing a remaining substratum in the sense of the appeasement of suffering.	1
[4] The truth of the path..., i.e.	1
the way leading to the cessation of both suffering and its origination [is considered] in the sense of the counteragent to these same two which have been referred to, i.e.	1
suffering and its origination.	1
In this way, since one who is skillful in the truths has an understanding of defilement and purifica- tion alone, his adherence to the belief in defilement and purification other than this is checked because [he understands that] it does not exist.	1

The universal vehicle should be known because one goes forth on one's own through direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.	1
[Sthiramati] Y159.15 [1] The meaning of the three vehicles is illustrated immediately following the meaning of the truths, hence he says: III.22 ab- ...Through [the knowledge] of virtues and faults and [direct intu- ition] devoid of conceptual differen- tiation³33 etc.	0
The word "knowledge" is understood with both, i.e.	1
(a) as the knowledge of virtues and faults and (b) as the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.	1
Alterna- tively, the words '[knowledge that consists in conceptual differentiation can be regarded as having been omitted from (a).	1
It should be mentioned that in (a) above [the word "knowledge" has the sense of] the knowledge of virtues and faults after distin- guishing it as [being learnt] from others or on one's own.	1
Since that which is devoid of conceptual differentiation is only learnt by oneself, in the commentary he says:	1
faults of nirväņa and samsāra.	0
The word "nirvāņa" in this context includes both the path and cessation, as does the word "tranquillity".	1
Therein, the knowledge of virtue in relation to nirvana refers to knowledge that is: (a) in the aspects of tranquillity etc.	1
334 in regard to cessation and (b) in the aspects of definitive liberation etc.	1
in regard to the path 335.	0
Although samsāra has the nature of both suffering and its origination, therein, the knowledge of faults in relation to samsāra refers to knowledge that is: (a) in the aspects of impermanence and suffering etc.	1

this context, the term "direct intuition" distinguishes this from the pratyekabuddha vehicle.	1
[4] However, others believe: (a) the śrävaka vehicle is [described as] a going forth through the direct intuition which has the insubstantiality of the personal entity for its object and consists in an absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to virtues and faults, after having learnt from others, (b) the pratyekabuddha vehicle [is described as] a going forth on one's own without dependence upon³40 learning [from others) and (c) the universal vehicle is described as a going forth on one's own through direct intuition which is devoid of conceptual differentiation, having the insubstantiality of the dharmas for its object and leading to the nirvāṇa [in which the bodhisattva is] not per- manently fixed.	0
However this explanation³41 is contradicted by the commentary.	0
In this way the adherence to the belief that the self is a yogi is checked for one who possesses skill in the three vehicles due to the observation that there is just yoga.	1

[The final topic] refers to the conditioned and the unconditioned.	1
The words: "in accompaniment with its designation" in this [verse] refer to the name-group etc.	1
The "cause" refers to that in which the 'seeds' are incorporated, i.e.	1
the store-consciousness.	1
The "causal-sign" refers to that in which the support, the body and experience are incor- porated.	1
Those [elements] that are incorporated in the actual consciousnesses are: (a) mind, (b) apprehending and (c) conceptual differentiation.	1
This the causal-sign, in accompaniment with both its designation and cause together with its associated elements, is to be known as the conditioned.	1
Therein, "mind" refers to the aspect of mental activity that is eternal; "apprehending" refers to the five groups of consciousness; "conceptual differentiation" refers to the mind-con- sciousness because it is this that conceptually differentiates.	1
The unconditioned refers to: (a) cessation which is [equivalent to] tranquillity and (b) the object of tranquillity, i.e.	1
thusness.	0
[Therein, tranquillity refers to both cessation and the path, considering that the former [i.e.	1
cessation] consists in tranquillity and tranquillity is on account of the latter [i.e.	1
the path].	0
Thusness is the object of tran- quillity (prašamārtha), considering that it is the object of tranquillity (praśamasya artha)]342 because thusness is the objective support of the path.	1
Tranquillity belongs to the path because tranquilization [occurs] on account of it.	1
Thus, it is in these meanings that the knowledge in regard to the aggregates etc.	1

The name-group and sentence-group consist in the designation since the own-being and particular of things are designated through the name-groups and sentence groups 345; but the sylla- ble-group consists in the designation because it causes the manifestation of the latter two.	1
The "cause" refers to that in which the 'seeds' are incorporated, i.e.	1
the store-consciousness.	1
The latter, which is endowed with the latent impressions of all impure dharmas and is not the imparted result, is incorporated in the truth of origination.	1
Consequently, in order to distinguish this from the imparted result, he says: "that in which the 'seeds' are incorporated".	1
The "causal-sign" refers to that in which the support, the body346 and experience are incorporated.	1
347 It is the store-consciousness that is referred to.	1
The [elements] incorporated in the actual consciousnesses are: (a) mind, (b) appre- hending and (c) conceptual differentiation348.	0
The "support" in the above refers to the inanimate world, i.e.	1
the store-consciousness in the appearance of the latter.	1
It is incorporated 349 as the support since it is incorporated in its nature as the support.	1
The "body"350 refers to the physical body together with the faculties, i.e.	1
the store-consciousness in the appearance of the latter.	1
It is that in which the body is incorporated; what is meant is: it possesses the body for its nature.	1
It is that in which experience is incorporated this has already been described in the above.	1
It consists in experience³51 since the other consciousnesses experience these two [i.e.	1
the body and experience] as being the dominant entities352.	0
Alternatively, it is experience (bhoga) since food and drink and the like are experienced (bhujyate).	1
That within which expe- rience is incorporated is the [store]-consciousness in the appearance as the latter.	1
This	0
together with its associated elements, is to be known as the conditioned	1

elements" 353 refers to the mental concomitants; he shows that the conditioned is not solely these.	0
But to what does the causal-sign belong?	1
To the name-group etc.	1
because these clearly indicate the own-being and particular of that [causal-sign] and since it is in conformity with these [i.e.	1
the name-group etc.	1
], the causal-sign belongs to the [elements] called mind, apprehending and conceptual differentiation, i.e.	1
the mind and mental concomitants354 of those who are notionally attached to the own-being and the particular.	1
[2] Some believe that mind, apprehending and conceptual differentiation 355 consist in the causal-sign which belongs to the store-consciousness because the nourishment of the latent impressions occurs there.	1
Others again believe that since it designates the own-being and particular, the sign belongs to the designation and consists in concep- tualization (samjñā) because of the statement356 that it has the nature of the apprehen- sion of the sign.	1
The store-consciousness which incorporates the support, the body and experience is the causal-sign of the foundation because there is the nourishment of the latent impressions [therein].	1
Mind, apprehending and conceptual differentiation are also the causal-sign of the objective support because they create the objective support- sign³57; and since it creates the sign in both cases, the causal-sign belongs to both the objective support and the supporter358.	1
[3] Therein, "mind" refers to the aspect of mental activity 359 that is eter- nal; that which eternally thinks (manyate) in terms of 'me' and 'mine' is described as mind (manas).	1
It is associated with: (a) delusion regarding the self, false view of the self, affection for the self and self-conceit and (b) the five all-pervading (dharmas], i.e.	1
sensation, conceptualization, volition, contact and mental attention.	1
"Apprehending" refers to the five groups of consciousness because they have the characteristic of 'seizing the essential nature of the sense-object.	1
Since the latter are to be understood intuitively and cannot be stated, they are described as 'apprehending'.	1
"Conceptual differentiation" refers to mind-consciousness because it is this which conceptually differentiates 360 the characteristic of the dharmas as individual or universal.	1

[4] The unconditioned refers to: (a) cessation which is [equivalent to] tranquillity and (b) that which is the object of tranquillity, i.e.	1
thusness.	0
It is appropriate that cessation has tranquillity for its essential nature because it is char- acterized by the appeasement of suffering together with its causes.	1
Why is thusness described as the object of tranquillity?	1
Considering that it is the object of tranquillity.	1
If thusness362 has no connection whatsoever with cessation, how can it be the object of tranquillity?	1
Because thusness is the objective support of the path.	1
How is it that tranquillity belongs to the path?	1
Because tran- quilization363 [occurs] on account of it.	1
Nirvāṇa is [equivalent to tranquillity because it consists in tranquillity, and since tranquilization364 [occurs] on account of this [i.e.	1
the path], tranquillity refers to ...the path.	1
Thus, from analysing365 the resolution of the compound (i.e.	1
praśamārtha) [it is evident that] both nirvāṇa and the path are referred to through the single expression "tranquillity".	0
But does the truth of the path consist in the conditioned or the unconditioned?	1
It consists in the conditioned because it is to be produced 366.	1
If one were to say that it consists in the unconditioned	1
characterized by the unconditioned, there would be no fault in this.	1
Thus it is in these meanings that the knowledge in regard to the aggregates etc.	1
should be known as the skill in the aggregates etc.	1

The Four Applications of Mindfulness.	1
Now, in regard to these, at the beginning: IV.1 abcd The meditative development of the applications of mindfulness leads to the comprehension of the four truths	0
cause of craving, (c) the foundation [of the latter] and (d) the absence of confusion.	1
(a) Disquiet is made manifest through the body; one comprehends the truth of suffering through the investigation of the latter because [the body] is characterized by the formative forces together with disquiet; for, disquiet consists in the painful nature of the formative forces	1
suffering.	1
(b) The cause of craving is sensation; through the investiga- tion of this, one comprehends the truth of origination.	1
(c) Mind is the foundation for the notional attachment to the self; through the inves- tigation of this, one comprehends the truth of cessation due to the removal of the fear of self-annihilation.	1
(d) Through the investigation of the dharmas one comprehends the truth of the path due to the absence of confusion concerning the dharmas pertinent to defilement and purifi- cation.	1
Hence the meditative development of the applications of mind- fulness is established at the beginning for the comprehension of the four truths.	1
[Sthiramati] Y166.15 [1] Why is the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness described firstly and not the other, i.e.	0
the meditative development of the factors that contribute to enlightenment?	0
He says: Now, in regard to these, in the beginning: IV.1 a ...Due to: (a) disquiet, (b) the cause of craving etc.	0
"In regard to these" [means]: in regard to the meditative development of the factors that contribute to enlightenment.	1
The word "now" has the sense of sequential order.	1
Now, at the beginning, the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness is mentioned and [the meditative development of the others [are mentioned] subse-	1
[respectively] on account of their notional attachment to something pleasurable, pure, permanent and substantial among the formative forces, naive people delight in enjoy- ment and existence and are fearful of the meaning of nirvāṇa7.	0
Moreover, this lack of awareness in regard to virtues and faults and the notional attachment to the pleasurable	1
them to shrink from samsāra and to bring them face to face with nirvāṇa, just the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness is mentioned at the beginning for the comprehension of the four truths.	1
[2] Disquiet is made manifest through the body.	1
Disquiet (dauşthulya) is [equivalent to] uneasiness (duḥsthitatā) because, while it is formatively influenced every day, the body is certainly changed; hence disquiet is made manifest through the body.	0
Consequently, one comprehends the truth of suffering through the investigation of the body.	1
As to why this is so, he says: because [the body] is characterized by the formative forces together with disquiets.	0
Since the formative forces, accompanied by disquiet, are the characteristic, i.e.	1
the own-being, of the truth of suffering and disquiet is made manifest through the body, therefore, one comprehends the truth of suffering through the investigation of the body.	1
However, since disquiet is not understood, he says: for, disquiet consists in the painful nature of the formative forces.	1
Formative force refers to the arising of states [of existence]; and since it is the foundation of all ruin, it is disquiet.	1
And this consists in suffering because it is repugnant to the Noble Ones.	1
As has been said: This rebirth is unfortunate, for when there is birth, there are the enemies of old-age, death, disease, misfortune, murder, bondage and so on.	1
These mis-	1

forces, and not on account of the painful nature of change nor the painful nature of suffering, because: (a) the latter two do not pervade and (b) they are the causes of the painful nature of the formative forces.	1
The Noble Ones regard all impure enti- ties in terms of suffering10 but not [entities] that are free from impurity because	1

people¹2 do not [regard impure entities in terms of suffering] because their mental disposition is impaired by erroneous inversion¹3.	1
The following is stated in a Sūtra too: "In brief, suffering consists in the five aggregates that have been appropriated."	1
Others believe that the painful nature of the formative forces is [equivalent to] the lack of pliability (akarmaṇyata).	0
Others again believe that disquiet does not consist in the lack of pliability 14.	1
What is the reason?	1
The state of being accompanied by impurity should necessarily be acknowledged as having arisen from a causal 'seed' because the lack of pliability15 is accompanied by impurity, however sometimes, even without a 'seed' [lack of pliability] exists in the mental continuum of an arhat due to a defect in diet, or environment¹6 etc.	0
and this does not have the capacity to become disquiet because it is free from impurity.	1
Hence, it is the 'seed' of an impure dharma which lodges in the store-consciousness and is considered as disquiet in this context.	1
This body, accompanied by [sensations that are] pleasurable, painful and neither pleasurable nor painful, is the result of that ['seed'].	1
Therefore, disquiet is made manifest through the body which comes into being every moment accompanied by the state17 of pleasure etc.	1
The term ["made manifest"] is equivalent in meaning to 'made evident'.	1
For example, a seed that has slipped into a crack in the floor of a granary [manifests]18 through its sprout.	0
Therefore, one comprehends the truth of suffering through the investigation of the body.	1
Here now he gives the reason: "because [the body] is char- acterized by the formative forces together with disquiet" 19.	0
What is meant is: because [suffering] consists in the formative forces together with their 'seeds'.	1
For, the painful nature of the formative forces is described as disquiet20 because: (a) it is associated with the disquiet of both the painful nature of change and the painful nature of suffer- ing and (b) it is the cause of these two21.	1
Hence, on account of the painful nature of the formative forces the Noble Ones regard all impure entities in terms of suffering22.	1
In this way one comprehends the truth of suffering through the application of the mind- fulness of the body.	1

The intended meaning here is that it arises from contact which consists in ignorance, because [sensation] that is free from impurity does not cause such[ craving].	1
In this respect, a pleasurable sensation is the cause of the craving for connection with that [sensation] and non-separation from it.	1
A painful [sensation] is the cause of the craving for separation from that (sensation] and non-connection with it.	1
[A sensation that is neither pleasurable nor painful is the cause of: (a) craving for the delight in that state and (b) craving for connection with that [sensation] and non-separation from it23 in regard to any attainment.	1
Even a painful sensation is a cause of craving for pleasure since it is said that: "one who has made contact24 with a painful sensation rejoices in the pleasure of sensual delight."	1
One comprehends the truth of origination through the investigation of this.	1
While investigating sensation by way of essential nature, cause, effect, impermanence25 and suffering, one indeed comprehends the truth of origination.	1
What is meant is: one understands that craving is the effect of these [sensations].	1
In a Sūtra, craving is described as the truth of origination; in detail it is said: "What is the origination of suffering?	1
It is the craving which leads to further existence and which is accompanied by the passion for joy.	1
"2 In this way one comprehends the truth of origination through the application of the mindfulness of sensation.	1
[4] Mind is the foundation for the notional attachment to the self.	1
Since there is no other self that is distinguished by the quality of permanence etc., the objec- tive support for the notional attachment to the self is mind alone.	1
Therefore, through the investigation of this, one comprehends the truth of cessation, i.e.	1
as tranquillity.	1
Here now he provides the reason: due to the removal of the fear of self-annihilation.	1
For the notional attachment to the self is checked by investigat- ing impermanence etc.	1
in regard to mind, and its perception as suffering arises.	1
Hence, due to the removal of the fear of self-annihilation, one comprehends the truth of cessa- tion as tranquillity 27 because it is [equivalent to] the annihilation of suffering alone.	0
In this way one comprehends the truth of cessation through the application of the mind- fulness of mind 28.	1

love and friendliness etc., are the counteragents to the moral defilements and secondary defilements 29.	1
Having become aware of the nature of the [respective] adverse elements and counteragents to those [dharmas] that pertain to defilement and purification, one comes face to face with the expedient for the absolute relinquishment of all distress, i.e.	1
the truth of the path.	1
In this way one comprehends the truth of the path through the application of the mindfulness of the dharmas.	1
[6] "Comprehension" in the above refers to the understanding of the characteristic of truth in regard to each of the [four] truths.	1
Therein, the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness of the body refers to [its understanding] as: (a) imperma- nent, painful, empty and insubstantial, (b) having many impure substances for its own- (c) the 'seed' of the impure, (d) the outflow of the ure, (e) the cause of continued existence of impurity, (f) a modification into impurity, (g) the absence of essence, like a mass of foam, (h) a state of existence and (i) a place of birth.	0
Further- more, the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness of sensation, mind and the dharmas refers to [their understanding] as: (a) impermanent, painful, empty and insubstantial, (b) an individual characteristic, (c) a universal characteristic³0, (d) a cause, (e) a result, (f) a realm of existence, spiritual level and state of existence, (g) wholesome, unwholesome and undefined and (h) adverse elements and counteragents.	0
For the bodhisattvas however, the meditative development of the applications of mind- fulness for the purpose of the relinquishment of conceptual differentiation is both in this way [as described] and is also in the aspect of non-perception.	0
Although the applications of mindfulness have wisdom for their own-being, the term "applications of mindfulness" is so-called because [the wisdom elements] are applied by the force of mindfulness, or, mindfulness is applied by means of these [wisdom elements ] ³1.	1

a fourfold vigour arises according to its differentiation as an adverse element or counteragent, which has already arisen or has not yet arisen.	1
In detail, these are for the relinquishment of the evil, unwholesome dharmas that have already arisen.	1
By this he shows the fourfold arising of	1
that have already arisen]40 one generates will-power, makes endeavour, undertakes with vigour, 'seizes' the mind and strives with correct effort.	1
Thus, in detail: one generates will-power for the non-production of the evil, unwholesome dharmas that have not yet arisen.	1
Similarly, in detail: one generates will-power for the production of the wholesome dharmas that have not yet arisen.	1
For the maintenance, increase, [non- deprivation]41 and completion of the wholesome dharmas that have already arisen, one generates will-power, makes endeavour, undertakes with vigour, 'seizes' the mind and strives with correct effort.	1
The maintenance of those that have arisen refers to their non-decrease42.	1
Increase is [equivalent to] continuous production; completion is [equivalent to] culmination.	1
By the rds: "one generates will-power", he shows that it is an earnest application of the meditative development of vigour43.	0
By "one makes endeavour" is meant: one focuses on the body and mind for the relinquishment of lazi- ness44.	1
"One undertakes with vigour", in order to dispel both indolence and excitabil- ity.	1
How does one undertake?	1

IV.3 abcd [Sthiramati] c. The Four Bases of Psychic Power.	0
The pliability of the stability of mind in the context of that medita- tive development of the vigour for the removal and production of those [dharmas] 49 consists in the four bases of psychic power because they are the causes of mental power in all subjects, Stability, which refers to the stability of mind here, should be known as meditative concentra- tion.	1
Hence, the bases of psychic power follow immediately after the correct exertions.	1
Furthermore, this pliability is to be known as following from the meditative development of the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment leading to the relinquishment of the five faults.	1

to] the capacity for mental power in all subjects and this pliability comes about under the influence of will-power, vigour, mind and examination.	1
Hence he says: pliability consists in the four bases of psychic power.	1
Psychic power is [equivalent to] mental power in all subjects such as the higher knowledges.	1
These are the bases of psychic power in the sense that they are the support for it - what is meant is: the bases of psychic power are the causes of psychic power53.	1
Hence he says: because they are the causes of mental power.	1
Moreover, they are: (a) the base of psychic power associated with the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in the meditative concentration of will-power.	1
(b) The base of psychic power associated with the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in the meditative concentration of vigour.	1
(c) The base of psychic power associated with the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in the meditative concentration of mind.	1
(d) The base of psychic power associated with the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in the meditative concentration of examination.	1
Of these, (a) the meditative concentration of will-power occurs when one attains single-pointedness of mind while earnestly engaging in the meditative development of vigour under the influence of will-power.	1
(b) The meditative concen- tration of vigour occurs when one attains single-pointedness of mind while undertak- ing with vigour due to continual application.	1
(c) The meditative concentration of mind occurs when one attains single-pointedness of mind while holding the mind on mind alone owing to the 'seed' of previous meditative concentration.	1
(d) The meditative con- centration of examination occurs when one who has thoroughly analysed the objective support attains single-pointedness of mind.	1
Stability, which refers to the stability of mind here, should be known as meditative concentration; the reference to meditative concentration is for the purpose of distinguishing this from those [states] characterized by the conditioned elements.	1
The pliability of mind 54 pertinent to one who has undertaken with vigour consists in the four bases of psychic power; hence 55, the bases of psychic power are explained immediately.	1

quishment leading to the relinquishment of the five faults.	1
The term "following from" is [equivalent in meaning to] 'cause'58.	1
Which are the five faults?	1
He says:	0
instructions, (c) indolence and excitability 59, (d) the absence of for- mative influence and (e) formative influence these are considered as the five faults.	1
IV.4 abcd In the above, indolence and excitability are made one fault.	0
The absence of formative influence is a fault at the time of the tranquilliza- tion of indolence and excitability.	1
Formative influence [is a fault] at [the time of] tranquillity.	1
[Sthiramati] Y173.11 [1] Since these five faults are not known, he asks: which are the five faults 260 In order to demonstrate them he says: IV.4 ab (a) Laziness, (b) the forgetting of instructions, (c) indolence and excitability 61 etc.	1
Since these faults number six, he says: in the above, indolence and excitability are made one fault thus there are five.	1
Of these, laziness is a fault at the time of application because the absence of application is on account of it.	1
The forgetting of instructions is a fault on the part of one who has undertaken [to act] because the absence of the concentration of mind is on account of it.	1
Indolence / excitability is a fault on the part of one whose mind is concentrated because the absence of pliability of mind is on account of this.	1

Formative influence [is a fault] at [the time of] tranquillity; [the word] "fault" remains in force.	1
Forma- tive influence consists in volition, for it is said that tranquillity is due to the attainment of 'sameness' (samatā) which is because of the removal of indolence and excitability.	1
The Eight Formative Forces that Facilitate Relinquishment.	1
How are the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment respectively determined for the relinquishment of those [faults]?	1
Four are for the relinquishment of laziness, namely: (a) will-power, (b) effort, (c) faith and (d) quiescence.	1
Moreover, these should be known sequentially as: IV.5 ab (a) Will-power is the basis of effort.	1
(b) Effort is that which is based [on will-power].	1
(c) Faith is the cause of that basis, i.e.	1
will- power, because there is an eagerness in one who has firm belief.	1
(d) Quiescence is the result of that which is based [on will-power], i.e.	1
effort, because one who undertakes with vigour attains a special medi- tative concentration.	1
on it, (c) the cause of the former and (d) the result;	1
ment, namely, (a) mindfulness, (b) full awareness, (c) volition and (d) equanimity which are the counteragents to the [other] four faults as enumerated.	1
Furthermore, they should be known sequentially, begin- ning with mindfulness: IV.S cdef (a) the non-loss64 of the objective support, (b) the understanding of indolence and excitability, (c) the formative influence for the removal of the latter and (d) the employment of meditative calm when appease- ment occurs.	0

(c) Volition is the formative influence for the removal of the latter [two] after they have been understood.	1
(d) The employment of meditative calm refers to the equanimity of mind that occurs when that indolence and excitability are appeased.	1
[Sthiramati] Y174.4 [1] [The term]: 'formative forces that facilitate relinquishment' (prahäṇa-samskäräḥ)65 is [resolved as]: 'formative forces that lead to relinquishment (prahāṇāya samskäräh) [i.e.	0
as a tatpuruşa compound].	0
They are for the relinquishment of what?	1
For the relinquishment of the five faults that have just been described.	1
If so, then this should be stated: How are the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment respectively determined for the relinquishment of those66 [faults]?	1
Of these, four are for the relinquishment of laziness, namely: (a) will- power, (b) effort, (c) faith and (d) quiescence.	1
Will-power therein is [equivalent to] eagerness; effort is [equivalent to] vigour; faith is [equivalent to] firm belief; and quiescence is [equivalent to] pliability.	1
Just how are they respectively determined as leading to the relinquishment of laziness?	1
Hence he says: moreover,	1
IV.5 ab (a) The basis, (b) that which is based on it, (c) the cause of the former and (d) the result;	1
arise 67 one from the other.	0
(a) Will-power is the basis of effort.	1
(b) Effort is that which is based [on will-power], because eagerness is preceded by effort.	1
(c) Faith is the cause of that basis68, i.e.	1
will-power... How so?	1
He says: ...because there is an eagerness in one who has firm belief, for, one who possesses faith in regard to the cause and result is eager to act.	0
Quiescence is the result of that which is based [on will-power], i.e.	1
effort.	1
How so?	1
He says: ...because one who undertakes with vigour attains a special meditative concentration; for the attainment of a special meditative concentration is the cause of quiescence.	1
Hence quiescence is described as the result of effort	1

and mind that results from a joyous mind has the characteristic70 of pliability; conse- quently, it is described as: "the attainment of a special meditative concentration".	1
Moreover, in this context, it is vigour together with its cause and result that is described as the counteragent71 to laziness.	1
namely: (a) mindfulness, (b) full awareness, (c) volition and (d) equa- nimity are the counteragents to the [other] four faults as enumerated.	1
Of these, mindfulness is the counteragent to the forgetting of instructions.	1
Full aware- ness is [the counteragent] to indolence and excitability.	1
Volition is [the counteragent} to the absence of formative influence.	1
Equanimity is [the counteragent] to formative influence; in this context it is the equanimity that consists in the formative forces that is to be understood.	1
Moreover, since he wishes to discuss the characteristic of mindful- ness etc.	1
here, he says: furthermore, they should be known sequentially, beginning with mindfulness.	0
[mindfulness refers to:] IV.5 c (a) non-loss of an objective support (a) Mindfulness is the non-loss of an objective support; what is meant is: the expression of the content of an instruction conducive to the stability of mind 72.	1
Full awareness is the understanding of indolence and excitability when there is no loss of mindfulness, for, one for whom mindfulness is present possesses full awareness; this why he says: "when there is no loss of mindfulness".	1
After they are understood, i.e.	1
indolence and excitability; what is meant is: [full awareness] arises effortlessly due to the coupling of the two, i.e.	1
meditative calm and penetrating insight.	1
By "equanimity" is meant: the absence of formative influence in regard to other objects.	1
This is what is being said: one for whom mindfulness is present understands the sluggish or excited mind, as it is in reality, when instruction [is given]; and in order to be rid of indolence and excitability he formatively influences that [mind].	1
Also, due to the disappearance of both indolence and excitability, equa- nimity is created.	1

IV.6 abcd When the elements that are con- ducive to liberation are fostered, it is due to the influence of: (a) will- power, (b) application, (c) non-loss74 of the objective support, (d) non-dif- fusion and (e) analysis.	0
The words: "from the influence of" remain in force [in each case].	1
When the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation has been fostered by the bases of psychic power in one who has mental pliability, it is due to: (a) the influence of will-power, (b) the influence of application, (c) the influence of the non-loss of the objective support, (d) the influence of non-diffusion and (e) the influence of thorough analysis.	1
The five faculties beginning with faith should be known in sequential order.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] It is the fact that the five faculties beginning with faith were described immediately after the bases of psychic power that is referred to.	1
How are they respectively established?	1
The intended meaning is: in what sense [are they respectively established]?	1

this statement he shows that the term "influence" employed here, i.e.	0
in the phrase "it is due to the influence of: (a) will-power, (b) application...", remains in force for each subsequent [faculty] as well.	1
When the root of the wholesome which is con- ducive to liberation has been fostered76 by the bases of psychic power in	1
to liberation finds a support in the mental continuum 77 of one who has mental pliability.	0
...It is due to: (a) the influence of will-power etc., concluding with (e) the influence of thorough analysis; but not in one who does not have mental pliabil- ity.	1
Moreover, this mental pliability comes about through the bases of psychic power.	1
Therefore, immediately after the bases of psychic power, the five faculties beginning with faith are respectively determined as being due to the influence of the fostering of	1
referred to by the term "will-power" in the statement: "...from the influence of will- power", for, the effect is expressed figuratively here in regard to the cause [i.e.	1
will- power is the cause of faith].	1
Just as, for example, [the eating of] yoghurt and melon [which is the cause] is [figuratively described as] a sudden fever.	1
Alternatively, belief, serene faith, and eagerness respecively with regard to existence, the possession of virtue 78 and ability are the characteristics of faith.	1
Hence, through the reference to will- power79 in this context, it is actually faith as characterized by eagerness that is referred to and not will-power.	1
(b) The influence of application; it is application (prayoga) since one applies oneself (prayujyate) by means of this.	1
By the word 'application', it is vigour that is intended.	1
(c) The influence of the non-loss 80 of	1
faculty of mindfulness is characterized by the distinct expression of the objective	1
faculty of meditative concentration, for, non-diffusion consists in the faculty of medita- tive concentration because this is characterized by single-pointedness of mind.	1
And (e) the influence of thorough analysis; i.e.	1
due to the influence of the faculty of wisdom because the faculty of wisdom has the nature of the thorough analysis of the dharmas.	1
The word "and" shows that the five faculties beginning with faith82 should be known in sequential order because they are the influences in the	1

One who has faith undertakes with vigour in order to escape from the prison of samsăra, and, since one who has undertaken with vigour84 accomplishes the three teachings, the faculties of mindfulness, meditative concentration and wisdom follow in sequential order.	1
Thus, at the level of application on the path of vision, the faculties are consid- ered to be of central importance.	1
nourishment of the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation.	1
Rather, they are described as faculties because when the root of the wholesome which is con- ducive to liberation is nourished, faith etc.	1
exercise influence.	1
It is in order to demon- strate just this that he says: "due to the influence of will-power", faith is a faculty; the latter is to be supplied.	1
Application is [equivalent to] performance.	1
Not forgetting [or non-loss; asammoșa; asampramoșa] is [equivalent to the non-disappearance of the objective support.	1
Non-diffusion is [equivalent to] non-dispersion.	1
Analysis 85 is [equivalent to] thorough analysis.	0
The mental concomitants called vigour, mindful- ness, meditative concentration and wisdom are termed faculties because of their influ- ence over application, non-forgetfullness, non-diffusion and thorough analysis.	1
How- ever, the following should be stated in this regard: when the root of the wholesome	1
being, in comparison with the unnourised state86, between the influence of will-power etc.	1
and faith etc.87 because at that time they are established as faculties due to their influence over it [i.e.	1
the root of the wholesome].	1
These same [elements], i.e.	1
faith etc., are described as the powers when they possess power.	1

Why is there an initial and subsequent explanation of faith etc.?	1
Because: the latter is the result of the former;	1
cause and result.	1
Mindfulness is present for one who has undertaken with vigour; the mind of one for whom mindfulness is present becomes concentrated; one whose mind is concentrated understands [phenomena] as they are in reality.	1
The faculties that pertain to the elements which are conducive to liberation, and which have been nourished, have now been described.	1
Now, should the elements that are conducive to penetration be known as being in the state of a 'faculty' or in the state of a 'power'?	1
IV.7 cd The elements conducive to penetra- tion are in twos, i.e.	1
both faculties and powers.	1
The [state of] heat and the summit are faculties; the receptivities and highest mundane realizations are powers.	1
[Sthiramati] Y177.22 [1] These same [elements], i.e.	0
faith etc., which are discussed immediately after the faculties, are described as the powers when they possess power.	1
Moreover, their possession of power is due to what?	1
Hence he says: IV.7 a Due to the curbing of adverse ele- ments;	0
when these faculties such as faith are not intermixed with adverse elements such as lack of faith, i.e.	1
with lack of faith88, laziness, forgetfulness, distraction89 and lack of full awareness which are adverse to faith etc.	1
; what is meant is: they do not intermingle [with adverse elements] because, being extremely attenuated they do not manifest time and again at that time they are described as 'powers'.	0
These faculties are intermixed with adverse elements at that time because the elements that are adverse to them have not been erased.	1
[2] If the faculties are possessed of adverse elements that have not been subdued, how then, can faith etc.	1
be described as 'faculties' by way of the influence of mundane purity in [Chapter III.	0
10 titled] 'The Reality of the Skills'?	0
Because in that section the faculties	1
Ms.(57a.7): -vikşepa-; disregard Y's fn.2 p.178.Y179	0
demonstrate the differentiation of the root of the wholesome which is conducive to penetration therefore there is no contradiction.	1
Only hence does he say: "these same faculties...are described as 'powers".	1
[3] For, one who possesses faith undertakes with vigour in regard to the cause and result90; i.e.	1
he connects the cause with its respective result and vice versa.	1
Thus, because of his faith in the result, one who possesses faith undertakes with vigour in regard to the cause.	1
Mindfulness is present for one who has undertaken with vigour because it depends upon the latter91.	1
The mind of one for whom mindfulness is present becomes concentrated, i.e.	1
it becomes single-pointed because there is no distraction.	1
One whose mind is concentrated understands [phenomena] as they are in reality; i.e.	1
the wisdom that is assisted by meditative concentration becomes pure.	1
The faculties that pertain to the elements which are conducive to liberation, and which have been nourished 92, have now been described.	1
[4] The elements which are conducive to penetration follow immediately after the elements which are conducive to liberation and the powers follow immediately after the faculties, hence this should be stated: should the elements conducive to pene- tration be known as being in the state of a 'faculty' or in the state of a 'power¹937 Similarly, do the essential natures of the faculties and the powers consist in the elements that are conducive to penetration, or are their essential natures separate from them?	1
Hence, [answering] all of these [questions] he says: IV.7 cd The elements conducive to penetra- tion are in twos: both faculties and powers.	1
Alternatively, in the same way that the elements that are conducive to liberation are characterized by the meditative development of the counteragent, or are characterized by faith etc., so too are the elements that are conducive to penetration; consequently, he says: "the faculties that pertain to the elements which are conducive to liberation, and which have been nourished 94, have now been described etc."	1
Hence he then says: "the elements conducive to penetration are in twos".	1

The receptivities and highest mundane real- izations are powers.	1
The receptivities and highest mundane realizations are definitely powers for it is impossible that these can be faculties because of their strength.	1
Moreover, faith etc.	1
are threefold according to their differentiation as weak, middling and strong.	1
The weak and middling of these are the faculties and the strong are the powers.	1
Those that are weak are the [states of] heat; the middling are the summits.	1
However the strong therein are divided into four: the weak, the middling and the strong are, respectively, the weak, middling and strong receptivities; while the strongest of the strong are the highest mundane realizations.	1
Moreover, all99 of these elements that are conducive to penetration 100, together with their associated elements, have meditative concentration and wisdom for their essential nature; the aspect of heat in the latter is the [state of] heat.	1
For example, from the rubbing together of kindling sticks, heat is produced which is the first mark of the arising (utpatti-cihna) of the fire which has the capacity to burn that [fuel].	1
Similarly, the [state of] heat is so-called101 because its nature precedes the 'fire' of the noble path which has the capacity to consume the 'fuel' of all moral defilement.	1
The summit [is so-called] since it extends up until the summit away from fickle roots of the wholesome.	1
The receptivities [are so-called] because they consist in perseverance in the meaning of the [four] truths.	1
The highest mundane realizations are so-called because they are accompanied by impurity and also because they are foremost among the other impure dharmas.	1
Their pre- eminence is due to the fact that the origination of the path of vision occurs immediately after [the realization of them.	1
Moreover, they are momentary, [whereas] the other elements that are conducive to penetration are continuous.	1
In the above, the root of the wholesome [the realization of] which is conducive to liberation, should be known as the yoga that destroys the power that causes samsāra to come into being.	1
[The realiza- tion of those conducive to penetration [should be known] as the yoga that generates the power for the arising of dharmas that are not accompanied by impurity.	1

considered as threefold.	1
The limbs of enlightenment refer to the limbs that lead to enlighten- ment on the path of vision.	1
Of these, (a) the limb of the basis of enlightenment refers to mindfulness.	1
(b) The limb of own-being refers to the analysis of the dharmas.	1
(c) The limb of setting forth refers to vigour.	1
(d) The limb of advantage refers to delight.	1
(e) The limb of the	1
tive concentration and equanimity.	1
But why is the limb of the absence of defilement taught as threefold?	1
IV.9 ab It is taught by way of: (a) the underlying cause, (b) the basis and (c) the own-being; (a) The underlying cause of the absence of defilement refers to quiescence because defilement is caused by disquiet and [quiescence] is the counteragent to the latter.	1
(b) The basis refers to meditative concentration.	1
(c) The own-being refers to equanimity.	1
[Sthiramati] Y180.10 [1] Since the path of vision arises immediately after the highest [mundane] realizations and because it is characterized by the limbs of enlightenment, he says: the limbs of enlightenment follow immediately after the powers.	0
How are they established 102?	1
The intended meaning is: for what purpose are they established?	1
Hence he says: IV.8 a (a) The limb of the basis, (b) the limb of own-being etc.	1
The limbs of enlightenment refer the limbs that lead to enlightenment on the path of vision.	1
It is [described as] vision (darśana) since [the aspirant] has	1
N53.13.Y181	0
it causes the attainment of the noble spiritual levels it is the path (märga); hence it is described as the path of vision (darśana-marga).	1
For, in the state of [the realization of] the elements that are conducive to penetration 103, the [four] truths are perceived as though concealed by a ine silken cloth; [whereas] in the state of the path of vision, it is as though that [cloth] has been removed.	1
In the above, enlightenment104, which refers to the perfect comprehension of reality, consists in the direct intuition that is free from conceptual differentiation.	1
With regard to that, the six beginning with mindfulness are [described as] its limbs because they are in conformity with enlightenment.	1
However, the analysis of the dharmas is (equivalent to] enlightenment because it has the nature of understanding 105 and it is a 'limb' because it is a 'companion' to the others 106.	1
Another [school] believes that the analysis of the dharmas, which is included in the path that brings an immediate result (änantarya-märga), is [only] a limb of enlightenment but that [analysis] which is included in the path of liberation (vimukti-mārga) [equivalent to] enlightenment.	0
[2] Of these, (a) the limb of the basis of enlightenment107 refers to mindfulness; because the absence of distraction in regard to an objective support is	1
analysis of the dharmas; because enlightenment has direct intuition for its own-	1
(c) The limb of setting forth refers to vigour; because the level of ordinary people is completely transcended through vigour.	1
(d) The limb of	1
account of this.	1
(e) The limb of the absence of defilement which is three- fold refers to: quiescence, meditative concentration and equanimity because these are counteragents to defilement.	1
Alternatively, it is because they are differentiated as the underlying cause, the basis and the own-being of the absence of defilement.	1
[3] But why is the limb of the absence of defilement taught as three- fold?	1
The intended meaning is: in what sense is it taught as threefold?	1

The underlying cause (nidäna) is [equivalent to] the cause [kāraṇa].	1
As to why it is the underlying cause, he says: because defilement is caused by disquiet and because	1
[quiescence] is the underlying cause of the absence of defilement because it is the counteragent to the underlying cause of defilement.	1
Disquiet consists in physical and mental inefficiency; when this exists, mind becomes distracted because single-pointed- ness of the mind is impossible.	1
Moreover, defilement, such as passion, arises in one whose mind is distracted; thus, disquiet is the cause of defilement.	1
The counteragent to that disquiet is quiescence.	1
How so?	1
Because quiescence brings about physical and mental efficiency¹12.	1
In this way quiescence is determined to be the underlying cause of the absence of defilement.	1
(b) The basis refers to meditative concentra- tion.	1
The mind is concentrated in one whose body and mind are assisted by quies- cence; when the mind becomes concentrated, one understands [phenomena] as they are in reality and moral defilement is relinquished because one sees them as they are in reality.	1
Thus, the basis of the absence of defilement is meditative concentration.	1
(c) The own-being refers to equanimity because this is the counteragent to: (a) mind's unevenness, (b) mind's absence of meditative calm and (c) mind's state of effort 13, all of which are conformable to the defiled condition.	1
Thus, the own-being of the absence of defilement is equanimity.	1
[4] However, others believe that when defilement which is to be relinquished through vision has been relinquished by means of the paths of relinquishment114, wisdom is generated ¹15 that is free from the encumbrances of that defilement, is pure in its own- being, is incorporated in the path of liberation¹16 and is positively determined in regard to the knowable.	1
That wisdom is described as equanimity in this context since one shows equanimity in thinking: "there is extinction in regard to extinction", because what is to be done has been done.	1

The limbs for the attainment of others are correct intention and correct speech because their attainment is on account of speech together with that which causes its arising.	1
The limbs for the confidence of others are threefold: correct speech, correct action and correct livelihood, for, by means of these	1

The limb that is the counteragent to adverse elements is threefold: correct effort, correct mindfulness and correct meditative concentration, for, these are respectively: IV.11 ab The counteragents to: (a) moral defilement, (b) secondary defilement Read: bhavanamarge darsanamärgasya paricchedangam which accords with both the Tib.	1

[Sthiramati] [1] The limbs of the path follow immediately after the limbs of enlight- enment.	1
How are they respectively established?	1
The path of meditative development follows immediately after the path of vision and since the limbs of the path are included therein, the limbs of the path are described immediately following the limbs of enlightenment.	1
In what sense are they respectively established?	1
Hence he says: IV.9 c ...(a) Accurate determination, (b) the causing of attainment¹19 etc.	1
The eight limbs of the path¹20, beginning with correct view, are respectively established as being adverse to [the eight beginning with] false view and concluding with false meditative concentration.	1
Their sequential order is in accordance with their order of efficacy 121; in detail, they consist in the path of meditative development.	1
It is the path of meditative development (bhāvanā-märga) since it is cultivated (bhavyate) through the frequent exercise of meditative development (niṣevaṇa-bhāvanā).	1
[2] On that path of meditative development, the limb for the accurate determination of the path of vision which is cultivated through meditative development that has been attained is mundane correct view; it is mundane since it is accompanied by conceptual differentiation.	1
It is determined [as such] even for one	1

Although devoid of conceptual differentiation123, it is described as correct view since it is the basis of correct view; hence he says: ...which is obtained subsequently to the supramundane.	1
What is meant is: [correct view] is obtained, i.e.	1
has arisen, subsequently, i.e.	1
through the force of 24, the supramundane path of vision.	1
But what is its object?	1
Hence he says: ...by means of this, one accurately determines one's own understanding, i.e.	1
one's understanding of the path of vision insofar as one thinks: "I understand thus".	1
It is described as correct view because it has the path of vision for its object.	1
[3] The limbs for the attainment of others; in detail: the limbs for the attain- ment of others ...are correct intention and correct speech because, by means of correct speech and correct intention, others attain [the realization of] a reality that has been accurately determined through correct view.	1
Hence he says: because their attainment is on account of speech together with that which causes its arising; for, correct intention causes the arising of [correct] speech because of this statement from a Sutra: "one does not utter a word without having conjectured and deliberated", 125 Moreover, one who is concentrated should be known as being endowed with these two [qualities] because he acquires the capacity to produce them; however, one who is concentrated neither speculates nor speaks.	1
[4] The limbs for the confidence of others are threefold: correct speech, correct action and correct livelihood.	1
How so?	1
He says: for, by means of these, i.e.	1
by means of correct speech126, action and livelihood, respectively: IV.10 cd It is considered that another is informed 127 in regard to vision, morality and austerity.	0

[One has confidence] in morality on account of correct action; [the words]: "one has confidence" remain in force.	1
Why [does one have confidence in morality...]?	1
He says: because one does not perform action that should not be performed.	1
Correct action is contrary to evil conduct; hence, one who is endowed with 30 this does not perform action that should not be per- formed, even for the sake of his life.	1
Consequently, since such a person possesses morality that is pleasing to the Noble Ones, one has confidence in him.	1

For, moral defilement that is to be relinquished by means of meditative development is the first adverse element; correct effort is the counteragent to that.	1
How so?	1
He says: since the meditative development of the path is on account of that, i.e.	1
is on account of correct effort.	1
Correct effort is [equivalent to] vigour which is taken possession of by correct view and remains in meditative concentration free from indolence and excitability¹37.	1
By means of this, with the aim of relinquishing the moral defilements which are to be relinquished through meditative development, one cultivates the path as the counteragent to them; thus, correct effort is described as the counteragent to the first because it causes the accomplishment of correct meditative concentration.	1
In the context of that same meditative development of the path, correct mindfulness [is the counteragent] to the second, i.e.	1
secondary defilement which is characterized by indolence and excitability; [the term] "counteragent" needs to be supplied.	1
Why [is correct mindfulness the counteragent]?	1
He says: because one who has properly applied mindfulness in regard to the causal-signs of tranquillization etc.	1
is free from indolence and excitability 138; by the word "etc.	1
"139 the causal- sign of exertion and the causal-sign of equanimity are also to be understood.	1
Tranquil- lization in this regard is due to the appeasement of the causal-sign of distraction.	1
The causal-sign (nimitta) of tranquillization etc.	1
is [equivalent to] the cause (kärapa) of tranquillization etc.	0
With regard to this, when mind is excited or is suspected of becoming excited, mental attention directed towards an entity that is apt to cause a 'shuddering'!	1
140 is the causal-sign of tranquillization.	1
When mind is sluggish or is suspected of becoming lethargic, mental attention directed towards an entity that is apt to cause delight is the causal-sign of exertion.	1
When the path is devoted exclusively to tranquillity or is devoted exclusively to insight¹41, or when it combines both of these, the impassive mental attention directed towards that which is defiled¹42 by the former two secondary defilements is the causal-sign of equanimity.	1
That which is adverse to supremacy 143 which consists in the qualities such as the higher knowledges is unde- filed nescience144 which consists in the obscuration to the attainments.	1

Therefore, he has stated that: (a) dissociation from obscura- tion that consists in moral defilement is by way of correct effort, (b) the complete purification of meditative concentration is by way of correct mindfulness and (c) separation from obscuration to the attainments 147 is by way of correct meditative concentration.	1

(a) Although erroneously inverted, it conforms with the absence of erroneous inversion; (b) although not erroneously inverted, it is con- nected with erroneous inversion; and (c) it is not erroneously inverted and is free from connection with erroneous inversion.	1
These relate respectively to the state of: (i) ordinary people, (ii) those in training and (iii) the adepts.	1
However, for the bodhisattvas: IV.12 cd A distinction is made in terms of: (a) objective support, (b) mental atten- tion and (c) attainment.	0
For, the objective supports of the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas are the body etc.	1
belonging to their own mental continuum.	1

mental continuum as well as that of others.	1
The śrävakas and pratyeka- buddhas are mentally attentive of their body etc.	1
in the aspects of impermanence etc.	1
However, the bodhisattvas [are mentally attentive] in the manner of non-perception.	1
The śrävakas and pratye kabuddhas cultivate the applications of mindfulness etc.	1
only insofar as they lead to the dissociation of the body etc.	1
The bodhisattvas do not (cultivate the latter] for the purpose of dissociation, nor for non-dissociation, [they cultivate them] up until the [attainment of the] nirvana in which they are not permanently fixed.	1
The meditative development of the counteragent has now been described.	1
[Sthiramati] 185.21 [1] That meditative development of the counteragent should be known summarily as threefold, according to its differentiation as: (a) an undertaking, (b) something obtained and (c) completion; however, in detail it is of various kinds.	1
How	0
[Meditative development as]: (a) conformable but erroneously inverted etc.	0
In this respect, (a) although erroneously inverted, it conforms with the absence of erroneous inversion.	1
The absence of erroneous inversion refers to the path of vision because it has reality for its object and since it conforms with the latter, it conforms with the absence of erroneous inversion.	1
Moreover, this is the med- itative development of ordinary people, thus, it is erroneously inverted because it does not have reality for its object; i.e.	1
because ordinary people have not relinquished moral defilement in its entirety.	1
How can it conform with the absence of erroneous inversion when it is erroneously inverted?	1
Because it has arisen¹49 from the latent impressions of what is learnt which flows out of the extremely pure dharmadhātu.	1
And this begins with the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness and concludes with the meditative development of the powers.	1
(b) Although not erroneously inverted, it is connected with erroneous inversion.	1
This is equivalent to the meditative development of the limbs of enlightenment and the medita- tive development of the path, and is pertinent to those still in training.	1
It is not erroneously inverted because it has reality for its object and it is connected with erro- neous inversion because of the presence of moral defilement which is to be relin- quished through meditative development.	1
(c) It is not erroneously inverted and	1
tive development of the path pertinent to the adepts, i.e.	1
the arhats 150.	0
It is not erro- neously inverted because it has reality for its object; it is not connected with erroneous inversion and is pertinent to the arhat because he has relinquished all stain.	1
[2] Now, in order to demonstrate the distinction between the meditative development of the counteragent for the bodhisattvas in contrast to that of the śrāvakas etc., he says: however, for the bodhisattvas: IV.12 cd A distinction is made in terms of: (a) objective support, (b) mental atten- tion and (c) attainment.	1
151 Therein, there is a distinction152 in terms of objective support, for, the objective supports, i.e.	1
the body, sensation, mind and the dharmas, of the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas are the body etc.	1
with its own mental continuum.	1
However, the objective supports, i.e.	0
the body, sensation, mind and the dharmas, for the bodhisattvas are [those things] belonging to their own mental con- tinuum as well as that of others.	1
Why do they have different objective supports?	1
Because it is with reference to just their own benefit that the śråvakas etc.	1
engage in the meditative development of the counteragent; however, for the bodhisattvas, it is with reference to both their own benefit and that of others.	1
In the	0
the empty and the insubstantial.	1
Why is the mental attention of the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas [applied] thus in [the aspect of the impermanent etc.?	1
In order to generate aversion for the latter because one who is not averse does not dissociate from them.	1
The bodhisattvas [arementally attentive] in the manner of non- perception; what is meant is: in the modes of the non-perception of the imaginary nature.	1
Why are they mentally attentive in this way?	1
In order to relinquish all concep- tual differentiation - this is said to be peculiar to them.	1
Not only are they mentally atten- tive in the manner of non-perception but also in the aspects of the impermanent etc.	1
Thus, a distinction is made because of the differences in their mental attention.	1
Only insofar as they lead to the dissociation of the body etc.	1
The dissociation of the body etc.	1
refers to the nirvana without a remaining substratum and the relinquish- ment of moral defilement which has it (i.e.	1
the body) for its objective support.	0
The bodhisattvas do not [cultivate the latter] for the purpose of dissociation, nor for non-dissociation.	1
What is the reason?	1
For, those who are absolutely dissociated or not dissociated from the body etc.	1
would not have the capacity to	1

extinguished [i.e.	1
who are absolutely dissociated] and ordinary beings [i.e.	0
who are absolutely non-dissociated].	0
If it leads neither to dissociation nor non-dissociation ¹53, why then do they cultivate¹54 the counteragents?	1
Hence he says: [they cultivate them] on account of the fact that they lead to the attainment of the nirväpa in which one is not permanently fixed 155.	1
What is this nirvana [in which the bodhisattva is] not permanently fixed?	1
While [the aspirant] is in the bodhisattva state since it is the basis for mastery over karma and rebirth - although he is reborn in samsära on account of his compassion, he is without defilement there owing to the strength of his wisdom.	1
This is called 156 the unfixed nirvana of the the bodhisattva.	1
Although he is stationed in samsāra, he is not defiled like ordinary people are, nor does he [attain] the nirvana devoid of substratum 157, like the śrävakas etc.	1
Moreover, in the tathāgata state he is not permanently fixed in samsåra because he has relinquished the obscuration that consists in both moral defilement and the cognizable.	1
Nor is he permanently fixed in the nirvana devoid of a remaining substratum because there is no interruption to the Dharma Body, for, as long as the world exists, he per- forms benefit for others through the Enjoyment and Transformation Bodies.	1
In this way a distinction is made between the bodhisattva and the śrävaka etc.	1
concerning the meditative development of the counteragent according to differences in objective support, mental attention and result.	1
The meditative development of the counteragent has now been described.	1

stationed on a spiritual lineage.	1
(b) The arrival state pertains to one whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated.	1
(c) The prepara- tory state is subsequent to the generation of the resolve when the result has not been attained.	1
(d) The state of result [occurs when the latter] has been attained.	1
(e) The state with duties to be performed pertains to one who is still in training.	1
(f) The state without duties to be per- formed pertains to the adept.	1
(g) The state of excellence pertains to one endowed with the special qualities of the higher knowledges etc.	1
(h) The superior state pertains to the bodhisattva who has entered the spiri- tual levels above the śrävaka etc.	1
(i) The unsurpassable state pertains to the Buddha because there is no state that is superior to that.	1
(a) The state of firm conviction pertains to the bodhisattvas on all the spiritual levels consisting in the course of firm conviction.	1
(b) The state of entry [pertains to those] on the first spiritual level.	1
(c) The	1
(d) The prophetic state, on the eighth spiritual level.	1
(e) The state of teacher, on the ninth.	1
(f) The state of consecration, on the tenth.	1
(g) The attainment state refers to the Dharma Body of the Buddhas.	1
(h) The state of benefit refers to the Enjoyment Body.	1
(i) The state of the performance of duty refers to the Transformation Body.N57 Y188.2 Moreover, all of these various states, in short, should be known	1
dhätu: (a) impure, (b) impure and pure and (c) purified, as is appro- priate.	0
IV.15 bed Of these, (a) the impure state is inclusive of the causal state, up until the preparatory.	1
(b) The state that is both impure and pure pertains to those still in training.	1
(c) The purified state pertains to the adepts.	1
Hence is the respective establishment of individuals considered, as is fitting; Hence, from the differentiation of their states, as is fitting, the establishment of individuals should be known in this way: "this [person] is stationed in a spiritual lineage; that [person] has arrived"	1
[Sthiramati] [1] The state therein is described immediately following the meditative develop- ment of the counteragent, hence he asks: which are 158 the states in regard to the latter?	1
The words "in regard to the latter", signify: in regard to that meditative devel- opment of the counteragent; hence he says: IV.13 a (a) The causal state, (b) that called 'arrival' etc.	1
Of these, (a) the causal state is that which pertains to an individual stationed in a spiritual lineage.	1
What is meant is: the spiritual lineage is the cause, i.e.	1
the 'seed'.	1
In this respect, one who abides in a spiritual lineage, but not among those whose resolve has been generated, is the person who is meant in this context as being stationed in a spiritual lineage; furthermore, such a one enters into the higher states and does not turn back.	1
Some [schools] claim that the spiritual lineage has the root of the wholesome for its essential nature because certain roots of the wholesome are said to consist in the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka and so forth, up until certain others are said to consist in the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva.	1
Others again believe that, with reference to the state of the ordinary person159, the differentia- tion of the faculties is said to consist in the spiritual lineage and they claim that the spiritual lineage refers to a capacity of the 'seed' of mind.	1
When this exists, then, in the	1
Ms.(59a.5): prgjanya- which has been correctly amended to prthagjana- by Y; cf.	0
his fn.2 p.188.Y189	0
as the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka and so forth up until its description as the spiri- tual lineage of the bodhisattva.	1
However, one who is in the state of the adept is described as a śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha or a Buddha161 and there is no spiritual lineage on his part because of his pre-eminent state.	1
Moreover, that [i.e.	1
the spiritual lineage] is differentiated as threefold according to one's differentiation as śrāvaka etc.	1
and is sixfold according to its differentiation as determinate and indeterminate 162.	0
[2] (b) The arrival state pertains to one whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated.	1
Such a person can be one of three types belonging respec- tively to either the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha or the tathāgata because he generates the resolve for the enlightenment 163 of either the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha or the Perfectly Enlightened One.	1
Since he arrives in the preparatory [state] when the latter has originated, because it consists in the roots of preparation, its generation is described as the state of arrival in preparation.	1
(c) The preparatory state is subsequent to the generation of the resolve, when the result has not been attained.	1
It is described as preparatory since, for one whose resolve for enlightenment164 has been generated, it is the expedient which causes the attainment of the first result by practising the wholesome roots 165, beginning with generosity and morality and terminating in the meditative development of the powers.	1
Why are the causal and arrival states described as the states that comprise the meditative develop- ment of the factors that contribute to enlightenment?	1
Because they are causes of the latter.	1
Only because of this is it said that the generation of the resolve due to the spiri- tual lineage has ever increasing results etc.166.	1
(d) The state of result [occurs when the latter] has been attained; i.e.	1
when the first result [has been attained] for preparation is undertaken for the sake of the result; hence, the state of result follows immediately after the preparatory [state].	1
(e) The state with duties to be per- formed pertains to one still in training167 because he has not completely attained the results since there are duties still to be performed for the attainment of the other results 168.	1

the three realms of existence.	1
It is the state without duties to be performed because such a one has completely attained the results since there are no duties still to be per- formed for the attainment of the other results.	1
(g) The state of excellence pertains to one endowed with the special qualities of the higher knowl- edges etc.	1
When there is the state of an arhat, one is endowed with the special quali- ties such as the higher knowledges, [therefore], the state of the perfection of the special qualities of the higher knowledges etc.	1
is distinguished from other [states] and is described as the state of excellence.	1
(h) The superior state pertains to the bodhisattva who has entered the spiritual levels above the śrävaka and	1
penetrates 170 both the insubstantialities and is occupied with benefit for oneself and others, the state of the latter is described as the superior state because it is superior to other vehicles.	1
(i) The unsurpassable state pertains to the Buddha.	1
What is the reason?171 He says: ...because there is no state subsequent to that.	1
It pertains to the Buddha [state] because this is the final basis 172 for the excellence and absence of all virtues and faults [respectively].	1
It is described as unsurpassable because another state of excellence subsequent to this cannot be found.	1
[3] Although [the explanation of the states in their entirety is complete because of what has been discussed so far, in order to demonstrate the differentiation of the eleven spiritual levels of the bodhisattva, the states beginning with the course of 173 firm con- viction and terminating in the state of consecration etc.	1
174, are now described.	1
How- ever, in order to demonstrate the differentiation of the three Buddha Bodies, the three	1
arrival states are to be known as being common to both bodhisattvas and others 175.	1
(a) The state of firm conviction pertains to the bodhisattvas on all the spiritual levels that consists in the course of firm conviction.	1
In this regard, subsequent to the generation of the resolve [for enlightenment] and before his entry to the spiritual levels, although [the aspirant] has not perceived reality, it is as though he has perceived reality, [for] he comprehends the dharmas by way of the three natures on account of his firm conviction in the Buddhas and the bodhisattvas.	1
He is intent upon the resources for the achievement of Buddhahood, i.e.	1
generosity and morality etc., which are difficult to perform for other sentient beings, thus this is	1

firm resolve.	1
Moreover, this 176 [continues] for countless aeons or more.	0
(b) The state of entry [pertains to the bodhisattva] on the first spiritual level; it is described as the state of entry because, from the very beginning, through the direct intuition of the three natures that is devoid of conceptual differentiation he has the intuitive knowledge and penetration of reality.	1
This same [level] is the path of vision of the bodhisattva.	1
(c) The state of setting forth, on the six spiritual levels subsequent to the latter; these spiritual levels are described¹77 as the state of	1
notional attachment to the multiplicity of signs (nimitta) which is to be relinquished through meditative development and (b) reaches the end of preparation that is accom- panied by deliberate effort178.	1
(d) The prophetic state, on the eighth¹7 spiritual level; due to the absence of deliberate effort 130 and conceptualization in regard to all signs in every respect on the eighth level, it is prophesized through an open prophecy by the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, that Buddhahood is certain.	1
(e) The state of teacher¹81, on the ninth; on the ninth level he obtains the four analytical knowledges which are distinctly superior to [those of the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas and becomes an unsurpassable teacher of the universal Dharma.	1
(f) The state of consecration, on the tenth spiritual level182; for, on the tenth level the bodhisattva has reached the end of the path and is consecrated by anointment with rays of light from the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, who are stationed in the world spheres of the ten directions.	1
(g) The attainment state refers to the Dharma Body of the Buddhas.	1
It is the Dharma Body of the Buddhas since it: (a) has the nature of the turning about of the basis, (b) has control over all dharmas and (c) is without a foundation these are due to both the relinquishment of all obscuration and the accumulation of the 'seeds' of all dharmas that are without impurity and which act as counteragent to those [obscurations].	1
It is described as the attainment state because by means of this [body the bodhisattva] reaches the culminating point in his penetration of the dharmas.	1
However, others claim that the extremely pure dharma- dhātu is [equivalent to] the Dharma Body which is the Body of real nature (dharmatākāya)183 because of the removal of adventitious stain in its entirety.	0

(h) The state of benefit refers to the Enjoyment body.	1
The Essential Nature [Body] is the body established in which he becomes perfectly enlightened 185.	0
The Enjoyment Body is that body on account of which one experiences the Recitation of the Dharma in the circle of assembly 186 together with the bodhisattvas who have reached their final end.	1
(i) The state of the performance of duty refers to the Transformation Body ¹87.	1
The Transformation Body is that which: (a) has the Essential Nature Body for a basis, (b) takes heed of the aspirations of sentient beings and (c) has infinite divisions in regard to the engagement in undertakings188 for the sake of those to be trained.	1
IV.15 b Threefold in relation to the dharma- thăm etc.	1
As to how this can be, he says:	0
(a) impure, (b) impure and pure and (c) purified, as is appropriate.	1
189 Of these, (a) the impure state is inclusive of the causal state up until 190 the preparatory; i.e.	1
the states of cause, arrival, preparation and firm conviction are included.	1
In relation to these states, the impure state is so-called because the stain of the dharmadhatu has not been relinquished in its entirety.	1
(b) The state that is both impure and pure pertains to those who are still in training; and in this context, the states of result, that with duties still to be performed 191, distinction, superiority, entry, setting forth, prophecy, teacher and consecration are included.	1
Moreover, in relation to these states, the state that is both impure and pure is so-called because the moral defilement of the dharmadhātu is both relinquished and not relin- quished.	1
(c) The purified state pertains to the adepts; i.e.	1
the states without duties still to be performed, distinction, superiority, attainment, benef and the perfor- mance of duty are described as the purified state because the adepts have relinquished moral defilement in its entirety.	1

IV.16 cd The results respectively are: (a) the fit vessel known as the karma-result, (b) strength because of the influence of the latter, (c) inclination, (d) growth and (e) purification.	1
(a) The fit vessel refers to the karma-result that conforms with the wholesome.	1

(c) Inclination refers to the inclination towards the wholesome that is due to previous practice.	1
(d) Growth refers to the nourishment of the root of the wholesome which is due to practice in regard to the wholesome dharmas in the present.	1
(e) Purification refers to the relinquishment of obscura- tion.	1
These fivefold results are to be known respectively as: (a) the karma-result, (b) the influenced result, (c) the result as natural outcome, (d) the result of human effort and (e) the result of dissociation.	1
IV.17 cd & 18 abcd The other results are, in brief: (a) the ever increasing, (b) the first, (c) due to the practice of the latter, (d) due to completion, (e) due to conformity, (f) due to adverse elements, (g) due to dissociation, (h) due to excel- lence, (i) due to superiority and (j) due to unsurpassability.	0
(a) The ever increasing result is to be understood as a successive development, i.e.	1
the generation of the resolve is due to the spiritual lineage, and so on.	1
(b) The first result refers to the acquisition, from the very beginning, of the supramundane dharmas.	1
(c) The result of practice follows after the latter in the state of one still in training.	1
(d) The completion result refers to the qualities of the adept.	1
(e) The con- forming result is to be known as the ever increasing result in its causal mode.	1
(f) The result of the adverse elements is [equivalent to the path of relinquishment and is [to be known as the first result; [the adverseN58 elements are intended as counteragent¹94.	1
(g) The dissociation-result, i.e.	1
the direct realization of cessation195, consists in both the result of practice and completion result and refers to the dissociation from moral defilement on the part of one still in training and the adept, respec- tively.	1
(h) The excellent result refers to the special qualities such as the higher knowledges.	1
(i) The superior result refers to the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva because these are superior to the other vehicles.	1
(j) The unsurpassable result refers to the spiritual level of the Buddhas.	1
The latter four are divisions of the above-mentioned practice and com- pletion results.	1
The other results are [explained] by way of a condensed explanation but in full detail they are immeasurable.	1
[Sthiramati] Y192.19 [1] Since the state precedes the result, in order to comment on the result immediately after the states, he asks: which are the results that are attained?	1
Hence he says: IV.16 c ...(a) The fit vessel known as the karma-result etc.	0
In brief, the result is fivefold: (a) the fit vessel, (b) strength, (c) inclination, (d) growth and (e) purification.	1
Of these, (a) the fit vessel refers to the karma-result that conforms with the wholesome.	1
Now, that which consists in: (a) the relinquish- ment of the eight inopportune births, (b) the six sense-fields distinguished as impure and (c) the karma-result of the dharmas that contribute to enlightenment, is described as the fit vessel because it is the basis for the production of all wholesome dharmas.	1
(b) Strength which is [equivalent to a preponderance of the root196 of the	1
the fit vessel; i.e.	1
it is on account of the feeble production of moral defilement on the	1
nation198 refers to the inclination towards the wholesome which is due to previous practice 199.	1
Due to the practice of the wholesome dharmas in previous lives, there is a tendency towards [the practice of] wholesome dharmas in the present life, according to the analogy of a river and its currents 200 - this is inclination.	0
(d) Growth refers to the nourishment of the root of the wholesome201 - thus 194 pratipakso 'bhipretaḥ, but Tib.	0

consist in the root202 of the wholesome in the present203, i.e.	1
the production of excellent wholesome dharmas that were non-existent in the past.	1
This is the differ- ence between strength and growth, for strength consists in firmness in regard to the karma-result of the feeble wholesome [dharmas]204.	1
Whereas, growth refers to the ever increasing excellence in wholesome (dharmas].	1
Others again believe that in this context, the statement: "the nourishment of the root of the wholesome", is intended to signify the nourishment of the latent impressions of the excellent wholesome dharmas.	1
(e) Purification refers to the relinquishment of obscuration.	1
For those who belong to the spiritual lineages of the śrävaka and the pratyeka buddha, purifica-	1
defilement; but for those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva205, purification refers to the relinquishment of both the obscuration that consists moral defilement as well as the cognizable.	1
[2] These fivefold results are [to be known] respectively as: (i) the karma-result; i.e.	1
the karma-result that is conformable with the wholesome dharmas.	1
(ii) The influenced result; i.e.	1
the preponderance of wholesome [dharmas] that is due to the influence of the fit vessel.	1
(iii) The result as natural outcome; i.e.	1
the inclination towards the wholesome that is due to previous practice.	1
(iv) The result of human effort; i.e.	1
the nourishment of the root of the wholesome that is due to the practice of the wholesome dharmas in the present.	1
(v) The result of dissociation; i.e.	1
the relinquishment of obscuration.	1
[3] The division of these fivefold results that have been mentioned briefly, is now explained in brief: IV.17 C [The other results are, in brief]: (a) the ever increasing, (b) the first 206 (a) The ever increasing result is to be known as a successive develop- ment of the states as described above, i.e.	1
the generation of the resolve is due to the spiritual lineage, the preparatory [state] is due to the generation of the	1
very beginning, of the supramundane dharmas; i.e.	1
the attainment of the path of vision.	1
(c) The result of practice follows after the latter in the state of	1

non-returner in the state of one who is still in training which is comprised of the five individuals and is subsequent to the path of vision.	1
It is the result of practice because it consists in the path of meditative development which is subsequent to that [state] accompanied by preparation.	1
(d) The completion result refers to the qualities of the adept.	1
Now, these are called: correct view, correct intention, correct speech, correct action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness, correct meditative concentration as well as liberation and insight into the direct intuition that constitutes liberation.	1
It is described as the completion result because it is situated at the end of all the results.	1
(e) The conforming result is to be known as the ever increas- ing result in its causal mode.	1
The causal mode (upanișadbhāva) is [equivalent to] the cause (hetu)208; i.e.	0
because the generation of the resolve therein conforms with the spiritual lineage, the generation of the resolve is [the conforming] result209.	1
It should be known that there are separate respective teachings, by way of statement and explanation, for the ever increasing result etc.	1
and the conforming result etc.	1
(f) The result of the adverse elements is [equivalent to the path of relinquish- ment and is [to be known as] the first result210; because the adverse elements themselves are the result, this is [described as] the result of the adverse elements on account of which the path of relinquishment becomes dissociated from moral defile- ment.	1
The first result is that which was mentioned previously as: "the acquisition, from the beginning, of the supramundane dharmas".	1
Although the term "adverse element" (vipakşa) is [often] described as an obscuration in the sense that it is a hindrance to the counteragent, in this context, the adverse elements are intended as the counteragent211, for the word can be analysed in this way: the adverse	1
dissociation-result consists in both the result of practice and comple- tion-result and refers to the dissociation from moral defilement on the part of one still in training and the adept, respectively.	1
Dissociation as the result of practice pertains to the five still in training, beginning with the once-returner's entry into the result, because they possess residual moral defilement213.	1

The above [results] have been described by way of their differentiation, now the excellent [result is described] since it is not differentiated: (h) the excellent result refers to the special qualities such as the higher knowledges216.	1
This should be understood just as the excel- lence of the practice and completion results217.	0
What is the reason?	1
Because [Vasubandhu] has in mind the acquisition of the special qualities on the part of the non-returners, the arhats, the pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattvas, and the tathāgatas.	0
(i) The superior result refers to the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva218; here he provides the reason: because these are superior to the other vehicles 219.	1
Even though the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva consist in both the first result and the result of practice, because these have the natures of the paths of vision and meditative development, nevertheless, in relation to the śrävaka and pratyeka- buddha vehicles, the superior result is to be known to pertain to the spiritual levels 220 of the bodhisattva because: (a) it is devoid of conceptual differentiation, (b) it belongs to the spiritual lineage of the Buddhas and (c) it is the result of universal enlighten- ment 221. j) The unsurpassable result refers to the spiritual level of the Buddhas.	1
This consists only in the completion result since it is due to the relin- quishment of all moral defilement and secondary defilement together with their latent impressions, and is also due to the relinquishment of undefiled nescience.	1
It is described as the unsurpassable result because there is no other spiritual level222 that is superior to it.	1
[4] The other results are [explained] by way of a condensed explana- tion, however in full detail they are immeasurable223.	1
In full detail, the results that are set forth pertinent to the śrävakas, the pratyekabuddhas, the bodhi- sattvas and the Perfectly Enlightened Ones are immeasurable.	1

[3] The summary meaning of the result consists in those that are due to: (a) the aggregation, (b) the distinction of the latter, (c) previous practice, (d) ever increasing accomplishment, (e) statements and (f) explanations.	1
The author of the commentary himself provides an exposition of these of these, (a) that which is due to aggregation refers to the five results; i.e.	1
those beginning with the karma-result since all the results are included in these.	1
(b) That which is due to the distinction of the latter refers to the remaining [results]; i.e.	1
the differentiation of those same five.	1
The remaining [results] should be known as those beginning with the ever increasing result.	1
(c) That which is due to previous practice refers to the karma-result; i.e.	1
the karma-result in the present life which is due to the accumulation of wholesome [dharmas] in past lives.	1
Since it arises in conformity with the wholesome, it is described as being due to previous practice.	1
(d) That which is due to ever increasing accomplishment refers to the other four; i.e.	1
the influenced result, the result as natural outcome, the result of human effort and the result of dissociation.	1
In relation to these, strength refers to what is accomplished through the karma-result; inclination refers to what is accomplished through strength; growth refers to what is accomplished through inclination; purification refers to what is accomplished through growth.	1
Some believe it is described as an ever increasing accomplishment because it is characterized by successive expositions.	1
(e) That which is due to statements refers to the four beginning with the ever increasing result; i.e.	1
the ever increasing result, the first result, the result of practice and the completion-result.	1

D287a.4.Chapter Five The Supremacy of the VehicleN60.3 1.	0
The Three Kinds of Supremacy.	1
V.1 abc Supremacy is considered as listed in relation to: (a) spiritual practice, (b) objective support and (c) full attain- ment.	0
The threefold supremacies which are [incorporated] in the universal vehicle and on account of which it is the supreme vehicle are: (a) supremacy of spiritual practice, (b) supremacy of objective support and (c) supremacy of full attainment.	1
[2] Alternatively, the Meditative Development of the Counteragent, the State Therein and the Attainment of the Result were explained as common to both the śrävaka etc.	1
and the bodhisattva; however, because they do not share the same states³, the supremacy of the vehicle is not common to both the bodhisattva and the śrāvaka etc.	1
And in order to demonstrate that it is described as the chief object in this context, he says: "the supremacy of the vehicle should now be mentioned it is said:...".	1
Since there is nothing higher than this, the word 'supremacy' is a synonym for 'excellence'.	1
But what is this?	1
It is the universal vehicle, for thus, inasmuch as the universal vehicle is superior to both the śrävaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles, there is none other that is more excellent compared with the universal vehicle because of the proportional differ- ences in cause and result in regard to it.	1
Supremacy (ānuttarya) refers to the state (bhava) of that which is supreme (anuttarasya); but just what is this?	1
Hence he says: [Sthiramati] [1] The supremacy of the vehicle was [initially] listed immediately after the listing of the six subjects, such as the Characteristics and the Obscurations2; hence, subsequent to the explanation of these, the subject under discussion is the explanation of the Supremacy of the Vehicle.	1
Consequently, he says: the supremacy of the vehicle	1
"immediately following the explanation of the six [subjects] such as the Characteristic".	1
The intended meaning is: because it was listed immediately after those [subjects].	1

ated elements, the accumulations, application, subsequently attained direct intuition, the special qualities, objective support and result.	1
Of these, the objective support refers to thusness; the result refers to the nirvāṇa in which the bodhisattva is not permanently fixed.	1
And the universal vehicle refers to the teachings such as the Sütras which are expressive of this universal vehicle.	1
Moreover, the [name of the] text is applied figur- atively for its subject matter, just as the "Slaying of Kamsa" is [figuratively used] for	1
vehicle...5 But what is this universal vehicle?	1
Just these three: (a) spiritual prac- tice, (b) objective support and (c) full attainment.	1
Of these, (a) the supremacy of spiritual practice refers to the accomplishment of the ten perfections, i.e.	1
the spiritual practice of the bodhisattva is described as supreme in regard to the accom- plishment of the perfections.	1
(b) Moreover, the objective support refers to the dharmas of the perfections etc.	1
and to the dharmadhâtu.	1
By means of this objective support, the bodhisattvas have the capacity to provide benefit without remainder for others6; hence, the supremacy of objective support refers to its being the cause of the capacity to pro- vide benefit for others.	1
Why?	1
This the objective support of the bodhisattvas is described as supreme because it belongs to him.	1
(c) Full attainment refers to the result of: (i) the spiritual lineage, (ii) firm conviction and (iii) the generation of the resolve	1
[samudāgacchanti] or attains this due to the spiritual lineage etc., it is [described as] full attainment (samudāgama]; and it is described as supreme because there is no other full attainment superior to this.	1
Consequently, in this context, supremacy refers to the absence of anything other that is superior to that full attainment.	1
And in this respect, it is said that the spiritual practice of the bodhisattvas, together with its foundation and results, consists in the universal vehicle.	1
Moreover, it is described as supreme on account of the threefold supremacy that has just been described.	1

It is universal (mahat) because it possesses the seven kinds of universality; it is a vehicle (yāna) since [the bodhisattva) reaches the unfixed nirvāṇa travelling (yanti) by means of it.	1
Since it is both a vehicle and is universal, it is the universal vehicle 10.	1
Furthermore, its sevenfold universality refers to universality in regard to: (a) objective support, (b) spiritual practice, (c) direct intuition, (d) vigour, (e) expedients, (f) attainment and (g) action.	1
Of these, (a) the universality in regard to objective support refers to the Dharma of the endless Sutras, such as the Hundred Thousand [Prajñāpāramitā], for these form the objective support for the path of the bodhisattva.	1
(b) The universality in regard to spiritual practice is the result of spiritual practice concerned with benefit in its entirety for both oneself and others.	1
(c) The	1
regard to the personal entity and the dharmas.	1
(d) The universality in regard to vigour is due to application in regard to the many hundreds of thousands of difficult tasks [to be performed] over three countless aeons.	1
(e) The universality in regard to skill in	1
nirvāņa.	0
(f) The universality in regard to attainment is due to the understanding of the immeasurable and countless virtues, such as the powers, self-confidence and the special Buddha qualities.	1
(g) The universality in regard to actions is due to the perfor- mance of the acts of the Buddha by revealing his enlightenment for as long as samsāra exists.	1
Only this universal vehicle is supreme; the state of the latter is [described as] supremacy because there is no vehicle that is superior to it.	1
Furthermore, it consists in spiritual practice, objective support and full attainment, for thus, the universal vehicle is described as supreme because it possesses these [three] elements.	1
There is supremacy of spiritual practice since spiritual practice supreme; the supremacy of objective support and the supremacy of full attainment should be understood in the same way.	1
These supremacies are respectively determined with reference to: (a) the path of the bodhisattva, (b) its support and (c) the result of that [path].	1
Moreover, it is just these that are referred to through the statements of the Buddha, viz.	1
: spiritual prac- tice, objective support and the result of that (practice).	1
It difficult to establish the full significance of this analagy; perhaps it refers to the appropriation of Kamsa's wealth etc.	1

spiritual practice, (b) spiritual practice in regard to mental attention, (c) spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma, (d) spiritual practice that avoids the two extremes, (e) specific spiritual practice and (f) non- specific spiritual practice.	1
[Sthiramati] Y201.12 [1] Although it is fitting that the objective support be explained firstly because spiritual practice is preceded by the objective support, spiritual practice is mentioned initially in order to demonstrate that it is the essence of the practice of the bodhisattvas.	0
Of these, how is the supremacy of spiritual practice [to be known]?	1
Hence he says: the supremacy of spiritual practice is to be known by way of the practice of the ten perfections.	1
The spiritual practice of the perfections is [equivalent to] the performance of the perfections; and since this spiritual practice of the perfections is explained only in the universal vehicle and not in any other vehicle¹2, he shows the universal vehicle to be supreme.	1
Moreover, this spiritual practice becomes supreme	1
and in order to illustrate these modes, he says: V.1 d Spiritual practice is sixfold: It is not known as to how this spiritual practice of the perfections [is sixfold], begin- ning with the highest up until the non-specific, hence he says:	0

The Highest Spiritual Practice.	1
The highest consists in twelve: (a) Magnanimity, (b) duration, (c) prerogative, (d) inexhaustibility, (e) continuity, (f) non-hardship, (g) wealth and (h) possession; (i) Enterprise, (j) acquisition, (k) natural outcome and (1) accom- plishment these are considered as highest.	1
These twelve types are considered as highest, namely: (a) the highest degree of magnanimity, (b) the highest degree of duration, (c) the high- est degree of prerogative, (d) the highest degree of inexhaustibility, (e) the highest degree of continuity, (f) the highest degree of non-hardship, (g) the highest degree of wealth, (h) the highest degree of possession, (i) the highest degree of enterprise, (j) the highest degree of acquisi- tion, (k) the highest degree of natural outcome and (1) the highest degree of accomplishment.	1

(c) The highest degree of prerogative is due to the prerogative for deeds of benefit for all beings.	1
(d) The highest degree of inexhaustibility is due to the complete absence of exhaustion on account of the transformation into universal enlighten- ment.	1
(e) The highest degree of continuity is due to a firm conviction in the sameness of self and others due to the fulfilment of the perfec- tions of generosity etc.	1
in regard to all beings.	1
(f) The highest degree of non-hardship is due to the fulfilment of the perfections of generosity etc.	1
on the part of others, through his approval alone.	1
(g) The highest degree of wealth is due to the fulfilment of generosity etc.	1
by means of the "treasury of the sky" meditative concentration etc.	1
(h) The highest degree of possession is due to the possession [by the bodhisattva] of	1
highest degree of enterprise refers to the abundant measure of patience on the spiritual level of the one who courses in firm conviction.	1
(j) The№62 highest degree of acquisition refers to the first spiritual level.	1
(k) The highest degree of natural outcome refers to the eight spiritual levels subsequent to the latter.	1
(1) The highest degree of accomplishment refers to the tenth spiritual level and to that of the tathāgata since these are the [respective] accomplishments of (a) the bodhisattva and (b) the Buddhas.	1

maturity.	1
These are the respective actions that pertain to the latter [i.e.	1
to the perfections] for, (a) through his generosity, the bodhisattva assists beings.	1
(b) On account of his morality, he does not injure others.	1
(c) Through patience, he endures the injury inflicted by others.	1
(d) Through vigour, he increases his virtues.	1
(e) Through the meditative absorptions, he initiates beings, having attracted them by means of his psychic power etc.	1
(f) Through his wisdom, he liberates them by providing correct counsel.	1
(g) Through the perfection of skill in expe-	1
transformation into universal enlightenment.	1
(h) Through the perfection of vows, he engages in generosity etc.	1
at all times while rejoicing in the birth of a Buddha in all his lives due to his possession of favourable rebirths.	1
(i) Through the perfection of strength, he engages eternally in generosity etc.	1
due to the strength of his critical consideration and meditative development because he is not overcome by adverse ele- ments.	1
(j) Through the perfection of direct intuition, since it removes confusion about the literal meaning of the Dharma, he experiences in return the enjoyment of the Dharma which has generosity etc.	1
[Sthiramati] Y201.12 [1] Of these: V.2 d The highest consists in twelve: What is meant is: the highest [spiritual practice] which is vast and unsurpassable has twelve modes in order to demonstrate these modes, he says: V.3 a (a) Magnanimity, (b) duration etc.	0
From the highest degree of magnanimity up until the highest degree of accomplishment; these twelve types are considered as highest ¹4.	1
Of these, the highest degree of magnanimity is to be known as not seeking after¹5 all mundane16 success and also as pre-eminence.	1
Success is [equivalent to] prosperity; and this has two aspects: (a) that which is attained and (b) that not attained.	1
Of these, [the bodhisattva] does not become attached to what is attained nor does he strive for what is not attained because he applies himself to the removal of the suffering of others without regard for his own happiness.	1
As has been stated: O virtuous one, what fruit of merit you have; all that is for the benefit of others, not for your own sake¹7.	1
It is [also described as] pre-eminence18 because its fruit is Buddhahood which is	1

person is generally described as being of two sorts: (a) munificent and (b) devoid of the desire for services in return.	1
Therefore, the bodhisattva does not strive for all mun- dane success ¹9 but applies himself to the perfections, such as generosity, which are ever increasing.	1
This is what is described as the magnanimity of spiritual practice.	1
[2] The highest degree of duration...; its pre-eminence is on account of its duration.	1
Moreover, duration refers to the extended practice of the perfections begin- ning with generosity.	1
And since it is not known as to how long this endures, he says:	1
For, the bodhisattvas' meditative development of the perfections, such as generosity, is of exceeding duration because it is completed over three countless aeons.	1
[3] The highest degree of prerogative20 is due to the prerogative for deeds of benefit for all beings21.	1
It is described as the highest by way of pre- rogative22 (adhikārataḥ) since the bodhisattvas engage in generosity etc.	1
without regard for their own happiness for the sake of (adhikṛtya) bringing about welfare and happiness for all beings.	1
[4] The highest degree of inexhaustibility 23...; it is of the highest degree on account of the fact that it is inexhaustible; but what is its inexhaustibility due to?	1
Hence	1
transformation into universal enlightenment24.	0
Even after yielding the karma-	1
transformation into universal enlightenment, are not completely severed.	1
Even in the nirväņa devoid of the remnants of existence they are not exhausted due to: (a) the pro- duction of the Dharma Body which is characterized by the turning about of the basis and (b) the inexhaustibility of that [Dharma Body].	1
However, they are severed in the nirvāṇa realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence through the transformation into enlightenment of the śrävaka etc.	1

is not inexhaustible in this way.	1
Or else, for the bodhisattvas, the roots of the wholesome that are transformed into universal enlightenment for the benefit of	1
beings, they are not completely exhausted.	1
[6] The highest degree of continuity is due to a firm conviction in the sameness of self and others due to the fulfilment of the perfections of generosity etc.	1
in regard to all beings26.	0
For, on the Joyous spiritual level, the bodhisattva becomes firmly convinced of the sameness of self and others because of his awareness of the all-pervading meaning 27 of the dharmadhātu.	1
Having relin- quished conceptual differentiation in regard to self and others due to his firm convic- tion in the sameness of self and others he obtains an extremely joyous mind on account of others' generosity etc., just as he does on account of his own generosity etc.	1
As the consequence this the perfections, such as generosity, are continually fulfilled every instant, every moment and every day.	1
[7] The highest degree of non-hardship is due to the fulfillment of the perfection of generosity etc.	1
on the part of others, through his approval alone.	1
The bodhisattvas with joyous mind express their approval of the roots of the wholesome, such as the generosity of beings, in such a way that the perfections, such as generosity, of those [beings] is fulfilled through that approval alone.	1
[8] The highest degree of wealth is due to the fulfillment of generosity	1
The bodhisattvas obtain the meditative concentration called 'treasury of the sky' through meditative development which penetrates the dharmadhātu.	1
From obtaining this, they cause the fulfillment of the perfection of generosity because they are then able to fulfill all the aspirations of sentient beings.	1
For, under the influence of this, the very sky (gagana) becomes a treasury (gañja) - thus it is designated as the 'treasury of the sky' (gagana-ganja) meditative concentration.	1
Alternatively, a treasury (gańja) is established in the sky (gagana)28 because all of the necessities of life are produced from the sky through the power of this meditative concentration29.	1
By the word "etc."	1
the meditative concentrations that are taught in the Sutras of the Prajñāpäramitãs etc.	1
are referred to.	1
[9] The highest degree of possession is due to the possession [by the bodhisattva] of direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differenti- ation.	1
For the bodhisattvas' direct intuition is devoid of conceptual differentiation³0 Read: sarvasattvadānādibhiḥ päramitāparipūraṇād in place of sarvasattveșu dănădipăramitāpari- pūraṇād; cf.	0

patience on the spiritual level of the one who courses in firm convic- tion.	1
The first immeasurable aeon is described as the level of the one who courses in	1
is, in those whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated, a totally firm convic- tion33 in the insubstantiality of the dharmas in terms of the three natures this consists in an abundant measure of patience which is not overpowered by adverse elements such as lack of faith34.	1
For this is the state of enterprise of the bodhisattva, and as a consequence, his patience in abundant measure is described as the highest degree of enterprise.	1
Similarly, their direct intuition is devoid of conceptual differentiation due to their non- perception of [the three modes of the other nine perfections³2] up until the knower,	1
is encompassed by that highest direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.	1
How so?	1
Because it conforms with that [direct intuition] and because it has the latter	1
[11] The highest degree of acquisition refers to the first spiritual level.	1
For the supramundane perfections are obtained on the first spiritual level because of [the bodhisattvas] awareness of the all-pervading nature of 'the dharmadhātu.	1
How- since the mundane [perfections] were included previously by way of the prepara- tion for the first spiritual level, it is said that on the first spiritual level there is the high- est degree of acquisition.	1
[12] The highest degree of natural outcome refers to the eight [spiritual levels] subsequent to the latter.	1
Acquisition that is distinctively superior on the eight spiritual levels other than the latter [i.e.	1
the first] is the natural outcome of the per- fections acquired on the first spiritual level³5, thus it is the highest degree of natural outcome.	1
Alternatively, the highest degree of acquisition refers to the acquisition of the first spiritual level through the force of the meditative development of the perfections on the level of the one who courses in firm conviction.	1
A quotation from a Sūtra states: The first spiritual level is included in the path of vision of the bodhisattva and because of his entry into that, [the bodhisattva] is born in the spiritual	1
This obviously refers to a series, hence the ten perfections are suggested tentatively.	1

Or again, the highest degree of natural outcome refers to the eight spiritual levels [other than the first] because they are the natural outcome of the perfections that are acquired on the first level.	1
nature and are in conformity with it.37 [13] The highest degree of accomplishment refers to the tenth spiritual level and to that of the tathāgata 40 since these are the [respective] accomplishments of (a) the bodhisattvas and (b) the Buddhas.	1
(a) Since the bodhisattva reaches the end of all the bodhisattva courses on the tenth spiritual level, he is consecrated there41 as an incumbent (Buddha] by the tathāgatas.	1
There is the highest degree of accomplishment for the bodhisattvas on the tenth spiritual level42 because of: (i) the fulfilment of an inconceivable accumulation of merit and direct intuition; (ii) the absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to all dharmas and (iii) the production of benefit, in every respect, for oneself and others.	1
(b) But on the spiri- tual level of the tathāgatas43, since the Venerable One becomes the teacher of the whole world because he attains pre-eminence in relinquishment, direct intuition and might	1
this accomplishment?	1
It is the achievement of the qualities of the bodhisattva and of the qualities of the Buddha, in every respect.	1
[14] Alternatively, the culmination of the perfections that are included on the level of one still in training is [equivalent to] the tenth spiritual level; hence, there the full accomplishment of the bodhisattva on that [level].	1
The highest limit of [the perfec- tions] that are included on the level of the adept is (equivalent to the Buddha level.	0
Since training in the perfections is no longer present on that level, there is full accom- plishment as the full accomplishment of the Buddhas.	1
Thus, the highest degree of full accomplishment is to be known as: (a) the full accomplishment of the bodhisattvas on the tenth spiritual level and (b) the full accomplishment of the Buddha on the level of the tathāgata.	1

Since these 45 twelvefold [spiritual practices] exist in the highest degree within the latter [i.e.	1
in the perfections], such as in the generosity [practised by] the bodhisattva, but not in the generosity etc.	0
of the śrävaka, consequently, the ten perfections beginning with generosity and concluding with direct intuition which pertain just to the bodhisattva are considered in this sense, i.e.	1
as high- est according to the rules of etymology.	1
Thus it is just the spiritual practice that pertains to the ten46 perfections which is said to be of the highest degree.	1
V.4 cd [16] Of these [means] of these perfections, with regard to which, even their mere name has not been disclosed; in order to disclose their names, it is said: V.5 abcd (a) Generosity, (b) morality, (c) patience, (d) vigour, (e) meditative absorption, (f) wisdom47, (g) expedi- ency, (h) vows, (i) the powers and (j) direct intuition these are the ten perfections.	0
It was stated that "the highest degree of prerogative is due to the prerogative for deeds of benefit for all beings"48, hence the question is asked: which are the actions pertinent to each of these?	1
Therefore he says: V.6 ab Actions that: (a) are of assistance, (b) are non-violent, (c) endure such [violence] etc.	0
For, through generosity, the bodhisattva assists beings.	1
(a) In this regard, because he is irreproachable on account of his wish to honour and assist [beings], one who is indifferent to both the service49 in return for a favour and the karma-result	1
bestows [gifts on beings] through his acts of body and speech this is the material generosity of the bodhisattva.	1
By means of this he assists beings by taking away their sufferings of hunger and thirst etc.	1
(b) The instructions to do with modes of living, scriptural treatises, arts and crafts and [the practice of] non-violence towards beings, [instructions] which are preceded by compassion, as well as the instructions on propit- ious states of existence and the path to liberation, are the gifts of the Dharma.	1

(c) The gift of fearlessness consists of liberation for those who are attacked by kings 50, thieves, kinsmen or beasts of prey etc.	1
and thereby he assists beings by removing the fear of calamity to life, enjoyment, children and wife etc.	1
Morality refers to abstention from all misdeeds of body and speech, and, in keeping with worldly practice, abstention (from the acts of body and speech) which are forbid- den and the performance of the acts of body and speech that are prescribed.	1
Because	1
not injure or offend beings himself, nor does he cause others to do so.	1
[18] Through patience, he endures the injury inflicted 52 by others.	1
Patience consists in the endurance and toleration of all forms of suffering with a mind predominated by compassion.	1
On account of this (the bodhisattva] endures injury such as murder53, bondage or the beatings inflicted by others, because he has no wish to retaliate54.	1
[19] Through vigour, he increases his virtues.	1
Vigour is a strength of will with reference to generosity etc.	1

[23] Through the perfection of vows he engages in generosity etc.	1
at all times while rejoicing in the birth of a Buddha58 in all of his rebirths due to his possession of favourable births.	0
Because vows have the nature of all sorts of wishes 59, a vow in this context is considered as being the wish for a rebirth in keeping with one's wholesome [deeds].	1
The action pertinent to this is the engagement in generosity etc.	1
at all times while rejoicing in the birth of a Buddha in each of one's rebirths.	1
[24] Through the perfection of strength, he engages eternally in gen- erosity etc.	1
due to the strength 60 of his critical consideration and medi- tative development, because he is not overcome by adverse elements.	1
Critical consideration refers to wisdom; meditative development refers to the practice in [developing] the wholesome dharmas.	1
Both of these, which cannot be overcome by adverse elements, are described as the perfection of strength.	1
The action pertinent to this is the engagement in generosity etc.	1

This confusion in regard to literal meaning refers to that whereby one construes [the meaning] in just the literal sense after rejecting the intended meaning.	1
The Dharma, i.e.	1
the Sütras etc., which is taught with reference to generos- ity, i.e.	1
having made generosity the objective support, has generosity as its controlling influence,.	1
[The Dharma] should be considered in the same way [in regard to the other perfections] i.e.	1
as having morality, patience and vigour etc.	1
as controlling influ- ence.	0
The actions pertinent to the perfection of direct intuition are: (a) the experiencing of the enjoyment of the Dharma and (b) the maturation of beings, through: (a) analyti- cal discussion [of the Dharma]62 which is free from erroneous inversion concerning the universal vehicle on the part of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas63 and (b) the bring- ing of beings to maturity by means of the Dharma teachings that are free from erroneous inversion because the Dharma instructions, such as the Sutras, are consti- tuted by the perfection of direct intuition.	1

Moreover, this spiritual practice in regard to mental attention is to be known as being encompassed by the ten acts of the Dharma.	1
Which are these tenfold Dharmic acts?	1
V.9 abcd They are: (a) transcription, (b) ven- eration, (c) giving, (d) listening, (e) .reading, (f) receiving, (g) revealing, (h) recitation, (i) reflection and (j) meditative development.	0
(a) The transcription [of the works] of the universal vehicle, (b) its veneration, (c) providing others with it, (d) listening when it is being recited by another, (e) reading it oneself, (f) receiving it, (g) teaching the texts or their meaning to others, (h) recitation, (i) reflection and (j) meditative development.	1
V.10 ab For these tenfold acts entail an im- measurable collection of merit;	0
exorbitantly great result only in the universal vehicle, but not in the śrävaka vehicle?	0
For two reasons: V.10 c Because of their: (a) superiority and (b) inexhaustibility.	0
How can it be due to their: (a) superiority and (b) inexhaustibility?	1
V.10 d Because they: (a) assist others and (b) do not cease.286 They are superior because they are engaged in assisting others.	1
They are to be known as inexhaustible because they are not appeased, i.e.	1
do not cease, even in parinirvāpa.	1
Spiritual practice in relation to mental attention has now been described.	1
[Sthiramati] Y209.12 [1] The spiritual practice in relation to mental attention should be mentioned immedi- ately following the explanation of the highest spiritual practice; consequently, he asks: which is the spiritual practice in relation to mental attention?	0
Hence he says: V.7 ab [The bodhisattva's] mental attention, in the universal vehicle, to the Dharmas 65 as set out etc.	0
The mental attention to the Dharmas such as the Sütras as set out66 with reference to generosity etc., i.e.	1
with reference to67 generosity, morality, patience, vigour etc.	1
Herein, (the mental attention to] the Dharmas, such as the Sūtras, mixtures of prose and verse and also the prophesies taught by the Venerable One with reference to generosity in whatever mode, which are so devoid of superimposition and negation as to meaning and word, is the spiritual practice in regard to mental attention;	1
the latter, generosity etc.	1
68 is taught as being just for one's own benefit and not for the benefit of oneself as well as others, as in the universal vehicle.	1
Therefore, it is just in the universal vehicle that the mental attention by the bodhisattvas to the Dharmas, such as the Sūtras as set out with reference to generosity etc., is the spiritual practice in regard to mental attention.	1
It is made known that in the śrävaka vehicle the mental attention to the Sutras etc.	1
that are preached with reference to generosity etc.	1
is a false spiritual practice in regard to mental attention69 because it has just the benefit of the individual for its basis.	1
Moreover, for the most part, these [Dharmas of the universal vehicle] are taught with reference to evenmindedness, non-attachment, lack of arro- gance and non-perception.	1
Evenmindedness, in this respect, is the wish to assist equally both those who possess virtues and those who do not.	1
Non-attachment, in this respect, is the application in regard to generosity etc.	1
that is only for the benefit of others on the part of one who has no wish for existence and enjoyment.	1

Non-perception, in this respect, is the purification of the three aspects [of giving] according to the rule of the non-perception of the gift, the giver and the recipient.	1
Continuously, i.e.	1
again and again, through the wisdom that consists in: (a) learning, (b) reflection and (c) meditative development.	1
Of these, (a) that which consists in learning is the certainty that comes from the authori- tative statements of a trustworthy person.	1
(b) That which consists in reflection is [the certainty] that comes from reasoning and profound reflection.	1
(c) That which consists in meditative development is [the certainty] that comes from meditative development.	1
[2] Since all engagement is for the sake of the result, he asks: through these three modes of wisdom what virtue does that 70 mental attention bring71?	1
Hence he says: V.8 ab	0
[equivalent to] its augmentation.	1
And, on account of the nourishment of the constituent element, one becomes possessed of brilliant and extensive wisdom in the future.	1
[The bodhisattva] whole-heartedly enters into the meaning of what he has learnt.	1
Through the wisdom that consists in reflection, he resolutely enters into the true meaning 73 that is not erroneously inverted 74 because this is generated through the force of reasoning in respect of the meaning of those Dharmas such as the Sūtras that he has learnt.	1
Through [the wisdom] that consists in meditative develop- ment, he attains success in his aims.	1
The success in one's aims is [equivalent to] the understanding of reality.	1
How so?	1
He says: because [such wisdom] causes the purification for entry to the spiritual levels.	0
For, he enters the spiritual levels through the purifying [processes] of the applications of mindfulness etc.	1
Hence it is explained that he enters the spiritual levels only through the applications of mindfulness etc.	1
Consequently, he attains success in his aims due to the purifying [processes] that come from the wisdom that consists in the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness etc.	1
which constitute the entry to the spiritual levels.	1
What is meant is: he enters the spiritual levels.	1
It leads to: (a) the nourishment of the constituent element, (b) entry and	1

(213 V.10 ab For, these tenfold acts entail an im- measurable collection of merit85; The collection of merit that arises from each particular Dharmic act, i.e.	1
from the Dharmic acts that are said to be of ten types, cannot be measured either by oneself or by another because it is far too great.	1
Why is it, when [both vehicles] are equal as	1
absorptions etc., that in the Sütras, the acts of the Dharma are taught as having an exorbitantly great result only in the universal vehicle, but in the Sutras, the acts of the Dharma are not taught in the śrävaka vehicle as having a great result?	1
For two reasons are the acts of the Dharma taught as having an exorbitantly great result in the universal vehicle as to which are these two86, he says: V.10 c Because of their: (a) superiority and (b) inexhaustibility;	0
ority and (b) inexhaustibility?	1
Hence he says: V.10 d Because they: (a) assist others and (b) do not cease.	0
For, in the universal vehicle, the spiritual practice of the bodhisattva in regard to gen- erosity etc.	1
is taught as being uniformly instrumental in providing benefit for all beings87, but its chief object in the śrävaka vehicle is the benefit for oneself.	0
Hence, the universal vehicle is superior88 to the śrävaka vehicle because it is engaged in assisting others.	1
Thus, when one states the motive [for its practice], the universal vehicle is superior in comparison with the śrävaka vehicle.	1
Its inexhaustibility is due to the manifestation of an inconceivable result of the accumulation of merit and	1
engaged in deeds of welfare for beings for as long as the world exists, (c) is not appeased even in the nirvāṇa realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence and (d)	1
the śrävaka vehicle, for the result of the accumulations of the śrävaka is said to be exhaustible because it is severed completely on the part of those who have attained the	1

( N64.10 [5] Alternatively, the aim of the universal vehicle which consists in generosity etc.	0
is devoted to the assistance of all beings; however, the aim of the śrävaka vehicle is not the same since it is intent upon benefit for oneself.	1
Moreover, the bodhisattvas' dharmas, such as generosity, which are brought about owing to the purity of their bodies, are not interrupted even in parinirvāṇa.	1
However, because of the analogy of the path of the śrāvaka as a raft⁹0, [the dharmas] are completely eradicated in parinirvăņa, thus they are not inexhaustible.	1
Therefore, it is appropriate that the Dharmic acts provide a great result only in the universal vehicle and not in the śrāvaka vehicle.	1
Dharma Which is the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma?	1
V.11 ab Spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma is that which becomes free from: (i) distraction and (ii) erroneous inversion;	0
the twofold spiritual practices that conform with the Dharma, namely, (i) that which becomes free from distraction and (ii) that which becomes free from erroneous inversion.	1
[Sthiramati] 213.22 [1] The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma should be mentioned imme- diately after the spiritual practice in relation to mental attention, consequently, he asks: which is the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma?	0
Hence it is said: V.11 ab Spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma is that which becomes free from: (i) distraction and (ii) erroneous inversion;9	1
is adapted to the Dharma, that is to be meditated upon and known, which consists in	1

Bhaşya N64.11..64.15 the meditative development of tranquillization and penetrating insight 92 that have been entered into.	0
Of these, that which becomes free from distraction consists in the meditative development of tranquillization and that which becomes free from erroneous inversion consists in the meditative development of penetrating insight.	1
That which becomes Free from Distraction.	1
The freedom from distraction in this regard is due to the absence of six types of distraction.	1
These six types of distraction are: (a) innate distraction, (b) external distraction, (c) internal distraction, (d) the dis- traction of signs, (e) distraction consisting in disquiet and (f) distrac- tion to mental attention.	1
How should the characteristic of each of these be understood?	1
He says: V.11 cd & 12 abcd (a) Emergence, (b) dispersal towards sense objects, (c) relishment, indo- lence and excitability 93, (d) the ten- dency to [self] esteem, (e) 'I-notion' with mental attention and (f) an infer- ior mentality these are the distrac- tions to be clearly comprehended by one who possesses intelligence.	0
should be clearly comprehended by the bodhisattva.	1
Of these, (a) innate distraction refers to one's emergence from meditative develop- ment through the groups of the five consciousnesses.	1
(b) External distraction refers to the dispersal towards a sense-object.	1
(c) Internal distraction refers to the relishing of meditative concentration and indo- lence and excitability.	1
(d) The distraction of the 'sign' refers to the intention for [self] esteem, having created this 'sign' through applica- tion.	1
(e) Distraction that consists in disquiet refers to the mental atten- tiveness accompanied by 'I-notion' because pride manifests through the force of disquiet.	1
(f) Distraction to mental attention refers to the inferior mentality because of the manifestation of the mental attention of the inferior vehicle.	1

[Sthiramati] 214.7 [1] Since this prefix 'a' occurs in many senses, it is not known as to which of these [is applicable] in the term "freedom from distraction" (a-vikṣepa), hence he says: the freedom from distraction in this regard is due to the absence of six types of distraction.	0
And since it is not known as to how distraction can be six- fold, he says: these six types of distraction are: (a) innate distraction, (b) external distraction etc.	1
94 etc.	0
Although this is so, distraction has only been shown by way of its differentiation but not by way of its essential nature, thus he asks: how should the characteristic of each of these six types of distraction be understood?⁹5 Hence he says: V.11 c	0
The expression: "by one who possesses intelligence" [means] the intelligent one, i.e.	1
the bodhisattva.	1
Of these, one's emergence from meditative concentration through the groups of the five consciousnesses...; for, when one of any of the five consciousnesses, such as sight, arise in one who is meditatively concentrated, he has then emerged from meditative concentration this is innate distraction because it is occupied with externals.	1
The emergence from meditative concentration through the groups of the five consciousnesses is described as innate distraction because it consists in the distraction that pertains to the groups of the five conscious-	1
a sense-object etc.	1
[2] External distraction refers to the dispersal⁹6 towards a sense-object.	1
Some believe that when the mind-consciousness of one who is meditatively concen- trated moves unintentionally away from the meditative objective to another objective	1
tive support.	0
Others believe that when one who is meditatively concentrated relin- quishes the meditative objective, the transference to another sense-object by mind- consciousness is external distraction.	1
[3] Internal distraction refers to the relishing of meditative concentra- tion, and indolence and excitability.	1
If one who is concentrated relishes a particular meditative concentration on account of moral defilement, such as craving, he becomes distracted from that pure meditative concentration due to the proximity of defiled concentration.	1
Also, he is distracted from that meditative concentration wherein tranquillization and penetrating insight are brought together on account of indolence	1

Since relishment, indolence and excitability are impairments for one who is concentrated 98, relishing etc.	1
are described as internal distractions.	1
[4] The distraction of the 'sign' refers to the intention for [self] esteem.	1
account of this 'sign' on the part of one who has applied himself to meditative concen- tration there is distraction from the wholesome side, whether it has been obtained or not, due to the waning away of his [original] aspiration this is described as the distraction of the 'sign'.	1
Here now he provides the reason: having created this 'sign' through application.	1
Having created the 'sign', i.e.	1
that intention for [self] esteem on account of the desire for a reputation for skill99, thinking that [thereby], because he has applied himself to meditative concentration, there would be esteem for himself.	0
ness accompanied by 'I-notion'.	1
Even while resolutely seeking the virtues of meditative concentration one who possesses mental attention, accompanied by I- notion 100, is associated with pride insofar as he may consider himself to be a meditator - and as a consequence of this he exalts himself and holds others in contempt.	1
Why does this mental attention consist in disquiet?	1
Hence he says: because pride mani- fests through the force of disquiet.	1
This is what is being said: distraction that is characterized by disquiet is [described as] the distraction that consists in disquiet¹01.	1
But what is disquiet?	1
It is the full maturation of the latent impressions of pride since pride manifest on account of it; thus [it is said]: "because pride manifests through the force of that [i.e.	1
disquiet]".	0
Others believe that disquiet refers to the false view of individuality.	1
[6] Distraction to mental attention refers to the inferior mentality.	1
tient beings and (c) being in company with people who are not good spiritual friends, the śrāvaka pratyekabuddha mentality arises in one who has applied himself to the mental attention of the universal vehicle but whose spiritual lineage as a śråvaka etc.	0

This is the inferior mentality because it has merely the benefit for one-	1

distraction to mental attention since it is a distraction to the mental attention of the universal vehicle.	1
Here now he provides the reason: because of the manifestation of the mental attention of the inferior vehicle103.	1
The inferior vehicle refers to the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles.	1
The manifestation of this mental attention distracts one from the mental attention of the universal vehicle because it is essentially occupied with [attainment of] parinirvāṇa for oneself - thus it is said that the distraction to mental attention refers to inferior mentality.	1
Thus this absence of the faults of the six types of distraction on the part of the bodhisattva is to be known as the meditative development of tranquillization 104.	1
That which Becomes Free from Erroneous Inversion.	1
Therein, the absence of erroneous inversion is to be known in rela- tion to ten kinds of entities, namely: V.13 abcd In regard to these: V.14 abcd (a) Syllables, (b) object, (c) mental activity, (d) non-dispersal, (e) & (f) the dual characteristics, (g) lack of purity and purity, (h) what is adven- titious, (i) absence of fear and (j) absence of arrogance.	0
The object both exists and does not exist (a) because of combination and familiarity and (b) because of sepa- ration and lack of familiarity this is	1
in relation to syllables.	1
When there is a combination of syllables as an uninterrupted articu- lation, they have significance due to familiarity inasmuch as one thinks: "this is the name of that".	1
In the contrary case, they are devoid of significance.	1

It appears as the duality, i.e.	1
as apprehended object and apprehend- ing subject, since it arises in the aspect of these [two] although it does not exist as such, i.e.	1
in the way in which it appears.	1
Seeing this in regard to the object is [equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inver- sion in relation to it.	1
The object is devoid of existence because of the non-existence of both apprehended object and apprehending subject; it is devoid of non-existence because of the real existence of its erroneous appearance as that [duality].	1
V.16 abcd Mental activity that consists in talk is developed by that [dualistic] talk and is the basis for it this is the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activity which is the ground for the manifestation of the duality.	0
Mental activity that consists in talk is fully developed by talk that pertains to the apprehended object and apprehending subject and is the basis for that conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
Thus, this is [equivalent to the absence of erro- neous inversion in relation to mental activity.	1
In relation to which mental activity?	1
In relation to that which forms the ground for the manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
For, this mental activity that consists in talk is to be known as the basis for the conceptual differentiation of apprehended object and apprehending	1

That which was just described as the existence or non-existence of the object is considered like a magical creation etc.	1
In the same way that a magical creation neither exists as an entity such as an elephant, nor is it non-existent because it exists as 'bare' error; so too does the object neither exist in the way in which it manifests, i.e.	1
as the appre- hended object and apprehending subject, nor is it non-existent because it exists as 'bare' error.	1
By the word "etc.	1
", similes such as mirages, dreams and the reflection of the moon on water are to be understood as	1

Since no dharma whatsoever is to be found that is exempt from the insubstantiality of the dharmas, therefore, the dharmadhātu is the uni-№68 versal characteristic of all the dharmas knowing that this is so is [equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the universal characteristic.	1

are due to the non-relinquishment and relinquishment of erroneously inverted mental activity this is the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to that.	1
A lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the non- relinquishment of erroneously inverted mental activity; purity [on its behalf] refers to the relinquishment of that knowing that this is so is [equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of purity and purity, respectively.	1
V.21 abcd This pair is adventitious, for, the dharmadhātu is pure by nature, like space, this is the absence of erro- neous inversion in relation to that.	0
Moreover, because the dharmadhātu is pure by nature, like space,	1
knowing that this is so is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to its adventitious nature.	1
V.22 abcd Defilement and purity do not belong to the dharmas nor to the personal entity because they do not exist, hence, there is neither fear nor arrogance this is the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to that.	0
There is no defilement nor purity on the part of the personal entity nor the dharmas because neither the personal entity exists nor do the dharmas.	1
Consequently, there is no defilement nor purification of any- one whatsoever.	1
Hence, concerning the side of defilement, there is no deficiency on the part of anyone and concerning the side of purification, there is no excellence on the part of anyone on account of which fear and arrogance [respectively] would result.	1
This is [equivalent to] the216.15 absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of arrogance.	0
[Sthiramati] [1] Thus, the manner in which the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma and which becomes free from erroneous inversion is to be cultivated by one who is devoid of distraction is now described.	1
That which becomes free from erroneous inversion is that which arises in the nature of the absence of erroneous inversion.	1
The absence of erroneous inversion in this regard refers to the knowledge of an entity exactly as it is.	1
Now, in how many types of entity does such an entity consist?	1
Since this is not known, he says: therein, the absence of erroneous inversion is to be known in relation to ten types of entity; in order to demonstrate those entities that are free from erroneous inversion, he says: namely: V.13 ab (a) Syllables, (b) object, (c) mental activity, (d) non-dispersal, (e) the dual characteristics etc.	1
Now, in order to demonstrate the way in which the absence of erroneous inversion relates to these entities, he says: in regard to these: V.14 abcd The object both exists and does not exist, (a) because of combination and familiarity 105 and (b) because of sepa- ration and lack of familiarity 106 this is the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables.	0
When there is a combination of syllables...; "combination" refers to the close contact of one with another and this is not found on the part of [spoken] syllables because they cannot co-exist since the simultaneous articulation of syllables is not logi- cally tenable.	1
order to dispel the uncertainty that a preceding articulation 107 does not remain 108 at the time that subsequent syllables are articulated because they pass away immediately after they are articulated, he says: as an uninterrupted articulation.	0
This is what is being said: an articulation that is not erroneously inverted or sluggish is considered in this regard as a combination of syllables, but the close contact of sylla- bles, one with another, is not.	1
Due to familiarity 109, inasmuch as one thinks: "this is the name of that"; i.e.	1
when conventional symbols are learnt by heart, one thinks: "this is the name of that entity", thus, through these two modes [i.e.	1

understood.	1
In the contrary case, they are devoid of significancel10; the contrary case refers to the absence of both, or the lack of one of the two.	1
Seeing that this is so, i.e.	1
the knowledge [that this is so], is to be known as the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense because the absence of erroneous inversion in an ultimate sense is devoid of conceptual differentiation111.	1
Thus, through this absence of erroneous inver- sion, the bodhisattva penetrates all dharmas free from the meaning of words [i.e.	1
he understands without concepts (vikalpa) expressed in words (sabda)].	0
[2] Now in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in rela- tion to the object which is the cause for its designation by means of syllables, he says: V.15 ab It appears as the duality but is non- existent as such etc.	1
It appears as the duality, i.e.	1
as apprehended object and apprehending	1
'seed' of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
But what is the meaning of	1
[two]; i.e.	0
it appears as the apprehended object and apprehending subject because it arises in the aspect of apprehended object and apprehending subject; but this is not due to the influence of an adjunct, like a crystal.	1
"But is non-existent as such", although it does not exist as such, i.e.	1
in the way, or in the aspect, in which it appears¹12 because it is non-dual by nature.	1
Seeing this in regard to the object, as it is the cause for the arising of the erroneous consciousness, is [equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to it.	1
The intended meaning is that it avoids [the extremes of] existence and non-existence.	1
The object is devoid of existence; here now he provides the reason: because of the non-existence of both apprehended object and apprehending subject 13, The existence of the object [implies] the real existence of apprehended object and apprehending subject; [the object] is devoid of that because it is empty of the aspect of apprehended object and apprehending subject.	0
It is devoid of non-existence...; what is the reason?	1
Because of the real existence of the erroneous appear- ance as that [duality].	1
What is meant is: because of the real existence of the erro- neous appearance as apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
And this is said to be an absence of erroneous inversion in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate	1

ledge free from erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva penetrates all dharmas as being devoid of the essential nature of apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
[3] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the store-consciousness which is the cause for the manifestation¹14 of the apprehended object and apprehending subject¹15, he says: V.16 ab Mental activity that consists in talk is developed by that [dualistic] talk and is the basis for it etc.	1
Mental activity that consists in talk is fully developed by talk that pertains to the apprehended object and apprehending subject 16.	1
With regard to the object that has the characteristic of the manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, one has the thought: "that is the object and this is the subject" such a spoken or mental utterance is described as "talk".	1
What is fully developed by this talk is described as "developed" since it causes the maturation of the 'seed' for the production of talk of the same genre in the future.	1
It is called the mental activity that consists in talk because it is fully developed by talk, for the cause is figu- ratively expressed in the sense of the effect [which it produces].	1
However, in this context, talk refers to the latent impressions of talk since talk exists in those [impressions] considering that there is no differentiation between the support and that to be supported [i.e.	1
talk and mental activity].	0
Alternatively, because there is no mention of the word "support" [i.e.	1
one is not the support of the other], one speaks of mental activity that consists in talk since it is the support for the 'seed' of the con- ceptual differentiation117 of apprehended object and apprehending	1
dependence upon the latter, thus, this is [equivalent to] the absence of erro- neous inversion in relation to mental activity.	0
What is meant is: the know- ledge that is not erroneously inverted.	1
But this mental activity, in relation to which there is an absence of erroneous inversion, is not known, hence he asks: in relation to which 19 mental activity is there an absence of erroneous inversion?	1
Hence, in order to specify that mental activity, he says: in relation to that which forms the ground for the manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehend- ing subject.	1
What is meant is: it consists in a special aspect of the store-conscious- ness.	1
In order to demonstrate the way in which the latter forms the ground for the	1

by verbal notions.	1
It is the fact that it [i.e.	1
the store-consciousness] forms the ground for the manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject that is referred to.	1
Alternatively, as to mental activity that consists in talk, in order to demonstrate that this causes one's engagement in verbal notions, he has said ¹20: "it is described as mental activity that consists in talk because it is fully developed by verbal notions".	1
Verbal notions refer to notions that arise from speech, or which cause the arising of speech.	1
It is on account of these [notions] together with their associated elements, that the mental activity consisting in talk is described as "fully developed", because they cause the maturation of the individual 'seeds' in the mental activity that consists in talk.	1
This too is an absence of erroneous inversion just in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense.	0
Moreover, through this absence of erroneous inver- sion, the bodhisattva avoids the underlying cause of erroneous inversion which is characterized by notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending	1
[4] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dispersal, he says: V.17 ab That which was just described as the existence or non-existence of the object... How was it just described?	1
[As the following]: It appears as the duality but is non-existent	1

[V.15] The existence and non-existence of the object is considered like a magi- cal creation etc.	1
It is considered like a magical creation etc.	1
"Like a magical creation etc."	1
[means]: like entities that are magical creations etc.	0
In order to demonstrate just this, he says: in the same way that a magical creation neither exists as an entity such as an elephant, since it manifests in the nature of an elephant etc.	1
which is non-existent in itself123.	0
Although it is said that it does not exist as an entity such as an elephant, it is not non-existent in every respect on the contrary 124: nor is it non-	1

respect because of the existence of that 'bare' error that manifests in the aspect of an elephant etc.	1
So too does the object neither exist in the way in which it manifests, i.e.	1
as apprehended object and apprehending subject, nor is it non-existent because of the existence of that 'bare' error which manifests as such in the essential nature126 of the mind and the mental concomitants that pertain to the three realms of existence ¹27.	1
By the word "etc.	1
", similes such as mirages, dreams and the reflection of the moon on water etc.	1
are to be under- stood, as is appropriate.	1
For the mirages, dreams and reflections of the moon on water etc.	1
128 neither exist in the way in which they appear in the nature of water, men and women¹29, nor indeed do they not exist ¹30 because of the existence of 'bare' error.	1
[simile].	0
Moreover, by the word "etc."	1
in this context131, cities of Gandharvas and echoes etc.	1
are to be understood.	1
That which sees in this way, without distrac- tion, the non-dispersal of mind towards the sides of existence and non-existence, because it sees in the object its resemblance 132 to a magical creation etc.	1
133, is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversión in relation to non-dispersal.	0
But what is non-dispersal?	1
Some believe that it consists in the meditative concentration of the middle way134.	1
If this is so, how can there be an absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dispersal?	1
Hence he says: because the non-dispersal of mind¹35 toward existent or non-existent entities is on account of it.	1
Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva is	1

the absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to existence and non-existence136.	0
Therefore, it is described as the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dis- persal 137.	1
And this is an absence of erroneous inversion in just a conventional sense, but not in an ultimate sense, for the latter is devoid of conceptual differentiation.	0
[5] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual characteristic, he says: V.18 ab The fact that everything is name-only	1
ceptual differentiation 138 etc.	0
All this is name-only, i.e.	1
that which¹39 comprises [the sense-fields of] sight/form up until mind/non-sensibles hence all that comprises the twelve sense-fields is to be known as name-only.	1
The designation, in this respect, comprises the own-being and the particulars of the name; also, the own-being of either the object to be designated or the designation does not exist because: (a) it is imaginatively con- structed in such a nature and (b) what is imaginatively constructed does not exist.	1
Otherwise, apprehending would take place through sight etc.	1
140 regardless of the name, yet there can be no apprehending141 of a conventional symbol that is not known.	0
Therefore, because that object implied by the terms sight/form etc.	1
does not have the own-being of that [sight/form], [the sense-fields of sight/form up until mind/non- sensibles are indeed name-only, [hence] knowing that this is so [acts] as the counteragent to all conceptual differentiation 142.	0
This is [equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual charac- teristic.	1
One engages in all conceptual differentiation in regard to all dharmas by way of imaginary dharmas¹43.	1
Hence, the knowledge which penetrates [the realization that all is] name-only and which is the counteragent to all conceptual differentiation, is described as the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual character- istic.	1
However, it is not known in this regard whether the latter refers to the individual characteristic in an ultimate sense or in a conventional sense, consequently he asks: in	0

erroneous inversion is: V.18 d In relation to the individual charac-	0
Because the individual characteristic, in an ultimate sense, is inexpressible but not so in a conventional sense.	1
What is the reason?	1
Because the notion that this is name- only in a conventional sense, is not accepted144; for, imaginative construc- tions 145 arise in relation to the essential nature of a dharma through speech; however, this is just in a conventional sense and not in an ultimate sense because it is the process of conceptual differentiation that recognizes that it is name-only.	1
Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva becomes skilled in both the conventional and the ultimate.	1
[6] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the universal characteristic, he says: V.19 ab Since no dharma is to be found out- side the dharmadhātu¹46 etc.	1
For, no dharma whatsoever whether material or non-material is to be found that is exempt from the insubstantiality of the dharmas, because all dharmas are inexpressible and non-dual¹47 by nature since they are devoid of the rela- tion of apprehended object and apprehending subject.	1
Therefore, the dharma- dhātu is the universal characteristic of all dharmas; it is described as the universal characteristic of [all] these existing [dharmas]148 as it is not different in all dharmas.	1
Knowing that this is so is [equivalent to] the absence of erro- neous inversion in relation to the universal characteristic¹49; i.e.	1
in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense because the latter is devoid of concep- tual differentiation.	0
Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva becomes skilled in the objective support of purity because it is the object of direct intuition free from conceptual differentiation.	1
[7] How does one distinguish between the universal characteristic and the individual characteristic?	1
The characteristic in the ultimate sense150 lefers to the inexpressible essential nature [which acts] as the counteragent¹51 to the superimposed essential	1

insubstantial imaginary nature which is innate to all dharmas.	1
Thus, this distinction is in accord with a difference in perspectives but is not due to the object.	1
[8] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of purity or the purity on the part of the dharmadhātu, he says: V.20 bc ...Are due to the non-relinquishment and relinquishment of erroneously inverted 152 mental activity etc.	0
A lack of purity 153 on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the non- relinquishment of erroneously inverted 154 mental activity; the purity [on its behalf] refers to the relinquishment of that.	1
In this respect, erroneously	1
sion and is the ground of the store-consciousness.	1
The lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the non-relinquishment of the latter 156; purity [on its behalf] refers to its relinquishment.	1
Knowing that this is so is [equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of purity and purity, respectively.	1
The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the fact that the non-relinquishment of erroneously inverted 157 mental activity is [equivalent to] the lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhātu.	0
The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to its purity refers to the fact that its relinquishment is [equivalent to] purity [on its behalf].	1
What is the reason?	1
Because the dharmadhatu is defiled by adventitious secondary defilement.	1
an ultimate sense; and, through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva clearly comprehends: (a) the obscuration to the dharmadhātu that has not been relin- quished and (b) that which has been relinquished.	1
[9] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the adventitious nature of both the lack of purity and the purity on the part of the dharma- dhātu, he says: V.21 ab ...For, the dharmadhitu is pure by nature, like space etc.	0
Moreover, because the dharmadhatu is pure by nature, like space, this pair, i.e.	1
its lack of purity and subsequent purity 158, is adventitious.	0

[superficially] defiled by unreal conceptual differentiation; its purity [is mentioned] because one subsequently relinquishes that [secondary defilement] through the arising of the counteragent and both of these are adventitious to the dharmadhātu.	0
What is the reason?	1
Because the innate purity of the dharmadhātu is like that of space.	1
[Objection]: A lack of purity on the part of what is pure by nature may be adventitious, but, since its purity is an eternal purity, how can it be adventitious?	1
[Response]: This fault is not [applicable] since, in this context, this purity is intended 159 as an absence of stain; only because of this is it stated that its purity is subsequent.	0
Knowing that this is so in regard to the dharmadhătu¹60 is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the adventitious nature of both the lack of purity and the purity on the part of the dharmadhătu.	1
This too is [an absence of erroneous inversion] in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense.	0
Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattval61 clearly comprehends the fabricated nature162 of the states of defilement and purification in regard to the dharmadhātu.. [10] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of arrogance, he says: V.22 ab Defilement and purity do not belong to the dharmas nor to the personal entity etc.	1
There is no defilement nor purity on the part of the personal entity 163 nor the dharmas; [the words]: "defilement and purity" remain in force in regard to the latter [i.e.	1
the dharmas].	0
Here now he provides the reason: because neither the personal entity exists, nor do the dharmas; [the word] "exists" remains in force in regard to the latter¹64.	1
At the time of the states of defilement and purifi- cation 165, if [an entity] exists separately from defilement and purification it would be tenable to imagine that it can possess defilement or purification, and diminution and increase 166 would also exist separately from that [entity].	1
[However], there is no personal entity such as that because it is not an object of direct perception or inference.	1
Also, the dharmas which possess an imaginary nature are certainly non-existent	1

not tenable that the one [entity] can have numerous natures.	1
Consequently, because both the personal entity and the dharmas are non-existent, like the son of an infertile woman etc., there is no defilement or purification; the possession of defilement and purity is not epted 167	1
the sphere of pure mundane direct intuition.	1
For what reason?	1
Because it is inex- pressible and non-dual by nature.	1
[Objection]: If [defilement and purity] are not even accepted 168 as belonging to the other-dependent [nature], to which [nature] would they belong for the effort directed towards the relinquishment of defilement and the acquisi- tion of purity169 would be in vain if they [i.e.	1
defilement and purity] did not exist?	0
[Response]: This fault is not [applicable] since defilement and purity belong to the dharmadhātu, [or rather] although they are respectively determined as belonging to the dharmadhātu, they are certainly not identical with it because they are both adventitious to the dharmadhatu 170 and, like space, the dharmadhātu does not change.	0
Hence, concerning the side of defilement, there is no deficiency whatsoever and concerning the side of purification, there is no excellence whatsoever¹71	1
is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and the lack of arrogance.	1
[11] However, others say that in regard to the side of defilement, there is no deficiency on the part of anyone and in regard to the side of purification, there is no excellence172	1
way 173, how, in this respect, can one either fear that: "this is not mine", or have the prideful notion that: "this174 excellence belongs to me"?	1
[12] Others again believe that in the first place the personal entity does not exist and a dharma which experiences the two states and to which the two are imagined to belong also does not exist.	1
On the contrary, this defilement and purification is none other than dependent origination.	1
[13] This too is [intended] in the conventional but not in the absolute sense!	0

[14] Others believe that [the bodhisattva] goes forth free from obscuration after having relinquished all obscuration through this absence of erroneous inversion.	1
Alternatively, the absence of erroneous inversion in an absolute sense is indicated here by way of the tenfold absences of erroneous inversion which consist in the conven- tional 177, since it is not possible to explain it in any other way.	1
Others say that these	1
dispersal, individual characteristic, universal characteristic, lack of purity, purity, what is adventitious, lack of fear and lack of arrogance also refer to the three natures 178.	1
Of these, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables and object refer to the imaginary nature because both [the notions of] combination and object that has 'fallen' into duality are imaginary.	1
Although they do not have a reality for their object, these two do consist in an absence of erroneous inversion since they are without erroneous inversion as such in this way.	1
The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activity 179 refers to the other-dependent nature because the mental activity that consists in talk is intrinsic to the nature of the store-consciousness.	1
The absence of erroneous inversion ¹80 in relation to non-dispersal181 refers to the perfected nature.	1
Why?	1
Because: (a) direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differentiation is not distracted [by conjecture] about existent or non-existent [entities] and (b) the latter is incorporated in the perfected nature since it is perfection as an absence of erroneous inversion182.	0
The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual and universal charac- teristics refers just to the dharmadhatu because the essential nature of the latter tran-	1
relation to both the lack of purity and purity refers to a special state of the dharma- dhātu.	1
The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to what is adventitious refers to that same dharmadhātu; for it is due to the mental defilement and the mental purity of that which, like space, is pure by nature that the two [purity and its lack] are respec- tively determined as adventitious.	1

These tenfold absences of erroneous inversion are to be understood in this way in relation to the three natures.	1
The Ten Vajra Words Furthermore, these ton absences of erroneous inversion are to be connected respectively with the ten vajra words.	1
The ten vajra words are: (i) existerce and non-existence, (ii) the absence of erroneous inver- sion, (iii) the basis, (iv) the resemblance to a magical creation, (v) the absence of conceptual differentiation, (vi) intrinsic luminosity, (vii) defilement and purification, (viii) the resemblance to space, (ix) non- deficiency and (x) non-excellence.	1
The 'body' of the vajra words is established by way of: (a) own- being, (b) objective support, (c) absence of conceptual differentiation and (d) objections and refutations.	1
Of these, (a) "by way of own- being" refers to the three natures called 'perfected', 'imaginary' and 'other-dependent' corresponding respectively with the first three [vajra] words, 183 (b) "By way of objective support" refers to these same [three] natures.	1
(c) "By way of the absence of conceptual differen- tiation" refers to: (i) that on account of which one does not conceptually differentiate, i.e.	1
direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation, and (ii) that which does not perform conceptual differentiation in regard to intrinsic luminosity.	1
Then, by means of these, the establishment of both the object of knowledge and the act of knowing is to be under- stood respectively, namely, through the three natures and the absence of conceptual differentiation.	1
(d) "By way of objections and refutations" refers to the remaining [vajra] words.	1
This is the objection in this regard: "If these dharmas which are characterized by the imaginary and the other-dependent [natures] are non-existent, how can they be per- ceived?	1
On the other hand if they do exist, the intrinsic luminosity of the dharmas is not tenable."	1
One refutes this through their resemblance to a magical creation, i.e.	1
on the grounds that what comprises a magical creation does not exist yet it is perceived.	1
[An objection]: "If the dharmas possess intrinsic luminosity, how can they be defiled initially	0
whereas in the Sanskrit Bhäşya all three are found at the end of this section.Y227	0
are to be understood according to their resemblance to space, i.e.	1
on the grounds that space, which is pure by nature, can be defiled and then purified.	1
[An objection]: "If there is the removal of the moral defile- ment184 of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings when immeasurable numbers of Buddhas are born, how is it that samsāra is not eradicated and nirvana is not augmented?"	1
Its refutation is on the grounds of non- deficiency and non-excellence, because the realms of sentient beings and 'sides' to purification are immeasurable.	1
Secondly, the 'body' is established as follows: (a) Wherein, whatever and whence is error and (b) wherein and whatever is non-error and indeed (c) the re- sults of both error and non-error and	1
(i) Existence and non-existence, (ii) the absence of erroneous inversion, (iii) the basis, (iv) the resemblance to a magical creation, (v) the absence of conceptual differentiation, (vi)	1
(vii) Defilement and purification, (viii) the resemblance to space, (ix) non-deficiency and (x) non-excel- lence;	1

[Sthiramati] 7226.14 [1] These ten absences of erroneous inversion that have just been described are to be connected respectively with the ten vajra words described in the Sūtras.	1
Which are the ten vajra words?	1
They are: (i) existence and non- existence, (ii) the absence of erroneous inversion, (iii) the basis, (iv) the resemblance to a magical creation, (v) the absence of conceptual	1

These are [of the nature of] a vajra because: (a) like a vajra, they penetrate all erroneous inversion and (b) the former cannot be penetrated by the latter.	1
This is [equivalent to] the knowledge of the absence of erroneous inversion that has just been described [in the last section].	1
And since this 188 vajra[-like knowledge] is illustrated, i.e.	1
is made known, through them, they are [described as] the vajra words; what is meant is: vajra-like explanations.	1
Furthermore, it is [the ten words of the previous section] beginning with "syllable", "object" and "mental activity" that are signified by the term "word".	1
Consequently, "words of the vajra" means: 'objective supports of the vajra; alternatively, these words are described as vajra words because, like a vajra, they are difficult to split189.	1
The vajra words are specifically mentioned in this context because the absences of erroneous inversion must be connected with the Sutras.	1
Alternatively, it is to demonstrate that this explanation of the vajra words is	1
non-existence of the meaning of syllables is [equivalent to the vajra word] "existence and non-existence"; hence, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables is to be known as referring to "existence and non-existence" [listed] among the vajra words.	1
(b) The appearance as the duality which is imaginary refers to the "object" in this context and the [knowledge] that it is non-existent as such refers to the absence of erroneous inversion in this regard.	1
Thus, the absence of erroneous inversion in rela- tion to the object is to be connected with the "absence of erroneous inversion" [listed] among the vajra words.	1
(c) Since that same mental activity that consists in talk is a 'basis' in this context, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activity is to be connected with the "basis" (listed] among the vajra words.	1
(d) The absence of	1
its resemblance to a magical creation etc, 190, is to be connected with the "resemblance to a magical creation" [listed] among the vajra words 191.	1
(e) It is that same individual characteristic of the dharmadhātu that is [equivalent to the absence of conceptual differentiation since it is devoid of imaginative constructions; therefore, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual characteristic is to be regarded as the	1

(g) Since a special lack of purity194 and a special purity on the part of the dharmadhātu is [equivalent to] its defilement and purification 195, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of purity and purity is included by [the vajra word] "defilement and purification".	1
(h) Moreover, the absence of erroneous inversion 196 in relation to the adventitious nature of defilement and purification on the part of the dharmadhātu is to be connected with the "resemblance to space".	1
(i) & (j) Since there is no destruction or growth of the dharmadhātu in relation to its states of defilement and purification, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of arrogance is to be connected with "non-deficiency" and "non-excellence" [listed] among the vajra words.	1
These ten absences of erroneous inversion are to be connected 197 respectively with the ten vajra words in this way.	1
[2] The 'body' of the vajra words is established as follows: the vajra words are employed with reference to 198 certain categories these categories form their body'.	1
However, they are also established as fourfold, i.e.	1
by way of: (a) own-being, (b) objective support, (c) absence of conceptual differentiation and (d) objections and refutations.	0
[3] Of these, the three natures called 'perfected', 'imaginary' and 'other-dependent' correspond respectively with the first three [vajra] words.	1
Therein, the first [three] 199 are: "existence and non-existence", "the absence of erroneous inversion" and "the basis".	1
Of these, by "existence and non-existence", the perfected [nature] is referred to; by "the absence of erroneous inversion", the imaginary [nature] is referred to; by "the basis", the other-dependent [nature] is referred to.	1
How so?	1
Certain people believe that the perfected is explained as both existent and non-existent because it both exists and does not exist200.	1
How can it be due to the fact that the perfected [nature] has the characteristic of both existence and non-existence?201 Some believe that this is because it is verbally expressed as existent	1

familiarity, one sees the object as having significance insofar as it is mentally constructed and, in the contrary case, one sees it as being devoid of significance, [thus], it is understood that the perfected nature is inexpressible.	0
Hence, this [vajra word] "existence and non-existence" is said to refer to the perfected nature.	1
Others again believe that the Dharma that comprises the teachings of the universal vehicle is described as the perfected nature because: (a) it flows out of the extremely pure dharma- dhātu and (b) it is the objective support which acts as counteragent to erroneous inver- sion; and although, as an objective entity its essential nature is conceptually differentiated 202, it is not imaginary.	1
Hence, [the vajra word] "existence and non- existence" is said to refer to the perfected.	1
However, others say that "existence and non-existence" is said to refer to the perfected nature because it is not erroneously inverted 203.	0
The imaginary is [described] as being without erroneous inversion204 because it is characterized 205 by manifesting in the nature of the duality which does not exist.	0
The other-dependent is described verbally as "the basis"206; it is described as the basis because it is the (causal) ground and is described as other-dependent because it is the result.	1

Since there are different ways of resolving this compound in this context, he says: (i) that on account of which one does not conceptually differentiate, i.e.	1
direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation and (ii) that which does not perform conceptual differentiation in regard to intrinsic luminosity.	1
These are the different ways of resolving the compound208 (avikalpanatā): (a) there is an absence of conceptual differentiation (avikalpana) since, on account of this, one does not conceptually differentiate and (b) there is an absence of conceptual differen- tiation (avikalpana) since it [i.e.	1
intrinsic luminosity] is not conceptually differentiated.	0
The state (bhava) of that is [equivalent to] the absence of conceptual differentiation (avikalpanatā).	0

[6] By way of objections and refutations that are employed refers to the remaining vajra words210, With regard to this, certain vajra words actually are refutations of objections; examples of these are "the resemblance to a magical creation", "the resemblance to space", "non-deficiency" and "non-excellence".	1
However, some [vajra words] are just objections, for example, "defilement and purification".	1
There- fore, [the vajra word] "objections and refutations" (codyaparihara) can be [interpreted both as] 'refutations of objections' and 'objections'; together they produce 'objections and refutations' (codyaparihārau)211, considering the rule (cf.	0
Panini III.1.94 & I.II.64) that of two 'original' words (i.e.	0
codyaparihara and codya), only one remains (i.e.	1
codyaparihārau).	0
This212 is the objection in this regard: "If these dharmas which are characterized by the imaginary and other-dependent [natures] are non-existent..., the ellipsis is: as apprehended object and apprehending subject, how can they be perceived?	1
I.e., as apprehended object and apprehending subject	1
luminosity of the dharmas is not tenable"; because they exist in the aspects of	1
this through their resemblance to a magical creation, i.e.	1

For a magical creation exists as a perception; consequently, its existence as such cannot be known.	1
An objection: if the dharmas possess intrinsic luminosity, how can they be defiled initially213 and subsequently purified?	1
For, if they are pure by nature, the defiled state is never possible.	1

Thus, although it is pure by nature, the defilement on the part of the dharmadhātu is on account of adventitious secondary defilement and purification	1
removal of the moral defilement216 of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings when immeasurable numbers of Buddhas are born, how is that217, although the Buddhas are born individually in beginningless samsåra, samsara is not eradicated and nirvapa is not augmented due to the removal of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings from samsāra and their entry to nirvāṇa?	1
Its refutation is on the grounds of non-deficiency and non-excellence, because the realms of sentient beings and 'sides' to purification are immeasurable.	1
For, the diminution or eradication of something which possesses limitations can be conceived218 but the realm of sentient beings is immeasurable and its diminution cannot be conceived, how much less can its eradication, like that of space, possibly be conceived?	1
Since there is indeed no excellence of purification too because of its immeasurable nature, how can there be augmentation on its part, like with space, because both the removal of obscuration and the arising of obscuration belong to it?	1
[7] Secondly, the 'body' is established 219 as follows, i.e.	1
with reference to the vajra words: (a) Wherein, whatever and whence is error and (b) wherein and whatever is non-error and indeed (c) the results of both error and non-error	1

error, because it manifests in the aspect of the duality but is non-existent in itself.	1
"Whence is error" refers to the fact that error comes from a basis this basis is the mental activity that is developed by talk and which consists in the store-consciousness.	1
"And whatever is non-error" refers to the absence of error, i.e.	1
non-dispersal towards the existence or non-existence of the object which is [in reality] like a magical creation etc.	1
The absence of error is the counteragent to the error which consists in the notional attachment to existent and non-existent entities and these are explained respectively through their resemblance to a magical creation and the absence of conceptual differen- tiation224.	1
"And wherein" refers to where there is an absence of error; moreover, this refers to intrinsic luminosity which has the characteristic of the perfected nature.	1
"And indeed the results of error and non-error": in this regard, defilement is the result of error the ellipsis is i.e.	1
the natural outcome of error.	1
Since the absence of error consists in the natural outcome of the absence of error225, the result of the absence of error is purification because it is the result of the absence of error the ellipsis is - [purification] together with its associates.	1
The use of the particle "indeed" refers to these two results described by [the vajra word] 'defilement and purification'; however, in order to demonstrate that through [the vajra word] 'the resemblance to space', the results of both error and the absence of error on the part of the dharmadhātu is seen to have the nature of defilement and purification, but they are not intrinsic to it.	1
"And the end of these two": some people believe that this refers to the end of both defilement and purification, i.e.	1
nirvāṇa; moreover, the latter is described as the 'end'226 insofar as it is without deficiency and excellence.	1
However, others believe that the end of defile- ment is [equivalent to] the possession of non-deficiency because [defilement] does not accumulate due to the immeasurable nature of samsära; and the end of purification is [equivalent to] the possession of non-excellence227 because [purification] does not increase due to the immeasurable nature of nirvāṇa.	1
[8] These ten vajra words have been described through their connection with the absence of erroneous inversion; however, since they do not derive from a Sutra, they are included by way of two internal verses: (i) Existence and non-existence, (ii) the absence of erroneous inversion, (iii) the basis, (iv) the resemblance to a magical creation, (v) the absence	1

228 Read: (vii) Defilement and purification, (viii) the resemblance to space, (ix) non-deficiency and (x) non-excell- ence 229 these are the ten vajra words.	1
[9] In this context, (a) the view that the connection between a word and its object belongs to the perfected [nature] is erroneous inversion.	1
(b) The view that objects exist by way of essential nature in exactly that way in which they appear is erroneous inver- sion.	1
(c) The view [that incorporates] the cause for the arising of the object is erro- neous inversion 230, (d) The views that [incorporate] imputation or negation in regard to the object are erroneous inversion.	1
(e) The view that the own-being of the object is in accord with its nominal designation231 is erroneous inversion.	1
(f) & (g) The views that regards the individual or universal characteristics 232 of entities as substantially existent are erroneous inversion.	1
(h) The view that the purity or the lack of purity of actions is due to auspicious or inauspicious behaviour is erroneous inversion.	1
The view that both the lack of purity and purity belong to one and the same [entity] is erro- neous inversion.	1
(i) & (j) The manifestation of fear and arrogance because of the belief in deficiency and excellence in regard to the relinquishment and acquisition of defile- ment and purification [respectively] is erroneous inversion.	1
These are the ten erroneous inversions; because they are non-existent on the part of the bodhisattva, [the spiritual practice] which becomes free from erroneous inversion in relation to the cate- gories as described should be known as the meditative development of penetrating insight233.	1
The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma has now been described.	1

Which is the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes?	1
That which is taught as the middle way in the Ratnakūţa.	1
This is to be known as being due to the avoidance of which extremes?	1
V.24 abcd V.25 abcd V.26 abcd The extremes concerning separate- ness and identity, those of the tirthika and śravaka, the twofold extremes of imputation and negation in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas.	0
The extremes concerning adverse elements and their counteragents, those termed eternalism and annihi- lationism, the twofold and threefold [extremes] concerning the appre- hended object and apprehending	1
purification.	1
consisting in conceptual differentia- tion are also considered in regard to: (a) existent and non-existent entities, (b) the object of appeasement and the [act of] appeasing, (c) the object of fear and the dread of the latter;	1
apprehending subject, (e) correctness and falsity, (f) performance and non-performance] and (g) non- origination and simultaneity these are the dual extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
Of these, (a) the notion that the self is something separate from form etc.	1
is one extreme; the notion that it is identical is another extreme.	1
which does not investigate a self, concluding with the non-investigation319 of the human kind, for, among the views concerning a self, there is one view that holds the individual soul to be [identical with the physical body and [another view that holds] the individual soul to be one [entity] and the physical body another.	1
The notion that form is permanent is an extreme embraced by the tirthikas; the notion that it is impermanent is an extreme embraced by the śrävakas.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e.	1
that which does not investigate the permanence, nor does it investigate the impermanence, of form etc.	1
The notion that the self exists234 is the extreme of imputation in regard to the personal entity; the notion that it is insubstantial is the extreme of negation, for, there is the negation of just that which exists as a designation.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e.	1
the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation which holds the mean position between [the existence of a self and its insubstantiality.	1
The notion that mind is real is the extreme of imputation in regard to the dharmas; the notion that it is not real is the extreme of negation.	1
consciousness.	1
The notion that the dharmas, such as those that are unwholesome, are [equivalent to] defilement is an extreme in regard to adverse elements; the notion that the wholesome ones etc.	1
are [equivalent to] purification is an extreme in regard to the counteragent.	0
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e.	1
that which con- sists in the non-acceptance, non-utterance and non-communication of these two extremes.	1
The notion that both the personal entity and the armas exist is the extreme of eternalism; the notion that they do not exist is the extreme of annihilationism.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these since it holds a mean position between the two extremes.	1
The notion that nescience consists in the apprehended object and apprehending subject 235 is one extreme; likewise the notion that know- ledge, the formative forces and the unconditioned which is the counter- agent to the latter, up until old-age and death, consist in the	1

checked by that path.	1
Thus, the extremes in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject are twofold according to their differ- entiation as belonging to the 'black' or the 'white' side.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these.	1
i.e.	1
in detail, both know- ledge and nescience are non-dual because of the absence of the apprehended object and the apprehending subject on the part of know- ledge and nescience etc.	1
Defilement is threefold: (a) the defilement of moral defilement, (b) the defilement of action and (c) the defilement of rebirth.	1
In regard to these, the defilement of moral defilement is threefold: (i) false view, (ii) the causes of passion, aversion and delusion and (iii) the resolve for a new existence.	1
The counteragents to these are: (i) emptiness know- ledge, (ii) signless knowledge and (iii) non-resolve knowledge.	1
The defilement of action refers to the formative influence of virtuous and non-virtuous actions.	1
The counteragent to these is knowledge without formative influence.	1
The defilement of rebirth refers to: (i) rebirth in a new existence, (ii) the production of the mind and the mental concomi- tants every moment in one who is reborn and- (iii) the continuance of a new existence.	1
The counteragents to these are: (i) non-birth knowledge, (ii) non-production knowledge and (iii) absence of own-being know- ledge.	1
The removal of these three kinds of defilement is [equivalent to] purification.	1
In this regard, through emptiness knowledge etc.	1
the dharmas that are the objects of emptiness knowledge etc., up to [the dharmas that are the objects of the absence of own-being knowledge], are not respectively caused to be emptiness etc.	1
on account of these three kinds of defilement, [rather], they are emptiness etc.	1
by their very nature because the dharmadhatu is undefiled by nature.	1
Therefore, if one imagines that the dharmadhatu is defiled or is purified, this is an extreme because there can be no defilement or purity on the part of that which is undefiled by nature.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding this extreme, i.e.	1
that which does not cause the dharmas to be empty through emptiness; on the contrary the dharmas are already empty and the same holds for the other [six categories of knowledge].	1
There are an additional seven kinds of dual extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation, for example, the conceptual differentiation in regard to an existent entity is one extreme and the conceptual differen-"2 tiation in regard to a non-existent entity is another extreme236.	1
These are due to imagining that: (a) emptiness is for the destruction of the belief in the existence of the personal entity, or else, (b) insubstantiality is non-existent.	1
This middle way is for the purpose of avoiding these dual extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
Emptiness is certainly not for the destruction of the belief in the personal entity, moreover, emptiness itself is empty.	1
In detail, the same holds for past emptiness and future emptiness etc.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the object of appeasement is one extreme and conceptual differentiation in regard to the [act of] appeasing is another extreme.	1
These are on account of imaginative con- structions in regard to the object of relinquishment and the [act of] relinquishing which are due to fear of emptiness.	1
The example of 'space' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the object of fear is one extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the dread of that object of fear [is another extreme].	1
These result from fear of imaginary forms etc.	1
and are on account of the dread of suffering.	1
The example of the 'painter' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that con- sist in conceptual differentiation.	1
The former example is in relation to the śrävaka, but the latter is [in relation to] the bodhisattva.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is one extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the apprehending subject [is another extreme].	1
The example of the 'magician' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
For, the knowledge of the non-existence of the object is caused by the knowledge of representation-only and the knowledge of the non-existence of the object annuls that very knowledge of repre- sentation-only because, if the object is non-existent, its representation is not possible; thus, these two are similar in this respect.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to correctness is one extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to falsity [is another extreme].	1
Both of these conceptually differentiate the investigation of what is real as correct or false.	1
The example of 'fire coming from two sticks' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes; i.e., just as fire is gener- ated from two sticks which are devoid of the characteristic of fire and [the fire] that is generated consumes those two sticks; similarly, the	1
generated from the investigation [of phenomenal as they are in reality	0
wisdom] that is generated annihilates [through clear understanding] that	1
And although the investigation of what is real is devoid of the charac- teristic of correctness, it does not have the characteristic of falsity because it is in conformity with correctness.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action is one extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the non-per- formance of action [is another extreme].	1
Both of these imagine direct intuition to involve an act that is preceded by intelligence, or else, as being devoid of efficacy.	1
The example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination is one extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to simultaneity [is another extreme], i.e., if one imagines that the counteragent does not arise, or else, [imagines] defilement to endure for a long time.	1
The second example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
The spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes has now been described.	1
[Sthiramati] Y233.9 [1] Immediately following the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma, the spiritual practice that relates to the avoidance of the two extremes237 should be mentioned.	0
Hence he asks: which is the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes?	1
So he says: that which is taught as the middle way in the Dharma discourse named the Ratnakūta for the purpose of illustrating the essential nature of correct spiritual practice.	1
In detail, it is taught as follows concluding with the second example of the 'oil-lamp¹238: "In this matter, O Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva who desires instruction through the Dharma discourse, the Maha239 Ramakūṭa, should apply himself properly to the Dharma.	1
And as to what is proper application to the Dharma: namely, it is	1

known as being due to the avoidance of which extremes?	1
Hence he says: V.23 ab The extremes concerning separate- ness and identity, those of the dirthika and śrävaka etc.	0
These fifteen types are differentiated into two extremes; this [the middle way] is to be known as being due to the avoidance of these.	1
In this regard, the views concerning separateness etc.	1
2 243 are extremes considering that there is the figurative use of a cause in regard to the effect because one becomes notionally attached each to his own view.	1
Of these, the notion that the self is something separate from form etc.	1
is one extreme; the notion that it is identical is another extreme.	1
In this respect, those [views] which construe form etc., the aggregates, the sense-fields and the elements as entities to be enjoyed on the part of an eternally existing self are [equivalent to] the extreme view which holds the self to be something separate from form etc.	1
Again, the extreme view that the self is identical to form etc.	1
refers to those [views] which hold the internal formative forces consisting in form etc.	1
to be the self and which construe that which sees, hears and discerns 244 as the self, and external things as belonging to the self.	1
There is one view, expressed in a Sūtra, that holds the individual soul to be [identical with] the physical body and [another view that holds] the individual soul to be one [entity] and the	1
For the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e.	1
for the purpose of avoiding245 the extremes of identity and difference of the self246 in relation to form etc., there is the middle way247, i.e.	1
direct intuition that has for its object only the dharmas.	1
In order to demonstrate this, he says: i.e.	1
that which does not investigate a self, concluding with the non-investigation of a human being.	1

woman, due to the insight that it is only dharmas, he does not see a self; what is meant is: he does not adhere to [the belief in a self].	1
What is the reason that its identity or difference is perceived in relation to form etc.	1
and why is [the self] mentioned by special synonyms 248, such as "sentient being" when it is understood in that sense just by the word "self"?	1
Since all [people] do not understand all synonyms, it is explained through another synonym in order that everyone can understand its meaning.	1
Alterna- tively, it is for the purpose249 of conveying its meaning through different synonyms to those who were distracted at a particular time because when it is mentioned through that description, it is conveyed to others.	1
[3] The notion that form is permanent250 is an extreme embraced by the tirthikas.	1
For, having become attached to imaginary form as an entity, they construe it to be permanent because they are misled through erroneously inverting it as perma- nent.	1
The notion that it is impermanent is an extreme embraced by the śrävakas.	1
This is an extreme because they impute a substantial although imperma- nent nature251 upon form etc.	1
whose essential nature is imaginary.	1
The view that [form] is impermanent is an extreme because it causes one to shrink excessively from samsāra and to fall into an extreme in regard to nirvana.	1
For the purpose of avoiding both of these 252, i.e.	1
for the purpose of avoiding the views [of form] as permanent or impermanent, there is the middle way, i.e.	1
that which does not investigate permanence, nor does it investigate the impermanence, of form etc.	1
Just what is this [middle way]?	1
It is direct intuition free from conceptual differentiation, i.e.	1
that which does not understand form etc.	1
just in relation to [entities of] form etc.	0
or as permanent or impermanent.	1
The word "etc."	1
in the term "form etc.	1
"253 refers to the [four other] aggregates of sensation, ideation, the formative forces and consciousness, the elements of earth, water, fire, wind and space and the sense- fields of sight, hearing, smell, taste, tactility and mind.	1
[4] The notion that the self exists is the extreme of imputation in regard to the personal entity.	1
The [view] which regards the self, which is non-existent in actuality 254 like the son of an infertile woman, as separate or not separate from the	0
nature of an entity, upon the personal entity.	1

But if the self does not exist, how can its description as 'insubstantial' be an extreme of negation?	1
For, there is the negation of just that which exists as a designation257.	0
It is an extreme which negates [the exis- tence] as something insubstantial that is referred to.	1
Moreover, it is a continuum of dharmas wherein the close connection of cause and result is evident.	1
Alternatively, it is a totality in regard to which the designation as god or human [is made].	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e.	1
for the purpose of avoiding the views that the self exists or does not exist; and now, in order to define what is the middle way258, he says: i.e.	1
that which holds the mean position 259 between [the existence of a self and its insubstantiality; but what does that mean consist in?	1
Direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.	1
[5] Having shown that conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is an extreme [and] in order to demonstrate that conceptual differentiation260 in regard to the apprehending subject is also an extreme, he says: the notion that mind is real etc.	1
Alternatively, after showing that imputation and negation in regard to the personal entity is an extreme and in order to show the extremes of imputation and negation in regard to the dharmas, he says: "the notion that mind is real etc.".	1
The notion that mind exists as a reality in exactly that way in which it appears, or, as it is expressed 261. this is the extreme of imputation in regard to the dharmas, because the own-being of mind 262 which is without reality, is imputed as real.	1
The notion that mind is not real is the extreme of negation.	1
The view which regards [mind] as unreal although existent in a nature devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending subject and inexpressible is an extreme of negation because it com- pletely negates the own-being of the dharmas.	1
For the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e.	1
for the purpose of penetrating the insubstantiality of the dharmas which is devoid of imputation and negation, there is the middle way, i.e.	1
that [perspective] wherein there is no mind, nor volition, nor thought, nor consciousness263; the ellipsis is that the notional attachment (to mind etc.]	1

Alternatively, that sphere within which mind does not arise in its nature as a collection 265 of latent impressions accompanied by impurity, nor does volition [arise]	1
[arise], nor does consciousness [arise] as conceptual differentiation - this is described as the middle way.	0
Therein, "mind" refers to the store-consciousness since it is the collection of latent impressions of all dharmas accompanied by impurity.	1
"Volition" refers to the actions of mind and consists in the actions that stimulate mind toward the wholesome, the unwholesome and the neutral.	1
"Thought" refers to defiled mind.	1
"Consciousness" refers to the six groups of consciousness.	1
[6] The notion that the dharmas, such as those that are unwholesome, are [equivalent to] defilement is an extreme in regard to adverse elements; the notion that the wholesome ones etc.	1
are [equivalent to] purification is an extreme in regard to the counteragent.	0
By the word "etc.	1
", the explanations [of dharmas] are referred to that are reprehensible267, not repre- hensible, mundane, supramundane, with and without impurity, conditioned and unconditioned etc.	1
In this respect, the extreme in regard to adverse elements and the extreme in regard to the counteragent refers to the notion that defilement and purifi- cation are exactly [equivalent to] the mode in which the unwholesome and wholesome dharmas appear and are articulated.	1
Therein [the dharmas] are unwholesome because they have the sense of discomfort; they are reprehensible because they cause the mani- festation of bad conduct; they are mundane because they are erroneously inverted; they are accompanied by impurity because they have a propensity towards impurity; they are conditioned because they are produced from causal conditions.	1
However, the wholesome ones etc.	1
should be known as the inverse of these.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these; the term "both of these" refers to the adverse element and the counteragent.	1
Since the middle way is not known in rela- tion to this, he says: that which consists in the non-acceptance, non-utter- ance and non-communication of these two extremes.	1
Of these, non- acceptance 268 refers to the absence of the notional attachment to adverse elements and the counteragent.	1
It is non-utterance because it does not cause others to accept these extremes in regard to adverse elements and the counteragent.	1
It is non-communication	1

[7] Having taught the middle way [which acts as counteragent to the extremes embraced by the tirthikas and śrāvakas and in order to clearly illustrate the middle way [which acts] as counteragent to the extremes pertinent to the bodhisattva, he says: the notion that both the personal entity and the dharmas exist is the extreme of eternalism; the notion that they do not exist is the extreme of annihi- lationism.	1
The notion that they exist at all times is the extreme of eternalism because of the imputation of the individual characteristic; the notion that they do not exist is the extreme of annihilationism because their essential nature is negated, in every respect.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these since it holds a mean position between the two extremes.	1
Some believe that the "mean" in this context is intended as being separate from both extremes.	1
Others main- tain that the "mean" here lies between these two extremes 271 and has the characteristic of both.	1
Having considered [these two views], how [should it be understood]?	1
The extreme of eternalism refers to the notional attachment to the view that an entity that is an object both of knowledge and verbal description, like the imagination of what is unreal or the dharmadhātu, exists substantially and in an ultimate sense - [this is an extreme] because these [entities] do not exist as such.	0
Similarly 272, the view that [an entity] definitely does not exist, like the horns of a hare, is the extreme of annihila- tionism.	0
What is the reason?	1
Because it does exist as a designation.	1
Hence, since it denies [the existence of the latter, it is described as the extreme of annihilationism.	1
Consequently, that which holds the mean position between existence and non-existence has the characteristic of both since it does not exist substantially nor in an ultimate sense and does exist as a designation.	1
[8] With reference to the extreme of imputation in regard to the adverse elements and their counteragent, he says: the notion that nescience consists in the appre- hended object and apprehending subject273 is one extreme; likewise the notion that knowledge, the formative forces and the unconditioned, which is the counteragent to the latter, consists in the apprehended object and apprehending subject, is another extreme.	1
Moreover, because of the reference here to the final member [of the twelve nidäna by the words]: up until old-age and death, consciousness and name/form etc.	1
are also included.	1

craving, grasping, becoming, birth and also old-age and death, consist in the appre- hended object and apprehending subject is also an extreme.	1
Therein, nescience consists in an absence of the knowledge of the [four] truths and the [three] jewels.	1
The formative forces are impure volitions which have meritorious, demeritorious and neutral274 [tendencies] for their own-being because they are the formative influences for the new existence.	1
Similarly, consciousness etc.	1
should be stated in detail in a way that conforms with the explanations [given in the section entitled]: The Characteristic of Defilement¹275.	0
Knowledge refers to direct intuition devoid of impurity.	1
The counteragent to the formative forces refers just to direct intuition that is unconditioned; it is only hence276 and in order to distinguish it from other unconditioned [elements] that he says: "the counteragent to the latter".	1
However, others consider that in this respect the unconditioned is also eightfold277 because of the fact that it possesses non- origination; but the counteragent refers to volition that is without impurity278 because it does not formatively influence the new existence.	1
Alternatively, the notion that the cessation of these consists in the apprehended object and appre-	1
with consciousness and concluding with old-age and death, are referred to.	1
Since it is not known whether sensation is an entity or a cause, he says: it, i.e.	1
name/form, is checked by that...; by what is name/form checked?	0
By the path which is without impurity and which is the counteragent to name/form.	1
Knowledge and nescience which are non-dual do not make a duality, thus, in this context the path is comprised only by direct intuition together with its associated elements.	1
Consequently 279, since [name/form] is checked by this [i.e.	1
the path], there is cessation; but what is the extreme here280?	0
Just the notional attachment to the apprehended object and appre- hending subject.	1
What is the reason?	1
Because the imposition of a non-existing duality occurs in regard to nescience etc.	1
which are non-dual by nature281.	0
Thus, the extremes in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject are twofold according to their differentiation as belonging to the 'black' or the 'white' side.	1
There in, the 'black' side refers to the twelve limbs that consist in becoming, i.e.	1
from nescience up until old-age and death.	1
Likewise, the 'white' side refers to the same twelve modes according to their differentiation as the cessation of	1

Moreover, in this context, it is just the path that is the counteragent to these	1
account of it.	1
For the purpose of avoiding these, i.e.	1
for the purpose of avoid- ing the extremes that consist in the apprehended object and apprehending subject282, the middle way is mentioned, i.e.	0
is referred to.	1
And since the latter283 is not known, he says: both knowledge and nescience are non-dual.	1
How can knowledge and nescience, up until old-age and death and the cessation of the latter, be	1
and apprehending subject on the part of knowledge and nescience etc.	1
However, that absence is because of the fact that nescience etc.	1
is non-dual by nature.	1
Alternatively, since both knowledge and nescience have an imaginary nature, know- ledge and nescience are non-dual since the non-existence of both knowledge and nescience, which have an imaginary nature, is the same.	1
It should be stated similarly for the formative forces, the unconditioned, consciousness and the cessation of the latter, up until old-age and death and its cessation.	1
But what is the middle way in this context?	1
Just this knowledge that, since knowledge and nescience are non-dual284 and do not make a duality 285, the knowledge to be generated is non-existent and the nescience to be checked is non-existent, the formative forces to be relinquished are non-existent and the cessation of the latter which is to be attained is non-existent.	1
The knowledge that this is so is the non-making of duality286 [9] Defilement is threefold.	1
In this respect, moral defilements 287 are described as defilements either because: (a) they cause the defilements of action and rebirth and (b) they are defiled in themselves; alternatively, it is because they cause disturbance to oneself and others.	1
Action is also described as defilement, because: (a) it develops under the influence of moral defilement, (b) it is the cause of rebirth and (c) certain [actions] are morally defiled in themselves.	1
Rebirth too is [described as] defilement because it is both the cause288 of the moral defilement of action and it is the basis of all misfortune289.	1
Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the threefold differentiation of the defilement of moral defilements, he says: the defilement of moral defilement is threefold etc.	1
Of these, (i) false view refers to the five beginning with the false	1

because they are causes of grief etc.	1
and the new existence.	1
However, others say that the causes of passion etc.	1
are: the sense faculties and objects conducive to it, superficial mental attention and the latent impressions of passion etc.	1
that are lodged in the store- consciousness; but they claim that they, as they appear as these [i.e.	1
passion etc.	1
], are the cause of passion etc.	1
(iii) The resolve for a new existence; i.e.	1
the desire for a new existence.	1
The counteragents to these are: (i) emptiness know- ledge etc.	1
Of these, the counteragent to false views is emptiness knowledge; in this context, emptiness knowledge refers to knowledge that has emptiness for its object.	1
The counteragent to the cause of passion etc.	1
is (ii) signless knowledge because it is devoid of all signs.	1
Alternatively, signless knowledge refers to knowledge that has the signless for its object because it has the emptiness of imaginary passion etc.	1
for its object.	1
The counteragent to the resolve for the new existence is non-resolve knowledge.	1
Non-resolve knowledge 290 refers to knowledge that is either devoid of the resolve for the new existence, or else, which has the emptiness of the new existence for its object.	1
The defilement of action refers to the formative influence of virtuous and non-virtuous actions 291.	1
Formative influence refers to the accumulation and actualization of the actions, both virtuous and non-virtuous, which project the new existence.	1
The counteragent to these is knowledge without formative influence.	1
Knowledge without formative influence refers to that know- ledge, on account of which, one's actions do not formatively influence the new existence; and this has thusness for its object.	1
The defilement of rebirth refers to: (i) the birth in a new existence, i.e.	1
the mind at conception; (ii) the aris- ing of the mind and the mental concomitants every moment in one who has been born, i.e.	1
subsequent to conception, up until death 292; and (iii) the continuance of the new existence, i.e.	1
the death state in accompaniment with moral defilement which is followed immediately by the intermediate state293 and following from the latter comes the rebirth state.	1
However, for those who have gained the formless attainments, the rebirth state follows immediately after the death state.	1
The counteragents to these are: (i) non-birth knowledge, (ii) non- production knowledge and (iii) the absence of own-being knowledge.	1
Of these, the non-birth knowledge refers to the knowledge that all dharmas are 'unborn' since they have the nature of imaginative construction; alternatively, it is that which has	1

their non-production on account of this [knowledge].	1
The absence of own-being knowledge refers to the knowledge that the continued existence of an entity 295 is devoid of own-being, because, like the son of an infertile woman, it does not exist.	1
These seven kinds of knowledge beginning with emptiness knowledg are the counter- agents to the seven kinds of adverse elements beginning with false view as have just been described.	1
The removal of these three kinds of defilement consisting in moral defilement, action and rebirth which are differentiated as sevenfold is [equivalent to] purification; 'removal' [has the sense of] relinquishment.	1
How- ever, others believe that purification refers to thusness, the path and nirvana because the resolution of the term [apagama] is as follows: [defilement] departs (apagacchau) in it [i.e.	1
tathată], by means of it [i.e.	0
märga] and there is the departure itself [i.e.	0

ness knowledge etc....; due to the word "etc.	1
", the following are included: empti- ness knowledge, signless knowledge, non-resolve knowledge, knowledge without formative influence, non-birth knowledge, non-production knowledge and absence of own-being knowledge.	1
The dharmas that are the objects of emptiness	1
object of emptiness knowledge, the object of signless knowledge, the object of non- resolve knowledge, the object of knowledge without formative influence296, the object of non-birth knowledge, the object of non-production knowledge and the object of the absence of own-being knowledge all of which are characterized by the perfected [nature].	1
Up to [the dharmas that are the objects of the absence of own-	1
account of these three kinds of defilement; i.e.	1
the dharmas that are the object of emptiness knowledge etc., which are separate from the defilements of moral defile- ment, action and rebirth that were just described, are not caused [to be empty etc.]	1
through emptiness knowledge etc.	1
297 What is the reason that they are not caused [to be empty etc.]?	1
Because they are emptiness etc.	1
by their very nature.	1
What is meant is: they are devoid of the own-being of false view etc.	1
by their very nature.	1
As to why this is so, he says: because the dharmadhātu is undefiled by nature.	0
Hence, since the dharmas that are the object of emptiness knowledge etc.	1
are emptiness etc.	1
by their very nature, they are not caused [to be empty etc.]	1
through emptiness	0

the object of emptiness knowledge which is devoid of, or free from the defilement	1

Thus, the object of signless knowledge which is devoid of the sign of passion etc.	1
is not caused [to be signless] through signless knowledge because the emptiness of the sign of passion etc.	1
is, in itself, signless.	1
The object of non-resolve knowledge is not caused [to be non-resolve] through non-resolve knowledge because the emptiness of resolve is, by its very nature, characterized by non-resolve300.	1
The object of know- ledge without formative influence is not caused [to be devoid of formative influence] through knowledge that is without formative influence because the emptiness of formative influence is, by its very nature, characterized by the absence of formative influence.	1
The object of non-birth knowledge is not caused [to be non-born] through non-birth knowledge because the emptiness of birth is, by its very nature, characterized by non-birth.	1
The object of non-production knowledge 301 is not caused [to be non- produced] through non-production knowledge because the emptiness of the production of the mind and the mental concomitants every moment is, by its very nature, charac- terized by non-production.	1
The object of the absence of own-being knowledge is not caused [to be devoid of own-being] through the absence of own-being knowledge because the emptiness of the new existence is, by its very nature, devoid of own-being.	1
Alternatively, the statement: "...respectively...on account of the three kinds of defile- ment etc.	0
", [can be interpreted as follows]: a particular dharma of the dharmas that are objects of emptiness knowledge etc.	0
which has a connection with the defilements of moral defilement, action and rebirth that are differentiated as sevenfold, i.e.	1
with a particular variety of defilement, is not caused [to be emptiness ] 302 through emptiness knowledge etc.	1
; on the contrary, it is understood (adhigamyate) [to be emptiness].	0
In this respect, emptiness knowledge is connected with defilement that consists in false	1
knowledge is connected with [defilement that consists in the continuance of the new existence.	1
What is the reason that [the object of emptiness knowledge etc.]	1

In this respect, false views are not caused to be empty through emptiness knowledge, because, by their very nature they are characterized by emptiness.	1
The sign of passion etc.	1
is not caused to be signless through signless knowledge303 because the dharmadhatu is signless by its very nature.	1
Likewise up to [the seventh category wherein] the continuance of the new existence is not caused to be devoid of own-being through the absence of own-being knowledge	1

existent; and since this is the case, then, if one imagines at the dharmadhātu	1
He says:	0
which, like space, is undefiled by nature.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding this extreme, i.e.	1
that which does not cause the	1
the perfected nature, to be empty 306, i.e.	1
as devoid of false view etc.	1
which belongs to the other-dependent nature and is adverse to it307 [i.e.	1
the perfected nature] through emptiness in the nature of knowledge 308.	0
On the contrary, the dharmas are already empty of the essential nature of false view which belongs to the imaginary nature, even when knowledge has not arisen.	1
Similarly, [the middle way] does not cause the dharmas to be signless through [the knowledge of] signlessness, [rather] the dharmas are already signless, and so on up to [the seventh category in relation to which the middle way] does not cause the dharmas to be devoid of own-being through [the knowledge of their absence of own-being, [rather] the dharmas are already devoid of own-being.	1
"A perspective such as this, O Kāśyapa, is described as an investigation of the reality of the dharmas.	1
"309 In this way, both the existence of knowledge and the existence of what is adverse to it are revealed310 as being devoid of the imaginary nature; thus, the repudiation of the extremes that consist in imposition and negation is complete.	1
[10] The above [represents] the classification of conceptual differentiation in sequen- tial order; in addition to these there are seven kinds of dual extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1

How so?	1
Hence he says: these are due to imagining that: (a) emptiness is for the destruction of the belief in the existence of the personal entity, or else, (b) insubstantiality is non-existent.	1

Therefore, it is to be accepted necessarily that the personal entity exists or, that insubstantiality does not³11.	1
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the existence312 and non-existence of these two is an extreme.	1
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding these dual extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation in regard to existence and non-existence.	1
personal entity, moreover, emptiness itself is empty etc."	1
- thus is the quotation from the Sūtra³13.	0
In this respect, emptiness is neither for the destruction of the defiled personal entity, nor for the production of a purified314 personal entity for there can be no destruction nor production of the personal entity because it exists just as a designation, like an 'army' etc.	1
Moreover, emptiness itself is empty but it is not [empty] of the personal entity that is imputed through the false view of individuality because the latter is absolutely non-existent.	1
After considering it in this way, the emptiness of the personal entity and the dharmas by way of substantiality is not an ens because it is devoid of the latter; nor is it a non-ens since it consists in the perfected [nature]315.	1
Moreover, in order to illustrate that emptiness does consist in the perfected [nature], he says: the same holds for past emptiness, future emptiness and the emptiness of the present316 because it illustrates the fact that [emptiness] exists as such in all the three times; alternatively, it is because it illustrates the fact that [emptiness] exists as such in the states of the ordinary person, the adept and the one still in training.	0
Of these, the [emptiness of the] past refers to the state of the ordinary person; future [emptiness] refers to the state of the adept; and the [emptiness of the] present refers to the state of the one still in training.	1
And since the emptiness of own-	1

How so?	1
Hence he says: these are on account of imaginative constructions in regard to the object of relinquishment and the [act of] relinquishing which are due to the fear of emptiness.	1
Of these, the object of appeasement is [equivalent to] the object of relinquishment; the [act of] appeasing is [equivalent to] the [act of] relinquishing.	1
After imagining the dharmas to be [equivalent to] objects of relinquishment and [the knowledge of] emptiness to be [equivalent to] the relinquish- ing 320, fear is generated in regard to emptiness; for, how can the three kinds of defile- ment be objects of relinquishment if they are empty by nature?	1
Hence, they, like the personal entity, ought not be objects of relinquishment and consequently, since there can be no relinquishing in the absence of the object of relinquishment, fear is generated	1
[people] are notionally attached to the fact that the dharmas of form and sensation etc.	1
exist substantially in exactly that way in which they are transformed 321 in the nature of consciousness.	1
They fear³22 emptiness due to ignorance³23 of the fact that those [dharmas] of form etc.	1
whose essential nature is imaginary, are, by their very nature, non-existent like the self.	1
Therefore, the example of 'space' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentia- tion.	1
For instance: "[Just as] a certain person who is afraid of space324 may beat his chest and cry out saying: "remove this space!"	1
What do you think, Kãśyapa, would he be able to remove the space?"	1
(Kāśyapa] replies: "Certainly not, O Venerable One."	1
The Venerable One continues: "Similarly, Kaśyapa³25, I would say that those śramanas and brahmans who are fearful in regard to emptiness have met with a severe distraction; and for what reason?	1
Because, O Kaśyapa, they go astray in regard to emptiness itself and are consequently fearful of it".326 This is what is being said: just as one is unable to remove space because it consists in all form, similarly, emptiness cannot be removed since it is established in all dharmas at all times, and emptiness cannot be removed from the state of being established through	1

relinquishment of dharmas and he consequently shows that this is a groundless fear.	1
[12] Conceptual differentiation328 in regard to the object of fear is an extreme and in regard to the dread of that object of fear; it is the fact that conceptual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred to.	1
That, from which fear arises, is described as the object of fear; insofar as one becomes fearful of this, there is dread, i.e.	1
an undesirable result of that [original fear].	1
That which one imaginatively construes in regard to both the object of fear and the dread [of the latter] are the extremes329.	1
How so?	1
Hence he says: these result from fear of imaginary forms etc.	1
and are on account of the dread of suffering.	1
For, naive people, after imagining forms etc.	1
which have an imaginary nature330 as being substantial, then imagine the fear from these [forms etc.]	1
and their undesired result.	1
Consequently, on account of their dread of suffering, they become fearful both of their forms etc.	1
and their signs.	1
The example of the 'painter' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
For instance: "[Just as] a painter, O Kāśyapa, after creating the terrifying figure of a	1
first in abject terror332 of it; similarly, O Kaśyapa, al1333 ordinary naive people, after creating forms, sounds, odours, tastes and tangible things by themselves.	0
dharmas as they are in reality" 334 Moreover, just as the painter, having, through false conceptual differentiation, super- imposed the existence of a real yakṣa upon the terrifying figure of the yakşa that he himself has created, and fearing it, is rendered unconscious, similarly, all ordinary people who are impelled by false conceptual differentiation wander in samsāra on account of their individual conceptual differentiations 335 which are described as their own creations and are in a momentary state because they are not established in homo- geneous groups.	1

afraid of emptiness because he has not gained mastery over emptiness; however, the bodhisattva is defiled by conceptual differentiation in regard to the imaginary dharmas because moral defilement consists in conceptual differentiation.	1
Others believe there is no meaningful distinction between the two, nevertheless, they are verbally expressed as a pair on account of the influence of the two categories.	1
Others again believe that due to his fear of emptiness, the śrävaka fails to understand what is to be understood336; although the bodhisattva's [failure to understand] is due to his fear of the dharmas that are conceptually differentiated.	1
Others believe that the former [example acts] as the counteragent to the [tendency to] cling to the self, whereas the latter [acts] as the counteragent to the [tendency to] cling to the dharmas.	1
[13] Conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is an extreme and in regard to the apprehending subject; it is the fact that concep- tual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred to.	1
How can these apprehended objects of form etc.	1
and their apprehending subjects, i.e.	1
the groups of consciousness which are perceived in terms of individual characteristic and result, have the nature of superimposition337 like the self etc.?	1
It is the imaginative construction of apprehended object and apprehending subject as substantial entities that is intended as an extreme.	1
The example of the 'magician' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentia- tion.	1
For instance: "[Just as], O Kāśyapa, a magician conjures up a magical creation, then that which is created by means of the magical show338 may devour the magician himself; similarly, O Käsyapa, when a bhikṣu who practises spiritual discipline (yogācāra) is mentally attentive339 to any particular objective support³40, everything appears as just a void for him etc".341 How does one thereby avoid342 the two kinds of extreme that consist in the conceptual differentiation of this kind?	1
Hence he says: for, the knowledge of the non- existence of the object is caused by the knowledge of representation- only and that knowledge of the non-existence of the object annuls that very knowledge of representation-only, because if the object is non- existent, its representation343 is not possible; thus these [two] are	1

magician [in the example]; the knowledge of the non-existence of the object functions as the yakşa that is conjured up, for, the knowledge of the non-existence of the object is characterized by the knowledge that it is representation-only.	1
In the same way that [the yakşa] which is conjured up may devour its creator, similarly, the knowledge of the non-existence of the object will 'devour' that very knowledge of the latter as repre- sentation-only, considering that the perception of the object is a representation, because, if the object does not exist, that it is representation-only is not possible.	1
[14] Conceptual differentiation in regard to correctness is an extreme and in regard to falsity; it is the fact that conceptual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred to.	1
In the state that is conducive to pene- tration, both of these conceptually differentiate the investigation of what is real as being dual extremes, i.e.	1
as correct or false.	1
How so?	1
Correctness refers to the dharmas that are without impurity; falsity refers to those that are accompa- nied by impurity.	1
In this respect, if one attaches to the investigation of what is real just in terms of correctness, then it is [only an investigation of the wholesome dharmas that are accompanied by impurity and it would not constitute an investigation of what is real.	1
Again, if [the investigation of what is real is thought to be] characterized by incorrectness, then it is only falsity that is produced like the wholesome [dharmas] that are associated with the three realms of existence344.	1
The example of 'fire coming from two sticks' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes.	1
For instance: "[Just as], O Käsyapa, a fire is generated in dependence upon two sticks and that very [fire] being generated 345 consumes those two sticks, similarly, O Kāśyapa, the noble faculty of wisdom is generated in dependence upon the investigation of what is real and when it has been generated, it consumes that very investigation of what is real".346	1
are devoid of the characteristic of fire and [the fire] that is generated	1
which has the characteristic of correctness, is generated from the inves- tigation of what is real347 which is devoid of the characteristic of correctness348, and [the faculty of wisdom] that is generated annihilates 344 Ms.(82a.2-3): traidhatukatraidhatukapratisamyukta... but Y's reading of traidhätukapratisamyu- kta... is correct.	0

consumes, that very investigation of what is real thus is the meaning.	1
The latter is described as "consumed" it being as if consumed due to precisely the destruction because one observes that it is modified.	1
And even if this investigation of what is real is 350 accompanied by impurity, it is described as the investigation of what is real because it is in conformity with correctness.	1
[15] Conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action is an extreme and in regard to the non-performance of action; it is the fact that conceptual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred to.	1
How so?	1
Hence he says: both imagine direct intuition to involve an act that is preceded by intelligence, or else, as being devoid of efficacy.	0
Having considered: “I will relinquish nescience" if this direct intuition³51	1
activity for the sake of the relinquishment of that [nescience], this is the extreme that consists in conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action.	1
The notion that, because of its momentary nature, the existence of direct intuition is not possible at the time of the performance of action that leads to relinquishment and consequently is not able to relinquish nescience, is the extreme that consists in conceptual differentiation in regard to the non-performance of action.	1
The example of the oil-lamp' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.	1
For instance: "[Just as], O Kaśyapa, when an oil-lamp is lit, pitch-darkness vanishes and by no means, O Kaśyapa, does the oil-lamp have this thought: "I can disperse all pitch-darkness"; on the contrary, pitch-darkness vanishes in dependence upon the oil-lamp.	1
Similarly, O Kaśyapa, when direct intuition arises, nescience vanishes and by no means, O Käsyapa, does direct intuition have this thought: "I can disperse nescience".	1
On the contrary, nescience vanishes in dependence upon direct intuition".352 This is what being said: in the same way that, although a lamp is empty of the performance of action and is devoid of the intention to dispel pitch-darkness, just through the mere presence of the lamp, all darkness³53 vanishes from that place where it is lit354.	1
Similarly, direct intuition that is free from conceptual differentiation is produced in one's mental continuum and nescience vanishes from that mental contin- uum just because of the mere fact that it is present there.	1
There is no [deliberate] act	1

And similarly, because of the absence of the efficacy of the performance of action on the part of direct intuition³55, it dispels adverse elements356 through its mere presence, like the lamp.	1
[16] Conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination is an extreme and in regard to simultaneity; the fact that conceptual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme is understood.	1
How so?	1
Hence he says: if one imagines that the counteragent does not arise...; the extreme that consists in conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination refers to the notion that insofar as the counteragent has not arisen for a period of time in the past, so too will it not arise in the present.	1
Or else, [one imagines] defilement to endure for a long time; i.e.	0
if nescience is only established as the counter correlate to direct intuition, direct intuition does not have the capacity to arise and if it is produced in some way, even so, the removal of nescience is unable to be carried out by means of direct intuition whose nature is momentary because [nescience] has developed over a long period of time, and consequently, there would be simultaneity on the part of defilement and purification.	1
The second example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differen- tiation.	1
For instance: "[Just as], O Kāśyapa, there is an oil-lamp in a house, an abode, or a cottage 357 which has not been lit by anyone for over a thousand years, then if some person were to light that oil-lamp - what do you think, O Kaśyapa, would the pitch-darkness have this thought: "I have accumulated for a thousand years and I shall not depart from here"?"	1
[Kaśyapa] replied: "Indeed not, O Vener- able One, for when the oil-lamp is lit, pitch-darkness does not have the power not to depart - it must necessarily depart from there."	1
The Venerable One then said: "Similarly, O Kāśyapa, although karma and moral defilement have accumulated for hundreds of thousands of aeons, they vanish in an instant on account of an investigation facilitated by proper mental attention ³58.	1
As to the oil-lamp, O Kāśyapa, it is an epithet for the noble faculty of wisdom; the pitch- darkness, O Kāśyapa³59, is an epithet for karma and moral defilement."	1
"360 By means of this simile [the Buddha] refutes [the notions that]: (a) the counteragent does not arise on the grounds that its arising is dependent upon conditions and (b) the	1

Spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes has now been described.	1
Which are the specific and non-specific spiritual practices?	1
V.27 ab The specific and non-specific are to be known in relation to the ten spiritual levels; That perfection which predominates on a particular spiritual level is specific to that [level].	1
When [the bodhisattva] becomes fully accom- plished in every respect in regard to all [the perfections], it is [described as] non-specific.	1
The supremacy in relation to spiritual practice has now been described.	1
[Sthiramati] Y251.4 [1] The specific and non-specific spiritual practices were listed immediately after the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes.	0
Hence, immediately following the explanation of the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes, he asks: which are the specific and non-specific spiritual practices?	1
Hence he says: V.27 ab The specific and non-specific are to be known in relation to the ten spiritual levels;	1
How so?	1
Hence he says: that perfection which predominates on a particular spiritual level etc.	1
A bodhisattva established on a particular bodhisattva level applies himself strenuously to a particular perfection; the latter predominates in com- parison with the other perfections on that bodhisattva level and is described as specific.	1
For example, on the first spiritual level the perfection of generosity pre-	1
same applies [to the other spiritual levels], up until the perfection of direct intuition on the tenth [level].	1
When [the bodhisattva] becomes fully accomplished in regard to all the remaining perfections on each of the spiritual levels362, without distinction, the spiritual practice on these [levels] is described as non-specific; as has been stated: "on the joyous level [i.e.	1
the first level] the perfection of generosity predominates...".	0
And nor does [the bodhisattva] not become fully accomplished in regard to the other [perfections] according to his power and capacity 363.	0
The explana- tions concerning the remaining spiritual levels should similarly be known in accor- dance with the Sutras.	1
The supremacy in relation to spiritual practice has now been described.	1

Supremacy of Objective Support.	1
Which are the supremacies of objective support?	1
V.27 cd & 28 abcd These are considered to consist in: (a) the establishment, (b) the [dharma]dhātu, (c) the probandum, (d) the probans, (e) retention, (f) correct determination, (g) preserva- tion, (h) penetration, (i) diffusion, (j) understanding, (k) meditative calm and (1) the culminating objec- tive support.	0
There are twelve kinds of objective support, namely, (a) the objec- tive support for establishing the designations of the dharmas; (b) the dharmadhatu as objective support; (c) the probandum as objective support; (d) the probans as objective support; (e) the objective support for retention; (f) the objective support for correct determination; (g) the objective support for preservation; (h) the objective support for pene- tration; (i) the objective support for diffusion; (j) the objective support for understanding; (k) the objective support for meditative calm and (1) the culminating objective support.	1
Of these, the first refers to those dharmas that are respectively determined as the perfections etc.	1
The second refers to thusness.	1
The third and fourth refer respectively to [the latter] two again because [the bodhisattva] arrives at an under- standing of the dharmas, such as the perfections, through his penetra- tion of the dharmadhātu.	0
The fifth is the objective support for the knowledge that consists in learning.	1
The sixth [is the objective support for the knowledge that] consists in reflection since [the bodhisattva] retains it after having understood it.	1
The seventh [is the objective support for the knowledge that] consists in meditative development due to its retention [by each bodhisattva), individually.	1
The eighth is [the objective support] on the first spiritual level for the path of vision.	1
The ninth is [the objective support] for the path of meditative development, up until the seventh spiritual level.	1
The tenth is [the objective support] for the mundane and supramundane paths on that same [level] because [the bodhisattva) arrives at the understanding of the Dharma in itsY252.2 various modes 364.	0
The eleventh is [the objective support] on the eighth spiritual level.	1
The twelfth is [the objective support] on the three spiri- tual levels beginning with the ninth.	1
And those [original] first and second [objective supports] receive nominal designations as the respec- tive objective supports pertinent to each state.	1
The objective supports have now been described.	1
[Sthiramati] [1] Since this is the appropriate place for an explanation of supremacy in relation to the	1
support?³66 Hence, in order to define these³67, he says: V.27 a [They are considered to consist in]: (a) the establishment, (b) the [dharma}dhātu etc.	0
There are twelve kinds of objective support, beginning with the objective support for establishing, up until the culminating objective support.	1
These are described as the supremacies in relation to the objective supports 368 because they are pre-eminent in comparison with all the other objective supports; it is just the	1
Of these, the first refers to those dharmas which are [respectively determined] as the perfections etc.	1
; and since these are respectively deter- mined by the Buddhas and bodhisattvas for the purpose of helping sentient beings, they are [equivalent to] the term "establishment".	0
In order to demonstrate just this, the author of the commentary says: the objective support for establishing the	0
designations of the dharmas, such as the perfection of generosity, the factors that contribute to enlightenment and the noble truths etc., i.e.	1
[the dharmas] are established by such [a designation]370; or else, that [i.e.	1
the designation] is [equivalent to the	0
dharmas.	1

with one's direct realization.	1
The second refers to thusness because it is synonymous with 'dharmadhātu'.	1
The third and fourth...; of these, the third refers to the probandum as objective support and the fourth, the probans as objective support;	0
to the probandum as objective support and the second refers to the probans as objective support.	1
He provides the reason in regard to this: since [the bodhisattva] arrives at an understanding of the dharmas, such as the perfections, through his penetration of the dharmadhātu.	0
What is meant is372: they arrive at an understanding of the perfections which are devoid of impurity due to their penetration of the dharmadhātu³73, i.e.	1
firstly, they have the probandum as objective support, and secondly, the probans as objective support.	1
The fifth, the objective support for retention, is for the knowledge that consists in learning 374.	1
The knowledge that consists in learning is described as retention because it holds fast to the dharmas such as the perfections and to the dharmadhātu, upon hearing it [for the first time].	1
The term: "the objective support for retention" (dhāraṇālambanam) is [resolved as]: the objective support that leads to retention (dhāraṇāyā ālambanam); furthermore, it refers to the first and second [objective supports], i.e.	1
(a) the objective support for establishment and (b) the dharmadhātu as objective support.	1
The sixth [is the objective support for knowledge that] consists in reflection because [the bodhisattva] retains it after having understood it.	1
[The bodhisattva) arrives at an understanding by means of [the four kinds of reasoning, i.e.	1
(a) dependence, (b) cause and effect, (c) proof of logical possibility and (d) real nature, due to his retention of the meaning of what is learnt.	1
Correct determination refers to the knowledge that consists in reflection; its objective support is the objective support for correct determination.	1
The seventh is that [of the knowledge] that consists in meditative development; that it is	1
bodhisattva], individually - preservation is due to retention of the meaning [by each bodhisattva], individually.	1
The knowledge that consists in meditative develop- ment is applicable to the entry to the first spiritual level.	1
Furthermore, this relates to the applications of mindfulness, up until the powers, and its objective support is the objective support for preservation.	1
The eighth is [the objective support] for the path of vision on the first spiritual level.	1
This refers to the penetration of the all-pervading nature of the dharmadhātu which is without duality	1

the resistance of: (a) moral defilements that are to be relinquished by [the path of] vision and (b) undefiled nescience which has the meaning of the all-pervading as its object; moreover, this is the path of vision.	1
Its objective support is the objective support for penetration.	1
The ninth is [the objective support] for the path of meditative development, up until the seventh spiritual level.	1
Diffusion refers to the state of existence of the most excellent culminating point and is due to the practice of that same penetration of the dharmadhātu.	1
It consists in the path of meditative development, up until the seventh spiritual level.	1
The objective support for that path of meditative development is [equivalent to the objective support for diffusion.	1
The tenth is that for the mundane and supramundane paths	1
since [the bodhisattva] arrives at the understanding of the Dharma in its various modes.	1
It is an "understanding" (pragama) since, on that same spiritual level, he attains the understanding (adhigama) of the Dharma in its various modes (prakāra)375 by virtue of his freedom from the notional attachment to all376 the modes etc.	1
of the signs of the Dharma such as the Sūtras.	1
The latter is described as the path of meditative development on that same seventh spiritual level.	1
The objective support that pertains to understanding is the objective support for understanding.	1
The eleventh is [the objective support] on the eighth spiritual level; since, on the eighth level, the meditative calm flows377 spontaneously on the part of [the bodhisattva] whose mental attention is devoid of all signs and effort, that same path of meditative development is described as meditative calm378.	1
The objective support that pertains to meditative calm is the objective support for meditative calm.	1
The twelfth is [the objective support] on the three spiritual levels beginning with the ninth, because, on the ninth, he attains the culminating point of direct intu- ition that consists in the analytical knowledges, on the tenth he attains the culminating point of mastery over karma and on the Buddha level he attains the culminating point of the purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable, in its entirety.	1
In this way, because he reaches the culminating point of the purification of both direct intuition and karma on the three spiritual levels beginning with the ninth, the objective support of one who is established on those levels is described as the culmi- nating objective support.	1
However, others believe that the culminating objective support is mentioned in regard to the three spiritual levels 379, after considering the differentiation of the culminating point of the path as weak, middling and strong.	0

D315a.6-7.347 those [original] first and second [objective supports] receive nominal designations as the respective objective supports380 pertinent to each state so extensive are the objective supports, namely381, the objective support for the establishment of the dharmas and the dharmadhātu as objective support.	0
In this respect382, these two objective supports receive particular nominal designations in relation to each state of direct intuition, (for example], the objective support for reten- tion exists in the state of the knowledge that consists in learning because what is learnt is the object of direct intuition consisting in retention, therefore383, retention knowledge is described as retention.	1
The same should be stated [for the other seven objective supports] up until the culminating objective support.	1
On the ninth, tenth and Buddha levels, there is the culminating attainment, i.e.	1
supramundane direct intuition and the mundane [direct intuition] attained subsequently to that.	0
Thus, the objective support pertinent to this is the culminating objective support.	1

(b) The non-rejection of the universal vehicle refers to full attainment in relation to firm conviction.	1
(c) The absence of distraction away to the lesser vehicle refers to full attainment in relation to the generation of the resolve [for enlightenment].	1
(d) The fulfilment of the perfections refers to full attainment in relation to spiritual prac- tice.	1
(e) The generation of the noble path refers to full attainment in relation to the entry into certainty.	1
(f) The development of the roots of the wholesome refers to full attainment in relation to the maturation of sentient beings due to the prolonged exercise.	1
(g) The pliability of mind refers to full attainment in relation to the purification of the field.	1
(h) Non-fixation in samsāra or nirvana refers to full attainment in rela- tion to the acquisition of the prophesies at the irreversible level because [the bodhisattva] does not turn away from samsära or nirvana.	1
(i) The absence of obscuration refers to full attainment in relation to the Buddha-level.	1
(j) The non-interruption of the latter refers to full attainment in relation to the complete exposition of enlightenment.	1
[Sthiramati] Y255.2 [1] Now, in order to correctly determine the supremacy in relation to full attainment whose appropriate place [for exposition] has arrived, he says: which are the full attainments?	1
They are full attainments insofar as they are brought about through particular spiritual practices.	1
They are described as supreme because: (a) they are super- ior to other full attainments and (b) there are no other full attainments that are superior to them.	1
In order to demonstrate them, he says:Y256 Those which consist in: (a) non- defect, (b) non-rejection³84, (c) non- distraction, (d) fulfilment etc.	1
defects in causal conditions and concluding with the complete exposition of enlighten- Of these, the absence of defects in causal conditions refers to full attainment in relation to the spiritual lineage.	1

V.29 ab [2] The non-rejection of the universal vehicle refers to full attainment in relation to firm conviction.	0
If one does not reject the Dharma of the universal vehicle which is characterized by profundity and magnanimity then the growth of firm conviction which has the nature of the maintenance of [the bodhisattva's] determina- tion, ensues.	1
[3] The absence of distraction away to the lesser vehicle refers to full attainment in relation to the generation of the resolve [for enlighten- ment].	1
Although the conditions may exist for a reversal of the resolve for enlighten- ment on the part of one whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated, if³86 his resolve does not stray to the śrävaka vehicle or to the pratyekabuddha vehicle, then his resolve for enlightenment reaches maturity.	1
[4] The fulfilment of the perfections refers to full attainment in relation to spiritual practice.	1
On account of the fulfilment of the perfection of generosity etc.	1
there is growth in the accomplishment of omniscience on the part of those whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated due to the force of the latter [i.e.	1

'free from defect'] (nyāma), like a place sheltered from the wind389, i.e.	0
a region free from impurity.	1
[The term]: 'entry into certainty' (nyāmävakrānti) is [resolved as] entry into certainty (nyāmāyām avakrānti); what is meant is: the latter [i.e.	1
avakrānti, lit.	0
'descent'] is [equivalent to] 'entry' (praveśa)390.	0
Also, as regards the reading: 'entry into certainty' (niyamāvakrānti), the word 'certitude' (niyama) is none other than certainty (niyama), for thus it is said that one for whom the path of vision has arisen is certain [to be born] in a propitious state of existence or nirvana.	1
[6] The development of the roots of the wholesome refers to full attain- ment in relation to the maturation of sentient beings due to the prolonged exercise.	1
The development of the roots of the wholesome refers to the growth of the roots of the wholesome in those who have attained the path of vision due to prolonged exercise or practice on the path of meditative development which is attained subsequently to that [path of vision].	1
Since [the bodhisattva] has the ability to bring beings to maturity on account of that [growth], consequently 391, the development of the roots of the wholesome refers to full attainment in relation to the maturation of beings.	1
However, others believe that the maturation of sentient beings by [the bodhisattva] in this way is fully attained because392 the roots of the wholesome are strengthened393 in the mental continuum of sentient beings owing to prolonged practice	0
purification of the field 395.	0
Since the pliability of mind on the part of those whose roots of the wholesome have increased through meditative development is due to separation from both the signs and the effort that are adverse to the path traversable by just the one [i.e.	1
the Buddha], he shows the Buddha-field [is attained], like crystal etc.	1
according to one's wish, through the influence of pliability 396.	1
Hence, the pliability of mind refers to full attainment in regard to the purification of the field.	1

samsāra or nirvana, because he is not fixed in samsāra or nirvana on account of his mental pliability.	1
Since he possesses the prosperous result of the three perfections beginning with generosity, he is not fixed in nirvana due to his regard for sentient beings.	1
Since he possesses the three perfections beginning with vigour, he is not defiled by the moral defilements of samsāra; therefore, he is not fixed in samsāra.	1
Alternatively, he is not fixed in samsāra nor nirvāṇa for he does not turn away from either of them.	1
In this respect, he does not turn away from samsāra because of his regard for sentient beings for he accepts samsara out of compassion; nor does he turn away from nirvāṇa on account of his wisdom.	1
Thus, since the bodhisattva is fixed neither in samsāra nor nirvana, he remains on the unshakable level which is irre- versible, and [experiences] full attainment in relation to the acquisition of the prophesy of his Buddha[hood].	1
Alternatively, [he experiences] full attainment in relation to both the acquisition of the irreversible level and the acquisition of the prophesy.	1
[9] The absence of obscuration refers to full attainment in relation to the Buddha-level398, because [the bodhisattva experiences] full attainment in relation to the Buddha-level, which incorporates the three Bodies, on account of his relinquish- ment of all obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable together with their latent impressions.	1
Therefore, the absence of obscuration refers to full attainment in relation to the Buddha-level.	1
[10] The non-interruption of the latter refers to full attainment in rela- tion to the complete exposition of enlightenment.	1
There is no interruption to that Buddha's enlightenment due to the force of his universal compassion (which endures] for as long as the world exists.	0
Full attainment in relation to the complete exposition of enlightenment is [equivalent to the demonstration of enlightenment.	1
In this regard, [the Buddha's] dwelling in the Tuşita realm, his descent into the womb, his birth, his enjoyment of sense-pleasures, his departure from home, his performance of difficult deeds, his turning of the Great Wheel of the Dharma and his mahäparinirvāṇa etc.	1
are demonstrated, because the complete exposition of enlightenment is not some- thing separate from these [events].	1
The expression: "the complete exposition of enlight- enment", includes [these] additional [events] also, since it is mentioned just as an example.	1

[Sthiramati] Y258.12 [1] Thus, i.e.	0
since the general meanings of the words herein are complete and in	1
meanings, this is described as: V.30 a treatise that consists in the analysis of the middle;	1
dates the middle way; because this treatise herein elucidates the middle way devoid of the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism.	1
Therefore, this treatise is described as the analysis of the middle what is meant is: it is an exposition and illustration of the middle [way].	1
This is also the analysis of the middle and the extremes; here now he provides the reason: because it elucidates the middle and the two extremes, hence it is described as the analysis of the middle and the extremes.	1
TheY259 middle, in this context, refers to the dharmadhatu which is without duality and the extremes refer to imputation and negation.	1
Alternatively, since it elucidates the	1
thusness; others believe that it is the imagination of the unreal which is without begin- ning and end that is elucidated in this context and is referred to by the words 'middle and extremes'.	1

And it is in relation to what?	1
"The specific and non- specific are [to be known] in relation to the ten spiritual levels" [V.27 The summary meaning of the [various categories of] absence of erroneous inversion: (a) [the bodhisattva] penetrates the sign of tran- quillity and the sign of direct intuition399 through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables.	1
(b) He penetrates the sign of erroneous inversion400 through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to objects.	1
(c) He avoids the underlying cause of erroneous inversion through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activity.	1
(d) He firmly grasps the sign of the latter through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dispersal.	1
(e) He cultivates the path devoid of conceptual differentiation which [acts] as the counteragent to the latter through the absence of erroneous inver- sion in relation to the individual characteristic.	1

How so?	1
It was stated: "...are to be known in relation to the ten spiritual leveis" [V.27 b].Y262 [3] The summary meaning of the [various categories of] absence of erroneous inversion: (a) [the bodhisattva] penetrates 401 the sign of tran- quillity and the sign of direct intuition402 through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables; i.e.	1
he comes to the realization that a combination [of syllables] is devoid of essential nature.	1
(b) He penetrates the sign of erroneous inversion through the absence of erroneous inver- sion in relation to objects; i.e.	1
[he realizes] that the duality is just an appearance.	1
(c) He avoids the underlying cause of erroneous inversion403; i.e.	1
the 'seed' of the notional attachment to the duality which is deposited in the store-consciousness, through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activ- ity.404 (d) He firmly grasps the sign of erroneous inversion owing to the absence of the notional attachment to existent and non-existent [entities] which are like magical creations, through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to	1
tiation, which has the individual characteristic405 of the dharmas for its object and is free from speech, which [acts] as the counteragent to the latter through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual character- istic.	1
(f) He penetrates that which is pure by nature, as being common to all dharmas, through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the universal characteristic.	1
(g) He understands in full the relinquishment non-relinquishment 406 of obscuration to the latter through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to impure and pure mental activity, because the dharmadhatu which is luminous by nature is defiled by adven- titious secondary defilement.	1
(h) He understands defilement and purification in full through the lack of erroneous inversion in relation to their adventitious nature, because it is impossible that defilement and purification can belong to what is luminous by nature, in any other way [i.e.	1
other than as adventitious].	0
(i) He sets forth towards the absence of obscuration407 through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of arrogance on account of the absence of the notional attachment to the personal entity and the dharmas.	1
