for Hannah and EllieABSTRACT
This work contains two main components: (a) an English translation of the
Sanskrit texts comprising the Buddhist Yogācāra philosophical work known as the
Madhyāntavibhaga. It includes the verses (kārikā) of Maitreya/Asanga, commentary
(bhāşya) of Vasubandhu and sub-commentary (fika) of Sthiramati. (b) Text critical
remarks for the establishment of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's commentary based
upon: (i) a photographed copy of the original manuscript, (ii) the Edited Sanskrit text
prepared by S. Yamaguchi and (iii) the Peking and Derge (sde dge) editions of the
canonical blockprints of the Tibetan bsTan hgyur.
The Madhyāntavibhāga contains an exposition of the analysis (vibhāga) of the
middle way (madhya) in relation to the various extreme views (anta). It is arranged in
five chapters: The first chapter, "the defining characteristics" (lakšaņa) provides a
detailed account of both the nature of the phenomenal world and the way that it is
imaginatively constructed (parikalpyate) in consciousness, as well as the Yogācāra
understanding of emptiness (śünyata). Chapter two identifies the main obscurations
(avaraṇa) to enlightenment for the śravaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.
Chapter three provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva) and their intrinsic
relationship with the three natures (svabhāva), i.e the imaginary (parikalpita), the other-
dependent (paratantra) and the perfected (parinişpanna). Chapter four is concerned
with the development of meditative practices (bhāvanā), the various states (avasthā) of
the latter and the results (phala) obtained from those states. Chapter Five extols the
virtues of the universal vehicle (mahāyāna) in comparison to the other vehicles
especially in regard to spiritual practice (pratipatti), objective support (ālambana) and
full attainment (samudāgama).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the people who, in various ways,
made this study possible. Firstly, I wish to thank Professor J. W. de Jong for his
guidance both during my early years as a student of the Sanskrit language and literature
and in the preparation of this work. Without the benefit of his scholarly expertise and
learning the completed work would certainly have been of a much lower standard. I
must also thank my co-supervisor, Dr. Tissa Rajapatirana, whose infinite patience and
skills as a teacher of the Sanskrit and Tibetan languages made it possible for me to
embark upon this project. This work has also benefitted immensely from his
corrections and suggested changes made after reading through the entire work in its
final stages.
I am also in debt to my friend Dr. Michael Comans with whom, as a fellow Ph.D.
student at the A.N.U., I had the good fortune to share an office for three years.
Michael's discipline and dedication to his task is an inspiration to all who work with
him. To Peter Oldmeadow, a true kalyāṇamitra and fellow Ph.D. student, I owe much
for having sparked my initial interest in Indian Religions especially in regard to the
theory and practice of Buddhism. The value of our discussions on the subject over the
years has been immense.
Thanks are also due to the other members of the South and West Asia Centre: Dr.
Luise Hercus, Dr. Richard Barz and Mr. Yogendra Yadav for their friendship and
help. Special thanks are due to the Secretary of the Centre Miss Betty Kat whose good
humour, abundant energy and willingness to be of assistance have eased the difficulties
on countless occasions.
I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Gadjin M. Nagao who kindly
provided me with photocopies of the actual manuscript of the Tika used by Susumu
Yamaguchi in the preparation of his Sanskrit Edition. Thanks are due to Dr. Johannes
Bronkhorst of the Kern Institute who generously provided advice concerning the
proper interpretation of a Sanskrit grammatical term used by Sthiramati. I must
acknowledge the help of Professor Michael Hahn who first suggested that I enquire of
the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project on the expectation that the original
manuscript of the Madhyāntavibhāga-ṭīkā may have been re-discovered there and 1
must also express my gratitude to Dr. Horst Brinkhaus of the Nepal-German
Manuscript Preservation Project who supervised the copying process and ensured that
the copy was despatched to Australia without undue delay.vi
I am indebted to Professor Monika Theil-Horstmann and Dr. Akira Saito for their
generous assistance in the translation of some articles in the German and Japanese
languages, respectively, which were essential to my research. Thanks are due also to
Mr. Yasuo Tsukada for material support given in the true spirit of dāna.
Finally, I wish to thank the Faculty of Asian Studies for the excellent facilities and
opportunity to carry out this research.Contents

Introduction

There are three main reasons for this neglect: (a) The MAV- Tīkä stands virtually
alone as a broad ranging account of early Yogãcãra thought; consequently it is often
not possible to seek help from other parallel texts for a proper understanding of some
of its more complex passages. The Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra (MSA) is closely related
to the MAV and a study of Sthiramati's commentary will undoubtedly shed more light
on the MAV; however, the MSA reflects a more practice oriented doctrine and many
of its ideas are generally at an earlier stage of development. There are other shorter
works in existence that obviously share common doctrinal elements with the MAV,
such as the Dharmadharmatavibhāga and Vasubandhu's Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi;
however, these works are relevant only to specific aspects of the early Yogācāra and
The Madhyântavibhāga (MAV) contains a comprehensive and detailed account of
the philosophical thought of the Yogācāra school of Mahāyāna Buddhism at an early
stage of its development. As a systematic exposition of the Mahayana from the
perspective of the early Yogācāra it is unique; thus its understanding is fundamental to
a proper appreciation of Yogācāra thought.
In the Indian Yogacara tradition the MAV comprises three essential works: (a) the
Kārikā text attributed to Maitreya / Asanga, (b) Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya and (c) the Țīkā
of Sthiramati. Considering that all three of these works have been available for more
than fifty years it is remarkable that they have not been comprehensively studied to-
date. The French translation and annotation of the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi by Louis de
La Vallée Poussin in 1928-292 remains the most authoritative study of the Yogācāra-
vijñaptimātra doctrine. However, this work is not representative of the Yogācāra as a
whole but is heavily influenced by Dharmapala's interpretation of the thought of
Maitreya and Vasubandhu and has fundamental differences from Sthiramati's
interpretations as contained in the MAV-Tīka³. Apart from a flurry of scholarly
activity that coincided with the publication of the Sanskrit Editions of Sthiramati's
Tika in the early 1930's and Vasubandhu's Bhaṣya5 in the 1960's, the MAV has
received only piecemeal attention.

are themselves in need of further study. (b) An additional hindrance to the study of
this school lies in the fact that the precise meaning of many of the words and concepts
employed by Sthiramati is often of quite an enigmatic nature. This is due partly to his
terse commentarial style but also because the reader's familiarity with many of the
subjects discussed is assumed and no attempt is made at further clarification. In
addition, when presenting the alternative views held by other schools Sthiramati never
identifies the particular school intended; presumably because this is also assumed to be
common knowledge. (c) The third factor that has had an inhibiting influence on the
study of the MAV is the quality of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's Tīkä edited and
published by S. Yamaguchi. The manuscript used by Yamaguchi was hand-copied
from a badly damaged original, a large portion of which was reconstructed with the
help of the Tibetan translations. Since it is often impossible to recast much more than
the known technical terms from the Tibetan into Sanskrit with any certainty, such an
enterprise is never entirely satisfactory and this edition stands in need of improvement.
It was the French scholar Sylvain Lévi who first discovered the Sanskrit
manuscript of the MAV-Tīka in Nepal in 1928 and arranged to have a copy prepared
by hand. Inevitably scribal errors were incorporated during the copying process. As
mentioned above, the original manuscript was incomplete with approximately one third
of all the folios missing on the left-hand side. The copied manuscript was then
entrusted to Susumu Yamaguchi who prepared a Sanskrit edition, the first two
chapters of which were published over the next couple of years in various issues of
Otani Gakuhō6. Meanwhile, the MAV-Țikã was discovered for a second time in
Nepal by Guiseppe Tucci, who, with the help of Vidhusekhara Bhaṭṭācārya, also
engaged in the preparation of a Sanskrit edition. Although originally intending to edit
and reconstruct the missing portions of the entire text, they eventually published only
the first chapter in 19327. This is a work of good quality (in devanagarī script) and the
reconstructed sentences are sometimes preferable to those of Yamaguchi's edition. In
1934 S. Yamaguchi published an edition of the complete Sanskrit text in five chapters
(in Romanised form) which includes the portions recast from the Tibetan. Although
this edition of the MAV-ȚIka has many shortcomings, it must be regarded as a
significant and valuable scholarly achievement; this edition is used as the basis of the
present study.

The MAV-Bhäşya then became the focus of scholarly attention with the
publication in 1937 of S. Yamaguchi's edition of Vasubandhu's Bhasya which
included the Tibetan translation and the Chinese translations of Hsüan-tsang and
Paramärtha¹3. In 1953-54 P.W. O'Brien published an English translation of the third
chapter of the Bhāṣya in two issues of Monumenta Nipponica¹4. This is a very
thorough and readable work based on the Tibetan and Chinese translations and
includes abundant references to Sthiramati's Tika (Yamaguchi's ed.) and also to the
LVP Kośa and Siddhi. An important contribution to the study of the MAV was made
in 1964 when Gadjin M. Nagao published a Sanskrit (Romanised) edition of
Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya which incorporates the Karikā text¹5. It was epared from a
manuscript discovered in the Ngor Monastery in Tibet by Rahula Sanskrityāyana in
1934 and is an exceptionally fine work requiring only a few minor corrections. The
publication of this edition now made it possible to revise Yamaguchi's edition of the
Tīkä since the latter contains many quotations from the Bhäsya that were reconstructed

A Japanese translation of the MAV-Tika was published by S. Yamaguchi in
193510,
The following year the great Russian scholar of Buddhism Theodore
Stcherbatsky published an English translation of just the first chapter of the MA V-
Tika. This work which includes a translation of Vasubandhu's Bhãşya from the
Tibetan is based on the Tucci and Bhaṭṭācārya edition of the Tika as well as the Tibetan
translation. As far as the translation is concerned, it is not a very useful work since it
suffers both from Stcherbatsky's somewhat florid and free style as well his many
philosophical misconceptions regarding the Yogacara doctrine. However, his text-
critical remarks and annotations where he often provides a more literal translation are
quite valuable; many are difficult to improve upon and are incorporated in the present
study. At the same time that Stcherbatsky was preparing his translation, the Dutch
scholar David Friedmann was also translating the first chapter of the Tikå based on
Yamaguchi's edition. When he discovered that the Russian scholar was translating the
same work, Friedmann almost abandoned his translation but fortunately was persuaded
by Stcherbatsky himself to complete his study¹2. The result is a good translation,
generally superior to that of Stcherbatsky's and well annotated particularly through its
references to the LVP Kośa and Siddhi; however, no attempt has been made to rectify
the Sanskrit textual problems.

An attempt was made to improve upon Yamaguchi's edition of the Tīkā by the
Indian scholar Ramachandra Pandeya who published a revised edition in 197119
incorporating the Bhãşya and Kärikā text. In the introduction to this work Pandeya
claims that his corrections to Yamaguchi's edition are made on the basis of the Tibetan
translation (Peking Ed.). Pandeya's edition was reviewed by J.W. de Jong20 who
demonstrated that in many instances his emendations appear to be made quite
arbitrarily without recourse to the Tibetan text and for this reason Pandeya's edition has
not been consulted in the present study. In his review, de Jong resolves many of the
textual problems of the second chapter of the Țikä.
In 1982 Thomas A. Kochumuttom published a study of the essential doctrines
from the works of Vasubandhu21 which includes an English translation of the first
chapter of the MAV-Bhāṣya as well as selected parts of the Tika. Although his
translation of the Bhãṣya is generally quite accurate, his translation of the Țika
passages (upon which much of his interpretative comment depends) is based on
Pandeya's edition which, as we have seen, is not completely reliable. It should be
noted that Kochumuttom's understanding of the philosophy of Vasubandhu is
controversial for he argues that it is open to interpretation as a system that embraces
"realistic pluralism". An English translation of the whole MAV-Bhāṣya was included
in a publication by Stephan Anacker in 198422. This is an unsatisfactory work which
abounds with errors and misunderstandings 23
When my own project was first conceived it was envisaged to have three main
components: (a) A translation of the Karika, Bhãşya and Tīkā texts based on Nagao's
and Yamaguchi's respective editions. (b) Text-critical annotations to the Yamaguchi
edition of the Tika with the help of the Sanskrit Bhāṣya and versions of the
Tibetan translation, i.e. the Derge (sde dge) and Peking editions, with the aim of
making a significant contribution towards the establishment of a more reliable Sanskrit

Tīkā text. (c) Time permitting, I also hoped to produce a preliminary exegesis of the
work.
Several months after beginning my study I was fortunate enough to discuss my
research with Professor M. Hahn of the Indologisches Seminar of the University of
Bonn who was visiting the A.N.U. at the time. Following his suggestion I contacted
the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project in Kathmandu, Nepal, on the
chance that the original manuscript of the MAV-Tīkā were listed among their records.
As it turned out, this was in fact the case the Tīkä had indeed been discovered for a
third time and was catalogued and microfilmed in 1970 by that organization. Many
months later I managed to secure a copy of the manuscript which was photographed
from the microfilmed copy. The script of the manuscript is clearly a variety of Nevari
and the reproduction is generally of a very high quality, most characters being quite
legible as can be seen from the samples shown in Appendix I. It soon became obvious
that it was the very manuscript found by Lévi and Tucci more than fifty years earlier
although a little worse for wear. When compared with Yamaguchi's edition, the
lacunae coincide almost exactly; the only differences being caused by further
deterioration along the damaged side of some folios where up to ten characters may be
lost. The first folio (1b) is in a particularly bad state with only a small fragment that
can be read with certainty. Also, two folios are completely absent (31b and 32a
equivalent to Y105.15 to 106.27). The microfilm is kept in the National Archives,
Kathmandu, Nepal, and the details found on the title page are as follows: Manuscript
No. 5 233 vi bauddhadarśana 66; Catalogue: brhat samkşipta sūcipatram; Title:
Madhyāntavibhaga-kārikā; No. of leaves: 85; Size: 56 x 5.5 cm.; Date of filming:
22.9.70; Remarks: palm-leaf - half of the foll. very badly damaged; Reel No. A38/10.
The re-discovery of the original manuscript of the MAV-Țīkâ has thus made it
possible to include new material in this study, material that is particularly relevant to the
establishment of the Sanskrit text. By comparing the original manuscript with the
Yamaguchi edition it has been possible to detect and rectify many mis-readings and
scribal errors that were incorporated into the Yamaguchi edition. This aspect of my
work has been further complemented through the acquisition of a photo-copy of the
actual manuscript used by Yamaguchi which was kindly supplied by Prof. G.M.
Nagao.
As my research progressed it became apparent that there would not be time to carry
out the third component originally envisaged, i.e. the exegesis of the text; rather, the
completed study would be restricted to the translation and textual emendations. In
addition to the textual problems encountered in the Sanskrit Tīkā, the Tibetan
translation is also quite corrupt in many places, thus compounding the difficulties in
establishing the Sanskrit. Although I am now reasonably satisfied that the majority of
the textual problems have been resolved, the completed work cannot not be regarded as1.

definitive or conclusive. The MAV-Tīkā will no doubt yield greater coherence to
future scholars and many of its more enigmatic passages will be translated with more
certainty only after the writings of Sthiramati are understood in greater depth. Suffice
it to say that, although there is considerable scope for improvement through future
research, is intended that this study may serve as the basis for a critical edition of the
Sanskrit text of the Tika and that the translation will be of value to those seeking a
proper understanding of the philosophy and doctrine of the early Yogācāra.

V. Bhaṭṭācārya. Calcutta Oriental Series, No.24, 1932.
Synopsis of the Madhyāntavibhāga.
As its title suggests, the central theme of the Madhyāntavibhāga is the analysis
(vibhāga) of the traditional Buddhist concept of the Middle Way (madhya) in relation
to the various extreme views (anta) recast to accomodate the spiritual perspective of the
Yogācāra. The extremes are normally identified as belonging to two essential
categories, i.e. as the extreme views which lead to imputation (samāropa) or negationxviii
(apavāda) in regard to the existence (bhava) of phenomena in contrast to the way that
they are to be understood in reality. The MAV is arranged in five chapters which deal
with seven main subjects: (a) the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa), (b) the obscurations
(āvaraṇa), (c) the realities (tattva), (d) the meditative development of counteragents
(pratipakṣa-bhāvanā), (e) the various states (avasthā) in the latter, (f) the attainment of
results (phala-präpti) and (g) the supremacy of the [universal] vehicle (yānānuttarya).
Each chapter concludes with an abridged summary (piņdārtha) of contents which,
according to Sthiramati24, is included to enable the student to easily remember both the
contents and sequential order of the subjects explained.
The first chapter, which is possibly the most complex of the five, provides a
detailed account of the essential philosophy of this school. The chapter is divided into
two parts: the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of: (a) the imagination of what is unreal
(abhūta-parikalpa) and (b) emptiness (śūnyatā). Part (a) explores both the nature of the
phenomenal world which is understood in essence as unreal (abhūta), and the way in
which it comes into being or is imaginatively constructed (parikalpa). This part is
divided into nine sections which include explanations of the three natures (tri-
svabhāva), the dynamics of the actualizing consciousnesses (pravṛtti-vijñānāni) and an
extremely detailed re-interpretation of the theory of dependent origination (pratitya-
samutpāda) according to this school. Part (b) defines the correct understanding of
emptiness (śūnyată) in the context of Yogacara thought. This includes a sixteenfold
differentiation of emptiness and contains some of the more enigmatic portions of the
text particularly where emptiness is described as having some sort of positive
ontological value, i.e. the characteristic of emptiness is defined as the existence of a
non-ens. One of the most predominant themes throughout this chapter is the
constantly re-stated significance of the imminent relationship between the conventional
understanding of phenomena (dharma) and their real nature (dharmata).
The second chapter has a more practical orientation than the first insofar as it
examines the main obscurations (āvaraṇa) to enlightenment (bodhi). These are reduced
to two broad categories, namely, the obscuration that consists in moral defilement and
that which consists in the knowable (kleśa-jñeya-āvaraṇa). Firstly, it identifies
obscuration that is common to the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva. It
then concentrates specifically on the bodhisattva by defining the obscurations to his
attainment of (a) the factors that contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya), (b) the
perfections (pāramitā) and (c) the spiritual levels (bhūmi).
The third chapter provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva). These are
identified as the ten main areas where one's understanding of phenomena as they are in
reality (yatha-bhūta) is susceptible to confusion especially in regard to erroneous
inversion (viparyāsa), imputation and negation. Fundamental to the ten realities are the
24 Cf. MAV-Ţika: Y109.5-6 & 164.23ff.xix
three natures (tri-svabhāva), i.e. the imaginary (parikalpita), the other-dependent (para-
tantra) and the perfected (parinișpanna). These three natures collectively comprise the
basic reality (mūla-tattva) which has an intrinsic relationship with the other nine
realities. The latter half of the chapter is devoted solely to the tenth reality, the reality of
the skills (kausalya-tattva), which leads into a detailed explanation of many of the
essential Buddhist doctrines from the Yogācāra point of view. It includes explanation
of the meaning of the five aggregates (pańca-skandha), the elements (dhātu) and the
sense-fields (ayatana).
Chapter four is divided into three sections concerned mainly with description of
various aspects of spiritual practice (pratipatti). These are: (a) the correct practices of
meditative development (bhāvanā) for the generation of the thirty-seven factors that
contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya). The practices are examined through their
modes as counteragents (pratipakṣa) to particular adverse elements (vipakşa). These
factors include the applications of mindfulness (smṛty-upasthāna), the correct exertions
(samyak-prahāna) and the bases of psychic power (ṛddhi-päda). (b) The nine states
(avastha) which define the progress of the bodhisattva engaged in these meditative
practices. (c) The respective results (phala) that are attained by the bodhisattva
stationed in any of these nine states.
The fifth chapter extols the virtues of the universal vehicle (mahāyāna) and indeed
its superiority over the śrävaka-yana and the pratyekabuddha-yāna. This superiority is
explained in relation to three categories: (a) spiritual practice (pratipatti) that is based on
the ten perfections, (b) objective support (alambana) which is twelvefold and (c) full
attainment (samudāgama) which is tenfold. The chapter depends heavily on the
Kāśyapaparivarta section of the Ratnakūṭa for a scriptural basis.
The Authorship of the Madhyäntavibhāga
The Madhyāntavibhäga [-Kärikā) is one of the five treatises which the Mahāyāna
Buddhists traditionally ascribe to Maitreyanatha, the bodhisattva and incumbent
Buddha who resides in the Tuşita Heavens. The legendary accounts in the Tibetan
tradition 25 tell of his materialization in the presence of the Arya Asang: after he had
completed twelve gruelling years of meditative practices. After transporting Asanga to
the Tuşita Heavens, it is said that Maitreya instructed him in the fundamental doctrines
of the Mahāyāna and then passed on to him five important treatises to be taught for the
benefit of sentient beings. They are:

No such confusion exists concerning the historicity of Vasubandhu, the author of
the MAV-Bhäşya; rather, it is over the actual number of Vasubandhus that
contemporary scholars are unable to reach agreement. Traditionally it is believed that
there was only one Vasubandhu, who was the younger brother of Asanga.
Paramārtha ³ 33 reports that he was born in Purușapura (modern day Peshawar) in the
eleventh century after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha and that he was initially allied with
various sarvästivāda schools. During this time he composed his definitive work
illustrating the vaibhășika and sauträntika doctrines in the Abhidharmakośa and
Bhasya. Although originally he was a staunch skeptic of the Mahāyana, is said that
through the efforts of Asanga he eventually became convinced of its theoretical and

The first three of these stand in close relation as works belonging to the early strata
of the Yogacära. The fourth, wherein the tathāgatagarbha doctrine features
prominently, has some links with the Yogăcăra (particularly the MSA) but is classified
as belonging to the Madhyamika-prasangika school by certain Tibetan writers, notably
Tson kha pa26. The fifth is generally regarded as a Madhyamaka work which presents
the bodhisattva path based on the Prajñāpāramitā literature.
For the past sixty years scholars have remained divided over the precise identity of
Maitreyanātha with some, notably U₁27 and Tucci28 preferring to explain him as a
historical personage. Others such as Obermiller29 and Demiéville ³0 argue quite
convincingly that Maitreya is intended as the tutelary inspiration of Asanga and
disclaim the need to read an unwarranted historical facticity into the legendary material.
Obermiller³1 has already drawn attention to the fact that it is in the MA V-Țīkā³2 that
Maitreya is explicitly described as the bodhisattva who has reached the tenth spiritual
level and is separated from Buddhahood by just one birth thus adding credence to his
identification as a tutelary entity.

practical integrity. It is reported that when he made the decision to enter the
Mahāyāna, five hundred of his disciples also made the transition. He is credited with
the authorship of numerous original works and commentaries 34 and his reputation for
excellence in meditative practices and learning was known throughout the North of
India. After the death of Asanga, Vasubandhu became upadhyāya (Abbot) of Nalanda
and Taranātha records that he was responsible for the creation of 654 Dharma centres
in and around Magadha.
The dates of Vasubandhu are problematical. Some scholars argue in favour of the
acceptance of more than one author with this name during the period of the third to
fifth centuries A.D., while others maintain that the available evidence does not allow
for such an interpretation³5. It is a particularly hazy area of study that is based
essentially on attempts to reconcile the Tibetan and Chinese historical accounts and
hence necessarily contains considerable supposition and speculation. Suffice to say
that Vasubandhu, the author of the MAV-Bhäsya, probably lived during the third and
fourth centuries A.D.
Bu-ston describes Sthiramati as a pupil of Vasubandhu who was more learned in
the Abhidharma than his teacher. He is reputed to have joined Vasubandhu at the age
of seven and worked diligently at his studies until becoming proficient in all the five
sciences. According to the Chinese pilgrim I-Tsing36, Sthiramati was at Nalanda for
some years before moving on to Valabhi where he established a monastery and
composed most of his works. He was a prolific writer who wrote sub-commentaries
to most of Vasubandhu's commentaries in addition to numerous other works 37.
Scholars are in rough agreement concerning his dates which can be put approximately
at 500-570 A.D.38

The arrangement of topics and sub-topics under their respective headings follows
Nagao's edition of the Sanskrit Bhāṣya and sometimes differs slightly to the
arrangement of Yamaguchi's edition of the Tika. The Karikä and Bhāṣya text is
translated in bold type and is placed immediately above the relevant Țikä text. When
the Kärikä or Bhãşya is quoted in the Tika, this is also rendered in bold type. The
numbers in the left-hand margin indicate: (a) the page number of the Sanskrit texts
when a page break occurs or (b) the page and line number of the Sanskrit texts at the
beginning of a new topic. The paragraph divisions of the Tīka generally followXxili
Yamaguchi's arrangement although this is occasionally changed for the sake of a more
coherent separation of Sthiramati's argument and discussion.
I have aimed for consistency in the choice of an English term for its Sanskrit or
Tibetan equivalent although this principle is occasionally waived when it is felt that the
context demands a different nuance. For example, svabhāva is usually translated as
"own-being", but when used in the context of the tri-svabhāva doctrine, it is rendered
as "nature" as is the normal practice of most contempory commentators. Due to their
multivalent meaning and cumbersome English equivalents, some Sanskrit words have
not been translated: the word dharina is not translated when its sense as "constituent of
reality", or "ontological category" etc. is intended; when it is used to refer to the
doctrine or teachings of the Buddha, it is rendered as "Dharma". Where the word
karma is used chiefly in the sense of "action" it is translated as such, however, it is not
translated when it is clear that its other more abstract moral connotations (as the fruition
of the actions of the past) are intended. The word jñāna is usually rendered as
"knowledge" and occasionally "cognition" except when it signifies the knowledge that
is free from conceptual discrimination (nirvikalpa), in which case it is translated as
"direct intuition". This latter sense is often clarified by the Tibetan translation which
renders it as ye ses rather than ses pa.
My fundamental principle when translating both Bhāṣya and Țikā has been to take
the Sanskrit text as the reference point. If it reads differently to the Tibetan but
maintains coherence both syntactically and philosophically, its reading is adopted in
preference to the Tibetan and the latter is noted as a variant. In the case of the Tika,
any difference between the manuscript reading and Yamaguchi's text is noted. If a
coherent rendering is not possible from the manuscript, the Tibetan forms the basis of
the translation and an emendation to the Sanskrit is suggested. The translation of the
missing portions of the manuscript is always based on the Tibetan, and an
improvement is annotated where I am unable to agree with Yamaguchi's
reconstruction.Index by Paragraph

Introductory
(Homage to the Buddha)
After honouring the author of this
treatise, the son of the sugata, and
the one who expounded it to us etc.,
I shall strive for a critical exami-
nation of its meaning.
Alternatively, in order to generate reverence towards the author, the expounder, the
Sūtra and the commentary by stating that: (a) the author had undertaken the treatise and
(b) the expounder [had undertaken] the commentary, he says all this: "the author of this
treatise [etc.]". In this respect, (a) by demonstrating what is expressed by the author².
reverence is generated towards the Sutra for the Noble Maitreya is the author of this
treatise in verse form. Since he is separated [from the attainment of Buddhahood] only
by one birth, he has reached the highest perfection of all the bodhisattvas' higher
knowledges, mystical formulae, analytical knowledge, meditative concentration,
masteries³, intellectual receptivity and emancipations. He has also dispelled the obscu-
rations in their entirety on all the bodhisattva levels. (b) Through the correct presen-
tation of the expounder, reverence is generated towards the commentary (of

(Homage to the Noble Mañjuśri - Kumārabhūta)
¹Since pre-eminent people, as a rule, engage in activities after paying homage to
their preceptor and to their tutelary deity, in order to show that he too was a follower in
the course of pre-eminent people, [Vasubandhu] wishing to compose a commentary on
the Madhyântavibhāga Sūtra says: "the author of this treatise etc.", demonstrating that
he has undertaken an analysis of its meaning after paying respect to both the author and
the expounder. What virtue is obtained when this is done? When respect is paid to
one who possesses virtue and is beneficent, merit is accumulated; when merit is accu-
mulated, with little effort one completes one's enterprise which is unafflicted by
impediments and hindrances.
The first folio of the Ms.(1b) is in a particularly bad condition with just occasional words that
can be read with any certainty, hence the translation of this folio is based essentially on the
Tib. (D1896.2 190a.7).

Vasubandhu], for the expounder here is the Noble Asanga. The Venerable Ācārya
Vasubandhu, after receiving the teaching from him, composed the commentary to it.
Reverence is generated towards the commentary because the meaning of the Sutra is
unerringly stated in it because these two, since they possess the highest wisdoms, are
able to understand, retain and explain [it], without erring. In this way reverence arises
towards both the Sutra and the commentary on the part of those who rely on the
authority of individual people. Also, on the part of those who rely on the Dharma,
reverence arises towards both the author and the expounder because after the true
meaning of the Sutra and the commentary has been understood, when a positive deter-
mination occurs, it is brought about through the understanding of the author and the
expounder; but is not accomplished through just speculation and scriptural tradition? -
thus reverence is generated towards the author and the expounder.
This now should be discussed: what is the nature of a treatise and why is it
[described as] a śästra ? A treatise consists in representations/conceptualizations
appearing as groups of names, words, and syllables. Or rather, a treatise consists in
representations appearing as specific words that cause the attainment of supramundane
direct intuition. [Objection]: How can representations be formulated or commented
upon? [Response]: There is no fault here since the hearer's representations arise from
the representations of the author and the expounder. It is a treatise (śästra) because it
is an instruction for novices (sisya-śāsana) ¹0. In order to generate excellence in moral-
ity, meditative concentration and wisdom, an instruction for novices dissuades them
from the actions of body, speech and mind that do not produce the accumulations [of
merit and direct intuition], and induces them [to engage] in actions that produce the
accumulations. Alternatively, it is a treatise because it conforms with the characteristic
of a treatisell. The characteristic of a treatise consists in the fact that, when the teaching
is practised, one relinquishes moral defilements along with their latent impressions and
is also protected from both becoming and the wretched states of existence which are

fearful on account of their manifold sufferings which are intense, continual and long-
lasting. Therefore, it has the characteristic of a treatise (śāstra) because it rules over
(śāsana) the enemy-like moral defilements, and because it protects (trāṇa)13 from
becoming and the wretched states of existence. Moreover, this pair [i.e. 'ruling over'
and 'protecting'] are found in all works of the universal vehicle and in their interpre-
tations but nowhere else hence this [work] is a treatise [śästra]. It is said:
That which rules over the enemy-like moral
defilements in their entirety; which rescues
[beings from the wretched states of exist-
ence and becoming, is a treatise, by virtue
of its authority and protection. These two
are non-existent in any other doctrinal view.
Of this; the term "of this" is a direct reference to the verses of the Madhyānta-
vibhāga śāstra which is a compendium of seven topics and enables the relinquishment
of obscuration that consists both in moral defilement and the knowable, by way of the
triple vehicle since it is firmly fixed in the [author's] heart.
The author refers to the composer. Although this verbal root [n] has the sense
of 'conveying', nevertheless, since it is compounded with the prefix pra, it is to be
understood in the sense of 'effecting' [lit. 'making']¹4, for it is said:
The meaning of a verbal root is forcibly
changed through the addition of a prefix,
just as the sweetness of the waters of the
Ganges [is changed through mixing] with
the waters of the sea. 15
16 The son of the sugata; the sugata refers to one who has excellently gone
(suşthugata) to the nirvana in which [the bodhisattva] is not permanently fixed which
is [free] from the obscurations that consist in moral defilements, together with their
latent impressions, and the obscurations that consist in the knowable. One who has
relinquished the obscurations of all latent impressions, who has the understanding of
all the dharmas, in every respect, for his essential nature, who is the basis of all might,

Alternatively, he is the son of the sugata insofar as he is born in the nature of the
sugata; as has been said in another Sutra: "he is born in the lineage of the tathāgata
because he has obtained the essential qualities of the latter". This being the case, an
entity that is to be known21 in all its aspects appears to a bodhisattva established on the
tenth spiritual level like a myrobalan fruit on the palm of his hand; however it is as
though his eyes were covered by a fine silk veil. But for the Venerable One, the cover-
ing over the eyes is removed as it were this is the difference. By the term "son of the
sugata" in this context [i.e. here sugata means perfectly understood], the perfect under-
standing of reality is indicated on the part of the author of the treatise, and similarly
perfect compassion and perfect wisdom [are indicated] through his authorship of the
treatise without regard for gain and honour.
The expounder; i.e. the agent of exposition. This [term) is connected with the
words "after honouring". Others believe that the term "son of the sugata" also refers to
him. Moreover, he is the Noble Asanga, for this treatise was disclosed and elucidated
to him through the [meditative concentration named] 'stream of dharmas 23 due to the
Noble Maitreya's miraculous power.

whose body ¹7 possesses inconceivable power like the wishfulfilling gem¹8, who is
capable of performing all benefit for all sentient beings effortlessly and who has the
nature of the excellence of direct intuition free from conceptual differentiation - he is
the sugata. His nature consists in the thusness of purity 19. Since his direct intuition
which is free from conceptual differentiation is brought forth20 from the latter, the son
of the sugata is born from, or in, that [thusness of purity].
24 [The word] and has a conjunctive sense or it is a superfluous word, i.e. it is an
expletive. It also implies that he (Vasubandhu) pays respect to the other Buddhas and
bodhisattvas, not only to the author and the expounder. In response to the question as
to whom it is expounded, he replies: to us etc., which means that we etc.' comprise
those of whom we are the first; it is to the latter that "to us etc." refers. Hereby it is
shown that we ourselves have been instructed in a reliable manner25.

After honouring; i.e. after paying respect [to him] as though he were actually
present and positioned nearby. After honouring, i.e. after paying respect with body,
speech and mind. Having paid respect to the author of the treatise and its expounder,
what should you do then? He says:
I shall strive for a critical examination of meaning; i.e. I shall
undertake the effort to critically examine its meaning and to explain its meaning or to
make distinctions between things. And here the locative case26 [in the terms artha-
vivecane etc.] has the sense of purpose; what is meant is: for the purpose of a critical
examination of its meaning.
The 'Body' of the Treatise.
6
In this regard, the 'body' of the treatise is respectively determined
from the beginning.
(a) the characteristic, (b) obscu-
ration, (c) reality, (d) the meditative
development of the counteragent,
(e) the stage therein, (f) the attain-
ment of the result and (g) the
supremacy of the vehicle.
For these seven subjects are expounded in this treatise, namely: (a)
the characteristic, (b) obscuration, (c) reality, (d) the meditative
development of the counteragent, (e) the state in regard to that medi-
tative development of the counteragent, (f) the attainment of the result
and (g) the supremacy of the vehicle which is the seventh subject.
[Sthiramati]
The subjects here [comprise] the 'body' of the treatise because of the state-
ment: these seven subjects are expounded in this treatise 27. Why has this
treatise been composed? (a) In order to generate correct 28 direct intuition devoid of
conceptual differentiation belonging to the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, (b) because
direct intuition that is free from conceptual differentiation is generated on account of the

kalpa is preferred; this term is omitted from the Tib. (cf. D191b.1).Y6
Alternatively, [the treatise is undertaken] in order to remove the faintheartedness of
the bodhisattvas who, in regard to the fivefold objects of knowledge consisting in the
realms of³1: (a) the world sphere, (b) sentient beings. (c) dharmas, (d) moral discipline
and (e) expedients, may believe that these are difficult to discern individually because
of their infinite differentiation; hence he says:
(a) the characteristic, (b) obscu-
ration, (c) reality etc.
In this regard, the 'body' of the treatise is respectively determined
from the beginning 32. "In this regard" [means]: in regard to the critical examination
of the subjects of the treatise, or else, in regard to the treatise [itself]. "From the begin-
ning" [means]: from the very outset. The term "treatise" has already been elucidated 33.
Its 'body' is an abridgement or summary meaning; or it is the 'body' in the sense of a
basis. For, just as the physical body, which has the external and internal sense-fields
for its basis, is described as a 'body', similarly, the subjects upon which a treatise
depends and proceeds form its 'body'; and these subjects are seven, beginning with the
characteristic. By "respectively determined" is meant: 'designated', or, 'explained'³4.

teaching29 of the insubstantiality of the dharmas, and (c) due to the practice of the latter
[the bodhisattva] obtains the complete relinquishment of obscuration consisting in both
the knowable and moral defilement together with their latent impressions. Further-
more, concerning the insubstantiality of the dharmas, this treatise is undertaken in order
to present the insubstantiality of the dharmas as it is in reality by refuting these two
incompatible views: (a) that the non-existence of all dharmas is [equivalent to] the
insubstantiality of the dharmas, and (b) that the non-existence of an internally active
being is [equivalent to the insubstantiality of the dharmas³0
Others believe [the treatise is undertaken] in order to remove both the lack of
insight and wrong insight on the part of those who lack insight or possess wrong
insight in regard to the characteristic and obscuration etc. through the generation of
correct understanding.

[Objection]: is it not so that this 'body' will be discerned just through an understanding
of the treatise and thus its respective determination at the beginning serves no purpose?
[Response]: No, it is not without purpose for the subjects are helpful for novices
because a novice who has an appreciation of the subjects understands the details with
ease when they are being discussed, like a horse galloping without fear on familiar
ground 35, it is not for any other reason. For these seven subjects are
expounded 36 in this treatise. What is meant by this statement is that the 'body' of
the treatise is complete 37. By "these" (is meant] the [subjects] beginning with the char-
acteristic that are listed. "Seven" is their number; it is an enumeration in order to reveal
the total 38. They are subjects (artha) because they are sought (arthyante), i.e. insofar as
they are understood. By "in this treatise" is meant: in [this work) titled the Madhyānta-
vibhāga. By "expounded" is meant: "explained" or "ascertained"39. Namely40; this is
the term that introduces these bjects. The characteristic; it is a characteristic
(lakṣaṇa) insofar as [things) are characterized (lakṣyante) by this. And it is twofold:
the characteristic of defilement and the characteristic of purification. Of these, the char-
acteristic of defilement is ninefold, beginning with: "there is unreal imagination" (I.la),
and concluding with: "because of the seven kinds of unreal imagination" (I.11d). The
characteristic of purification is explained in the remaining half [of the first chapter].
[Objection]: If it is said that it is a characteristic because [something] is characterized
by it, this being the case, the characteristic would be something different from defile-
ment and purification. [Response]: This is not so because the characteristic of some-
thing is none other than its own-being. For example, the element earth has the char-
acteristic of solidity, and the element earth is not something separate from solidity,
Alternatively, it is a characteristic insofar as [something] is characterized as that. For
thus, defilement and purification are characteristics insofar as [something] is charac-
terized as being of the nature of defilement or purification. Or again, the characteristic
of both defilement and purification is a twofold characteristic: the individual character-
istic and the universal characteristic. Obscuration (ävaraṇa) is so-called because it
conceals (avṛṇoti) the wholesome dharmas; or else, it is an obscuration (avaraṇa) since
the wholesome dharmas are concealed (vriyante) by it since it prevents their arising.
Furthermore, these obscurations have fifty-three modes. Reality implies that 'this'

here is none other than 'that'; the state (bhāva = -tva) of 'that' (tar) is 'reality' (tattva);
what is meant is: it is free from erroneous inversion and it has ten modes. The
counteragent is the side that has the relinquishment of the adverse elements for its
aim it is the path; the practice of that is meditative development. The state refers
to the particular [states] of that [path] which arise in a continuous sequence. This has
nineteen modes beginning with the state of the spiritual lineage. The attainment of
the result42; i.e. obtaining the 'fruit'; this has fifteen modes beginning with the karma-
result. The supremacy of the vehicle; it is a vehicle since one travels by it, and
since it is a vehicle and is also supreme, it is described as the supremacy of the vehicle.
Furthermore, it is threefold beginning with the supremacy of spiritual practice. He
states that this is the seventh subject so as to delimit (the exact number of subjects]
and also to [show] their sequential order. Just this many subjects are explained, i.e.
there are none other than these.
Now, this sequence is for conformity with supramundane direct intuition; for thus
the bodhisattva stationed at the spiritual level43 of one who courses in firm conviction
and is established in morality, should firstly become skilled in defilement and purifi-
cation. Then, that particular obscuration to each wholesome dharma should be known
because liberation is not possible without relinquishing it; and one is unable to relin-
quish what has not been discerned 44 since the fault is not seen. Then, that objective
support through which the mind is liberated from a particular obscuration should be
understood as reality 45. After that, the application which destroys that obscuration on
account of that particular objective support is to be known as the meditative develop-
ment of the counteragent. Then, owing to the diminution of the adverse elements and
the increase in the counteragent, the state in regard to that meditative development of
the counteragent should be known as the state of the spiritual lineage etc. Following
from that there is the actual presence of the supramundane dharmas, i.e. the results
which should be known as the result of winning the stream etc. And this whole
[sequential progression] is common to the bodhisattvas and the śrävakas together with
their novices46 as has been stated in a Sutra: "this recluse is trained in the instructions,
conduct, associations and modes of address of the śrävaka, is trained in the instruc-
tions, conduct, associations and modes of address of the pratyekabuddha, is trained in
the instructions, conduct, associations and modes of address of the bodhisattva."
However, since the supremacy of the bodhisattva is not common [to the others),
supremacy is the seventh subject.

However, another (school] says that the characteristic [is explained] at the begin-
ning in order to generate skill in regard to the characteristic of defilement and purifi-
cation. Of these, defilement is [equivalent to] obscuration, and purification is
[equivalent to] a reality; and since the relinquishment of obscuration is due to the
understanding of reality, hence the [subjects of obscuration and reality [follow in
successive order]. After that comes the counteragent together with its associated
elements, i.e. the path, in order to demonstrate the expedients for the relinquishment of
that [obscuration]. The state therein [is then explained] in order to demonstrate the
weak, middling and higher differentiations 47 in relation to the beginning, middle and
end of the path. And since the state brings a corresponding result, the result [is
explained] immediately after that. All these are common to the bodhisattva and the
śrävaka etc., thus the supremacy of the vehicle [is then explained] in order to proclaim
that the universal vehicle is not common [to the śrāvaka etc.].
Others again say that the characteristic is stated at the beginning in order to show
the characteristics of existence and non-existence. When the characteristic is known,
obscuration should be relinquished and reality should be realized, thus, immediately
after that, obscuration and reality [are explained]. The meditative development of the
counteragent [is explained next] since this is the expedient for both the relinquishment
and realization [respectively] of the latter two and the special states are (equivalent to]
the successive degrees of that [meditative development]. And the result is the relin-
quishment caused by the latter. In order to demonstrate that immediately after that
[comes] the supremacy of the vehicle, this sequence [has been explained).
Others now believe 49 that the explanation of the characteristic for the purpose of
relinquishing negation and imputation for one who is confused about the existence or
non-existence of the dharmas. Obscuration is for the purpose of [developing] skill in
regard to obscuration for one whose confusion has been relinquished. Since reality is
obscured by the latter, reality comes immediately after that for the purpose of
[developing] skill in regard to reality. Since there is the relinquishment of obscuration
through meditative development which penetrates reality50, the meditative development
of the counteragent [is explained] immediately after reality. In order to develop skill in
the classification of these [counteragents) the state [is then explained]. And since the
result is constituted by the state, immediately after the state comes the result in order to
generate skill in that. The supremacy of the vehicle is explained at the end because this
whole [sequential progression takes place] owing to the universal vehicle.

The Defining Characteristics
1. The Imagination of What is Unreal.
51
a. The Characteristic of Existence and Non-
Existence.
Therein, concerning the characteristic, he says:
I.1 abcd
There is the imagination of what is
unreal; the duality is not found
therein; but here emptiness is found
and the former is found in the latter.
In this [verse], the imagination of what is unreal refers to the con-
ceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and the apprehending
subject. The duality refers to the apprehended object and the appre-
hending subject. Emptiness is the absence of apprehended object and
apprehending subject on the part of that unreal imagination. When he
says: "and the former is found in the latter", ["the former" refers to the
imagination of what is unreal. Thus, the characteristic of emptiness
which is not erroneously inverted is shown by this quotation5¹: "One
perceives [phenomena] as they are in reality by realizing that where
something is non-existent, it is empty of that, and furthermore one
correctly comprehends [phenomenal as they are in reality by realizing
that what is left as a remainder in this respect does really exist here".
1.2 abcd
11
Therefore all is established as neither
empty nor not empty, because of
existence, non-existence and again
existence; and this is the middle way.
[All] is neither empty of emptiness and unreal imagination, nor not
empty of the duality of the apprehended object and apprehending
subject. "All" refers to both the conditioned [phenomenal which are
called 'the imagination of what is unreal', and the unconditioned
[phenomena] which are called 'emptiness'. The term "is established"
[means] "is explained". Because of the existence of: unreal imagin-

nikaya sutta no. 121); cf. his "What Remains' in Sunyata: A Yogacara Interpretation of

ation; because of the non-existence of: the duality; and because of the
existence of emptiness in the imagination of what is unreal and [the
existence of the imagination of the unreal in the former. Moreover,
this is the middle way. All [phenomenal are neither absolutely empty
nor are they absolutely not empty. Thus, this passage in the
Prajñāpāramitās etc.: "all this is neither empty nor not empty", is in
agreement.

Therein, concerning the characteristic, he says:
I.1 abcd
There is the imagination of what is
unreal; the duality is not found
therein; but here emptiness is found,
and the former is found in the latter.
13
Therein [means] with reference to, or with regard to the characteristic, among the
seven subjects mentioned above, such as the characteristic and obscuration, he says:
"[there is] the imagination of what is unreal"52. Considering that the explanation com-
plies with the way [the subjects] are listed and the characteristic was listed firstly,
hence, the explanation of just that [subject] is undertaken initially rather than the other
[subjects).
[2] Some believe53 that all dharmas are devoid of own-being in every respect, like
horns on a hare, hence, in order to refute their total negation he says: "there is the
imagination of what is unreal"; the ellipsis here is: "by way of own-being".
[Objection]: Is it not so that such a statement is at variance with the Sutras because it is
said in a Sūtra: "all dharmas are empty"? [Response]: There is no contradiction
because: "therein the duality is not found". For the imagination of what is unreal is
described as empty, i.e. as devoid of the essential nature of the apprehended object and
apprehending subject, but not as devoid of own-being in every respect; consequently, it
is not at variance with the Sūtras. [Objection]: If the duality is thus non-existent in
every respect, like horns on a hare, and unreal imagination does exist by way of own-
being in an absolute sense, then emptiness would be non-existent. [Response]: This is
not so because: "but here emptiness is found". For, since this is the very emptiness
which consists in the absence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject in
the imagination of what is unreal, emptiness is not non-existent. If emptiness is free

from the duality and exists in unreal imagination, why is it that we are not [already]
liberated; and if it were something existing, why is it not apprehended?54 order to
remove such a doubt, he says: "and the former is found in the latter"; because the
imagination of what is unreal is found in emptiness too, therefore one is not [already]
liberated. And this is why [emptiness] cannot be perceived, like the clear water
element [cannot be perceived], because it is accompanied by stain.
-
[3] Alternatively, in order to refute that [false] view of those who believe that mind,
the mental concomitants and also form exist substantially55, he says: "there is the
imagination of what is unreal". The latter certainly exists substantially but form does
not exist separately from it; (form] does not exist substantially. What is the reason?
Because: "the duality is not found therein"; for, the imagination of the unreal is not the
apprehending of something nor is it apprehended by anyone. What is
then? It is just
a 'bare' existent devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending subject. For thus,
form and the like are not apprehended externally to consciousness; consciousness
arises in the appearance of form etc., like in dreams etc., and if it has a cause, its arising
in the absence of one is not tenable. Therefore it is devoid of an objective support, just
as in dreams and the like; elsewhere too it is to be concluded that consciousness is pro-
duced in the appearance of the object due to the maturation of an individual 'seed'. The
existence of the apprehending subject is not tenable if the apprehended object does not
exist because, if the apprehended object does not exist, the apprehending subject [too]
does not exist 56. Therefore, form does not exist separately from unreal imagination.
[Objection]: If the apprehended object does not exist, there can be no liberation because
of the absence of an objective support of purity. [Response]: This is not so because:
"but here emptiness is found"; the word "bur" has the sense of "because". For.
emptiness is the objective support of purity57 and since it exists as an absence of the
apprehended object and apprehending subject in the imagination of what is unreal,
liberation is not non-existent. [Objection]: If it exists and is present in unreal imagina-
tion, what is the reason that it is not apprehended? [Response]: It is not apprehended
because it is obscured by unreal imagination, like the stainlessness 58 of space [is not
apprehended] but not because it does not exist. In order to illustrate this point he
says: "and the former is found in the latter".

and the mental concomitants", in agreement with T-Bhasya (L16.9).

[5] Alternatively, there is no characteristic other than that mentioned in regard to
defilement and purification, hence in order to explain the characteristic of defilement
and purification, he says: "there is the imagination of what is unreal". Defilement has
the imagination of what is unreal for its own-being because it is characterized by error.
How should the fact that it is characterized by error be understood? Because: "the
duality is not found therein". It is known to have an essential nature that consists in
error because it manifests in the aspect of the apprehended object and apprehending
subject which do not exist in its own nature. Now in order to examine63 the nature of
purification, he says: "but here emptiness is found"; for the own-being of emptiness is
purification because its own-being consists in the non-existence of the duality. And in
this context, the inclusion of both the path and cessation should be understood because
they are constituted by emptiness. In order to demonstrate that the side of purification
is to be sought from the side of defilement and the individual continuum does not exist
separately 64, he says: "here". The question arises: if the duality does not exist, how can

[4] Alternatively, in order to refute all negation, he says: "there is the imagination of
what is unreal"; considering that it is not entirely non-existent, nor does it have the
nature of an existent since it exists in the nature of the transformation of consciousness.
However, there are those who believe that form etc. exists, by way of own-being, in
exactly that way in which they manifest, i.e. as separate from unreal imagination. With
regard to such [people] and in order to refute imputation in regard to what is unreal 59,
he says: "the duality is not found therein". The intended meaning is that there is just
'bare' unreal imagination. The non-existence of the duality 60 is apprehended by some
as of the nature of annihilation61, like [the absolute non-existence of the son of an
infertile woman. The absence of an internally active being is said to be fequivalent to]
the emptiness of the dharmas by others. Hence, in order to refute the negation of
emptiness, and in order to reveal insubstantiality in reality, he says: "but here emptiness
is found". [Objection]: If emptiness exists in the imagination of what is unreal, then all
living beings would be liberated effortlessly. [Response]: This is not so because: "and
the former is found in the latter"; since there is no liberation in an emptiness that has
not been purified and [emptiness) that has been defiled62 is purified by a mighty effort,
thus there is no liberation without effort.

66
[7] The duality refers to the apprehended object and apprehending
subject; of these, the apprehended object refers to form etc.; the apprehending subject,
to eye consciousness etc. For, emptiness is the absence 67, or devoidedness, of the
apprehended object and apprehending subject on the part of the imagination of
what is unreal, however the imagination of what is unreal itself is not non-existent; just
as a rope is empty of the own-being of a snake 68 because never at any time does it
possess such an own-being, but it is not that a rope69 is empty of own-being. It is the
same in this respect [i.e. unreal imagination is not empty of own-being]. When he
says: "the former is found in the latter", ["the former" refers to] the
imagination of what is unreal; for thus it has been described as not apprehended
because it is defiled by adventitious obscuration, like the [clarity of the] water-element
etc. Thus... "one perceives [phenomenal... by realizing that where
67
68
15
the world be in error if that [emptiness] exists? Hence he says: "and the former is
found in the latter".
69
[6] There the conceptual differentiation65 of the apprehended object and
apprehending subject, just like the aspects etc. of elephants (which are imagined]
in a magical creation that is empty of the aspects of elephants etc.66 It is the imagin-
ation of what is unreal (abhūtaparikalpa) since the duality which is unreal (abhūta)
is imagined (parikalpyate) in it, or by it. By the word "unreal" he demonstrates that
this [phenomenal world] does not exist in the way in which it is imagined, i.e. as the
[dichotomy of] apprehended object and apprehending subject. By the word
"imagination" he demonstrates that the way in which an object is imagined [qua exist-
ent object], it does not exist as such. Thus the characteristic of this [unreal imagin-
ation] is revealed as being quite devoid of the apprehended object and apprehending
subject. What then is it? The mind and the mental concomitants of the past, present
and the future, which consist in cause and result, which pertain to the three realms of
existence, which exist from time immemorial, which end in nirvana and which are in
conformity with samsāra, are, without exception, unreal imagination; but especially it
refers to the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and apprehending
subject. Therein the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object refers to
consciousness with its appearances as objects and sentient beings. The conceptual
differentiation of the apprehending subject refers to the appearances as the self and
n.ental representations.

something 70 is non-existent, it is empty of that. What does not exist in what?
The duality [does not exist] in the imagination of the unreal; consequently, one sees
that the imagination of the unreal is empty of the duality; and furthermore what
is left as a remainder in this respect does really exist here...". Just what
is left as a remainder here? The imagination of the unreal and emptiness since both of
these exist herein, seeing without superimposition and negation, one correctly
comprehends [phenomena] as they are in reality. It is free from superimpo-
sition in this regard because one sees the absence of the duality in the imagination of
the unreal; and it is free from negation because one sees the existence of both the
imagination of the unreal and emptiness. The characteristic of emptiness,
which is not erroneously inverted, is shown...; because of the actual existence
of that which is empty and because of the non-existence therein of that which it is
empty of. If on the one hand all [dharmas] exist or on the other, all were non-existent,
the characteristic of emptiness would not be non-erroneously inverted because this
would lead to the non-existence of emptiness itself. If that which is called 'empty' were
non-existent, emptiness would not be tenable, because real nature (dharmată) is depen-
dent upon something existent, like the impermanence [of what impermanent] etc. If
the duality did exist, emptiness would not exist. [Objection]: If [the non-existence of]
the duality is just like the [absolute non-existence of the hors of a hare?!, how is the
emptiness of that (duality] on the part of the imagination of the unreal possible, for that
the one is empty of the other has (already been seen? For example, a hermitage can be
[empty] of monks72. [Response]: This is not so7³; just as a rope74 or a magical
creation, although non-existent in themselves, appear in the aspect of a snake or as men
etc. and are described as empty of the snake and men etc. in order to check the grasping
of any [entity) there. Similarly, the imagination of the unreal too, which manifests in
the aspect of the apprehended object and apprehending subject which are non-existent
in themselves, is described as empty 75 of the duality in order to induce naive people to
abandon their attachment to such a notion76.

For what reason was this verse composed? In order to show that all conditioned and

ness the intended meaning of the quotation from the Prajñāpäramitās is made
evident79: "All this is neither empty nor not empty". For otherwise 80 there
would be an inconsistency between the former and the latter. Furthermore, [this verse

extremes of that which is absolutely empty on the one hand; and that which is not
empty on the other, Alternatively, it was composed to sum up the refutation of both
negation and imputation. The imagination of what is unreal is conditioned because it
possess a nature82 that is bound to causes and conditions; however, emptiness is
unconditioned because it does not depend on these. "Is established" [means] is
quoted in the Prajñāpāramitās and other works. Because of existence, i.e. of the
imagination of what is unreal that which is conditioned is not empty since it has
the nature of the imagination of the unreal. Because of non-existence, i.e. of the
duality it is empty of the nature of the apprehended object and apprehending subject.
And because of existence, i.e. of emptiness in the imagination of what is
unreal83, considering that that [emptiness] is the real nature of the latter; the imagin-
ation of the unreal is found in emptiness too in the nature of the possessor of that
dharma. Similarly, even what is unconditioned is not empty of the nature of real nature
but is described as a non-existent insofar as it is empty of a nature that consists in the
duality84

This middle way is thus in agreement88 [with the latter]. All refers to the condi-
tioned and unconditioned (dharmas); they are neither absolutely empty, because
of the actual existence of both the imagination of what is unreal and the emptiness of
that, nor are they absolutely not empty, because of the non-existence of the
duality. If all [dharmas] were to exist, or all were non-existent89, these would indeed
be extremes and not the middle way.
b. The Individual Characteristic.
Thus, having stated both the characteristic of existence and the char-
acteristic of non-existence on the part of the imagination of the unreal,
he states the individual characteristic:
I.3 abcd
Consciousness comes into being in
the appearances as objects, sentient
beings, the self and representations,
although its object does not exist.
Due to the non-existence of the
latter, the former too does not exist.
The appearance as object therein refers to that which appears as an
entity of form etc. The appearance as sentient being refers to that
which [appears] as the five sense-faculties within one's own and others'
mental continuum. The appearance as self refers to the defiled mind
because this is associated with delusion about the self etc.
The appear-
ance as representations refers to the six consciousnesses. "Although its
object does not exist" because the appearances as objects and sentient
beings is without aspect, and because the appearances as self and repre-
sentations are false appearances. "Due to the non-existence of the
latter, the former too does not exist" because of the non-existence of
the latter, i.e. the fourfold object to be apprehended, namely, form etc.,
the five sense faculties, mind and the six consciousnesses, the former
too does not exist, i.e. the apprehending consciousness.
I.4 abc

Consequently, it has been proven
that the imagination of what is unreal
pertains to this [consciousness];

because it does not exist as such, nor
is it non-existent in every respect.
1.4 d
Because it does not exist in that way in which it arises as an appear-
ance, nor is it non-existent in every respect because of the production
of 'bare' error. What is the reason then that its definite non-existence is
not accepted? Because...

Liberation is considered as being due
to its extinction.
Otherwise there would be the fault of the negation of defilement and
purification since neither bondage nor liberation could be established.
[Sthiramati]
[1] Thus, having stated both the characteristic of existence and the char-
acteristic of non-existence on the part of the imagination of what is
unreal...; the characteristic of its existence is existence itself since this is characterized
by existence; what is meant is: he demonstrates the existence of the imagination of
what is unreal by this statement: "there is the imagination of what is unreal". Similarly,
the characteristic of its non-existence is non-existence itself since this is characterized
by non-existence. Furthermore, this refers to that which does not exist as the appre-
hended object and apprehending subject; because the duality does ot exist in unreal
imagination therefore it is said that unreal imagination too does not exist in the nature
of the duality. Now he states the individual characteristic. What is the differ-
ence between the characteristic of existence and the individual characteristic? The char-
acteristic of existence is a universal, but the individual characteristic is a particular.
What would be the consequence if the individual characteristic were not stated here?
The 'body' of the imagination of what is unreal would not be mentioned, hence, in
order to clearly illustrate its 'body' it is said:
[2]
I.3 abcd
Consciousness comes into being in
the appearances as objects, sentient
beings, the self and representations,
although its object does not exist.
Due to the non-existence of the
latter, the former too does not exist.
Alternatively, it is not known how the sense faculties, sense-objects and consciousness
are established in relation to that 'bare' imagination of the unreal referred to above as the
existence of just the 'bare' imagination of the unreal devoid of the apprehended objectY17
90
91
92

and apprehending subject 90; thus in order to show that they are established in relation
to that according to their differentiation as the appearances of the imagination of the
unreal, he states the individual characteristic of the imagination of the unreal: "in the
appearances as objects, sentient beings, the self and representations" etc.
[3] Alternatively, by the [words] "there is the imagination of what is unreal", its 'bare'
existence is made known92 but not its own-being; and if the duality is non-existent, the
reason for the notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject
is not discerned. Also it has not been discussed as to why it is recognized that the
duality does not exist, hence in order to clearly illustrate this, he says: "in the appear-
ances as objects, sentient beings, the self and representations". In this regard, the imagi-
nation of the unreal is the own-being of consciousness, and consciousness together
with its associated elements is intended here 93, but it is chiefly consciousness itself that
is referred to. The ground for that notional attachment to the apprehended object and
apprehending subject is the appearances as objects and sentient beings etc.94.
"Although its object does not exist. Due to the non-existence of the latter, the former
too does not exist"- this is the reason why the duality is non-existent. The appearances
as objects and sentient beings therein refers to the store-consciousness together with its
associates; and the latter is definitely undefined because it is the karma-result. The
appearance as the self refers to defiled mind together with its associated elements; and
that is described as obscured and undefined because it is associated with moral defile-
ment. The appearances as mental representations refers to the group of the six begin-
ning with eye-consciousness together with their associates; these are wholesome,
unwholesome and undefined. In this way, these eight consciousnesses, together with
their associated elements, come forth in the appearances as objects, sentient beings, self
and representations in the five respective states of existence, from the store-conscious-
ness which depends upon co-operating conditions and which incorporates the [noble]
truth of the arising (of suffering]. There is a certain 'special transformation' of the
latent impressions of the wholesome, unwholesome and undefined dharmas in the
store-consciousness and through the influence of that, consciousness comes into being

[4] ...As an entity of form etc. [Consciousness) appears in the nature of form,
sound, odour, taste, contact and non-sensibles because it arises in such an aspect. The
appearance as sentient beings refers to that which [appears] as the five
sense faculties within one's own and others' mental continuum96; the term:
"appears" is understood 97. With regard to the five sense faculties, there is the appella-
tion sattva because it is the locus of excessive attachment (sakti); it is sentient being
(sattva) since it is attached (sajjate) by, or to, these [sense faculties]. Because it arises
in such an aspect, consciousness possesses that particular appearance. The appear-
ance as self refers to defiled mind because that is associated with
delusion about self etc.98; because defiled mind is always 99 associated with
delusion about self, the false view of self, the craving for selfi00 and self conceit.
Since these [four] have the self for their objective support it is proper¹01 that the
appearance as the self pertains to defiled mind. The appearance as representa-
tions refer to the six consciousnesses. The appearance as representations
[occurs] on account of the arising of the aspects of those [consciousnesses] through
manifesting in the nature of apprehenders of sense-objects.
[5] "Although its object does not exist", i.e. [the object which arises] in these
four aspects, because the appearances as objects and sentient beings are
without aspect, and because the appearances as self and representations
are false appearances. Since the appearances as objects and sentient beings mani-
fest in the nature of the apprehended object, the reason for the non-existence of the

in mutually differentiated appearances. [Objection]: How does consciousness arise in
the appearance of those [entities] if the objects etc. do not exist, for when there is no
person [present] a post95 does not appear as a person? [Response]: This is not a fault
for naive people are notionally attached to consciousness in the appearance of objects
etc. as objects that exist separately from consciousness, like the 'hair-nets' seen by a
person with impaired eyesight. Therefore, in order to induce them to abandon their
attachment to those [objects etc.] it is said: "this is just consciousness that arises in the
appearances of objects etc. although devoid of objects and sentient beings etc., just as
there is the appearance of 'hair-nets' etc. for those people who have ophthalmia". Thus
it is said that the other-dependent [nature] with its entities of the eight consciousnesses
comprises the imagination of what is unreal.

object is precisely that it is without aspect, because of the impossibility of its being a
false appearance. However, because the other two [i.e. self and representations} mani-
fest in the nature of the apprehending subject, they are not without aspect and the
reason given for the non-existence of the object [in these cases] is precisely that they
consist in false appearances. For the aspect is the mode of the 'taking hold' of the
objective support in the nature of something impermanent etc. and this does not exist in
the [former] two [i.e. objects and sentient beings] because they manifest in the nature
of the apprehended object. Hence, "because it is without aspect" means: because there
is no apprehender. Alternatively, the aspect consists in the correct knowledge of the
objective support and since this is non-existent on the part of the latter [i.e. objects and
sentient beings], they are without aspect because of the non-existence of the objective
support102
[6] [Objection]: If both [objects and sentient beings are without aspect and have
natures that are mutually differentiated, i.e. just as there is form etc. on the one hand
and sight etc. on the other this being so, what is this exceptional essence belonging to
consciousness rather than form etc. and sight etc. which are well known both generally
and exegetically, whence, after rejecting them, consciousness is perceived to have a
nature that is not differentiated from them? [Response]: Because it is impossible that
the object [exists] separately from that [consciousness). This is respectively deter-
mined as follows: consciousness in the appearances of different objects etc. brought
forth from an individual 'seed' each one appropriated 103 by each particular determin-
ation of the mental continuum, although the essential nature of the different objects
does not exist. Thus for example, the pretas see [a river] filled with pus, excrement
and urine etc. guarded on both sides of the river by men with sticks in their hands 104;
however, humans and the like perceive it as filled with pure, clear water and as quite
inoffensive 105. Also, the ascetics, who practice mental attention in regard to impure
things etc., see the ground completely covered by skeletons; and likewise, in regard to
[all the topics of contemplation] such as [the element] 'earth', they see everything
pervaded by earth etc. Moreover, the generation 106 of a consciousness which
possesses a nature that depends upon an object is not tenable without that object, nor
[is the generation of a consciousness tenable] whose aspects are different from the
essential nature of the object. Therefore it is ascertained that it is just consciousness

that is brought forth in all its appearances 107 as objects and sentient beings etc. without
[the existence of such an object.
[7] Both the appearances as the self and representations are false appearances because
they manifest in the aspect of the apprehending subject although the apprehended
object does not exist. Alternatively, the object does not exist in that way in which it is
imaginatively constructed by consciousness; it is a false appearance because it is a false
objective support, just as when sounds etc. [are imagined as the roaring] of tigers etc.
Similarly, it is an established fact that mental representations too are devoid of a nature
that is imaginatively constructed 108 by another representation. Hence the object of the
appearances as the self and representations also does not exist, just like [the objects) of
the appearances as objects and sentient beings109. Because of the non-existence
of the ...object, ...the former too does not exist, i.e. consciousness...; it
is described as consciousness (vijñāna) since it discerns (vijānāti)110. If the appre-
hended object does not exist, the [existence of the discerning agent is not tenable.
Therefore, due to the non-existence of the object, consciousness does not exist as a
discerning agent; but not so [regarding consciousness] in the appearances of objects,
sentient beings, the self and representations, for, if the latter were non-existent it would
result in total non-existence since there can be no explanation for the essential nature of
consciousness apart from this. If its essential nature were different from this how
would [the existence] of that consciousness be tenable? How could one be differen-
tiated from the other?
[8] Thus, because of the non-existence of the apprehended object and the appre-
hending subject and due to the actual existence of consciousness in the appearance of
the latter, that which was asserted previously, i.e. "there is the imagination what is
unreal; the duality is not found therein", has been established. In order to demonstrate
this, he says:
1.4ab
Consequently it has been proven that
the imagination of what is unreal
pertains to this [consciousness];
That the imagination of what is unreal pertains to these four consciousnesses has been
proven. By "consequently", is meant: by reason of what was just stated, i.e. "because
of the non-existence of the object, the former too does not exist." Furthermore, in

order to prove the existence of unreal imagination¹12 and in order to prove the non-
existence of the duality, he says:
1.4c
Because it does not exist as such,
nor is it non-existent in every respect
etc.
Alternatively, by "consequently" is meant: by the reason that will be stated below. In
order to demonstrate just this, he says: "because it does not exist as such, nor is it non-
existent in every respect." Because it does not exist as such and because it is not non-
existent in every respect [consciousness] arises in the appearance of the apprehended
object and apprehending subject. Although, in this regard, there are four modes [of
appearance], there is no apprehending subject because [the first two modes] are with-
out aspect and because [the latter two] are false appearances, respectively.
Furthermore, there is no apprehended object because all [four modes] are devoid of a
nature that is imaginatively constructed113 by another representation. Nor is it non-
existent in every respect because of the production of 'bare' errori14; that
which appears in an aspect, although non-existent in itself115, is described as "error"; it
is like a magical creation. The word "bare" has the sense of the exclusion of what is
additional to it. This is what is being said: because of the actual existence of
consciousness that consists in error, [consciousness] is not non-existent in every
respect.
[9] What then is the reason that the definite non-existence of that
consciousness that consists in error is not accepted, like the non-existence¹16 of the
apprehended object and apprehending subject [is accepted]? If [such a question]
implies that its existence is unable to be imagined by anyone since it transcends the
domain of all consciousnesses, [the answer is] because...
I.4d
Liberation is considered as being due
to its extinction ¹17.
Hence its definite non-existence is not accepted; on the contrary, its existence is
inferred because of its capacity (as a basis] for the sides of defilement and purification.
Otherwise, if its definite non-existence in every respect is accepted, there would be
neither bondage nor liberation 118. If 'bare' error also did not exist, bondage too would

not exist because there would be no defilement. Liberation too would not exist,
considering that it is from a previous state of bondage that one is released.
[10] Alternatively, in order to exclude other interpretations which beg the questions:
"why is [consciousness that consists in error] not considered as existent in that way in
which it manifests 119, or else, as non-existent in every respect? He says: "liberation
considered as being due to its extinction" 120; what is meant is: when that is not com-
pletely extinguished¹21 there is bondage. This is what is being said: 122 otherwise
there would bel23 the fault of the negation of defilement and purifi-
cation 124 since neither bondage nor liberation [could be established]. If
[phenomena] were to exist absolutely in exactly that way in which they appear as the
apprehended object and apprehending subject for [all beings] from cattle upwards¹25,
this being the case, defilement would be eternal and thus there would be no nirvāṇa.
Similarly, if 'bare' error were also non-existent, there would be no defilement, and
purification would be eternal. Thus in both cases, the effort of those who seek libera-
tion would be in vain and consequently, the existence of the imagination of what is
unreal should necessarily be admitted as well as the non-existence of the duality.

exists just the 'bare' imagination of what is unreal devoid of the apprehended object and
apprehending subject. Furthermore, the three natures are taught in other Sutras, hence,
in order to demonstrate that there is no contradiction with other Sütras, their totality is
described here. This is why the author of the commentary says: ...when there is

The perfected nature is the absence of the duality on the part of the imagination of the
unreal because it is unconditioned and because it is perfected on account of being
devoid of change. It is said:
That absolute emptiness of the imaginary
nature on the part of that [other-dependent
nature] is the perfected nature, the sphere of
direct intuition free from conceptual differ-
entiation.
"On account of the object" [means]: owing to the influence of the object; the same is to
be stated with regard to the [other two statements from verse 1.5]: "on account of the
imagination of what is unreal", and "on account of the non-existence of the duality".
[2] The object consists in the imaginary nature130; in this context131 the object
refers to form etc., sight etc., self and representations; and since it is non-existent in the
imagination of the unreal in a nature that is imaginary, being non-existent132, it is
described as the imaginary nature. It is said:
Conceptual differentiation devoid of con-
ceptual differentiation¹ 133 is imagined by
another conceptual differentiation; its nature
here which is imagined by another concep-
tual differentiation, does not exist.
The imagination of what is unreal consists in the other-dependent
nature; it is other-dependent since it depends on, or is produced by, other causes and
conditions but does not exist in itself. The non-existence of the apprehended
object and apprehending subject consists in the perfected nature; it is
described as perfected because it is perfected insofar as it consists in both perfection
devoid of change and perfection devoid of erroneous inversion.
[3] For, in this context, the absence of the duality on the part of the imagination of the
unreal is described as the non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending
subject, but not merely the non-existence of the duality. Thus, it is just the imagination
of the unreal that is other-dependent because it depends upon causes and conditions.
The latter also is imaginary because it manifests in the natures of the apprehended
object and apprehending subject which are non-existent in themselves. The latter is
also perfected because of its absence of the apprehended object and apprehending

entity of the imagination of the unreal that is to be realized, has been shown.
d. The Characteristic of the Expedient for Entry
into the Characteristic of Non-existence.
Now he reveals the characteristic of the expedient for entry into the
characteristic of non-existence in regard to that imagination of what is
unreal.

tion comes into being.
Based upon
non-perception, non-perception

Based upon the perception of representation-only, the non-percep-
tion of the object originates. Based upon the non-perception of the
object, the non-perception of representation-only originates as well. In
this way, one
enters the characteristic of the non-existence of the
apprehended object and apprehending subject.
I.7 ab
1.7 cd
Consequently, it is proven that the
own-being of perception is non-
perception;
Because, in the absence of the object to be perceived, perception is
not tenable.
Therefore, it should be known that
non-perception and perception are
equivalent.
Because perception is not proven to be perception but is described as
perception insofar as it consists in the appearance of an unreal object,
although it has non-perception for its own-being.
134 Tib. is slightly different; cf. Y's fns.3 & 4, p.23.Y23.19

[Sthiramati]
[1] Since the characteristic of non-existence has not been clearly comprehended, the
imagination of what is unreal leads to 135 the defilements of moral defilement, karma
and rebirth. Consequently, in order to clearly comprehend the characteristic of non-
existence, and in order to demonstrate the expedient for that¹36, he says:
Based upon perception etc.
1.6 a
Since it is indicated implicitly within the imagination of the unreal, or rather since it is
the imagination of the unreal, the characteristic of non-existence is that very non-exist-
ence of the apprehended object and apprehending subject the entry into that is
[equivalent to] its understanding. The expedient for the latter is that through which one
enters the characteristic of non-existence. Moreover, this consists in a twofold skill,
i.e. a special basis 137 for the application to penetrate 138 the all-pervading sense of the
dharmadhātu. This verse was articulated in order to indicate [all] this implicitly.
[2] Based upon 139 the perception of representation-only, the non-
perception of the object originates. This absence of an objective support is the
fact of representation-only; [consciousness] 140 arises in the appearance of form etc. due
to the maturation of the individual 'seed' However, since there is no object consisting
in form etc., one thus enters the non-perception of the apprehended object based
upon¹41 the perception of the apprehending subject.
[3] It should be deliberated upon in this way: consciousness 142, whether in the process
of arising, or, already arisen, would depend upon a sense-object. In this respect, to
depend upon a sense-object while in the process of arising is not tenable because
[consciousness] does not [yet] exist when it is in the process of arising. Nor does it
exist when it has already arisen because it arises in the nature of the appearance of a
sense-object; and since there is no other activity143 on the part of consciousness with
the exception of its arising in the nature of the appearance of the sense-object, it is said
that consciousness depends upon the sense-object while performing144 that activity.
[4] Alternatively, if the functioning of the objective support [occurs when conscious-
ness is already present and not when it is in the process of arising, then consciousness
does not arise 145 with the objective support for its causal condition. This hypothesis is

meaningless, for, if there is the 'seizing' of an objective support that exists, that would
annul the theory of momentariness146, and in the absence of an exceptional nature, like
in the latter case, the 'seizing' of the objective support by consciousness is not tenable.
Or else ¹47, it is considered to have an exceptional nature at the time of the 'seizing' of
the objective support even so, due to the observation of an exceptional nature only in
the other case, it is concluded that [consciousness] 'seizes' only the other objective
support that has already arisen.
[5] Another [school] believes that only the object that ceases to exist [from moment to
moment] is the causal condition that is the objective support for consciousness while in
the process of arising and that this is distinguished from the [three] other causal condi-
tions by the fact that it is the cause of consciousness148 in the appearance of individual
aspects. Thereby, either atoms of form etc., or a collection of them, is imagined to be
the objective support although, in both cases, the objective support does not exist
because all consciousnesses arise in the appearances of jars and clothes etc., but not in
the appearances of atoms. Moreover, consciousness appearing as one thing in the
aspect of the object cannot have an objective support which is different 149, since even
sight and the other [sense faculties] would be objective supports. Moreover, one may
believe that an accumulation of atoms forms the objective support but the individual
[atoms] do not this is also a non-argument, for although they may be accumulated
they can only be considered as objective supports individually not as an accumu-
lation. With regard to the latter [view], consciousness 150 does not arise in the indi-
vidual appearances of atoms, for [it arises] in the appearance of an accumulation of
them; therefore the notion] that atoms form an objective support is not possible. Nor
is the objective support a collection of atoms because causality is not possible on the
part of that which has [only] nominal existence, because like the immediately preced-
ing-causal condition etc. 151, the objective support-causal condition is also considered to
be the cause of consciousness. Therefore, it is not possible that something that ceases
to exist [from moment to moment] can be the objective support-causal condition ¹52.
Likewise, if that which has actually ceased to exist forms the objective support¹53, this

being so, then past and the future [time] would be sense-objects and it has been proven
that consciousness is devoid of the sense-object in dreams etc.
[6] Some believe 154 that the consciousness in dreams etc. is not without an objective
support because it has the sign (nimitta) for its objective support. But, the sign is the
reflected image of the object which has the dissociated formative forces for its own-
being, for if the object does not exist in dreams etc., [the existence of its sign is not
tenable, like in the absence of a face etc., its reflection cannot be established 155.
[Response]: Consciousness, whether in the process of arising or already arisen, does
not have the sign for its objective support because both its non-existence and cessation
have already been described. Consciousness itself consists in the reflection of the
object because of the fact that it is an appearance of the object, hence it is not tenable
that the sign has the nature of the dissociated 156 formative forces. Moreover,
consciousness is to be admitted necessarily as possessing the aspect of the object, for if
it were without aspect, one could not determine the apprehended object and appre-
hending subject.
[7] However, others believe that non-resistant [i.e. transparent] matter forms the
objective support in a dream and in the [meditative contemplation] of ascetics upon
impure things etc.; but [the notion that] the latter are non-resistant and belong to the
domain of mind alone is contradicted by the fact that they have colour and shape etc.
Also, non-resistant matter other than mere non-information (avijñapti) is not taught in
the sästras; therefore this is no more than a hypothesis.
[8] Others again consider that the object of past experience forms the sense-object of
consciousness in a dream because there is no perception of the colour blue etc. in
dreams for one who is born blind. [Response]: It is not that one who is blind from
birth does not perceive colour in dreams, rather, because [the object's] conventional
symbol has not been explained to him, he does not know it by name and hence cannot
communicate it to others. Moreover, if it is only what has been experienced [in the
past] that one sees in a dream, then why is it not considered that one who is blind from
birth also does not see colour, for colour certainly was perceived by such a person in
previous lives¹57? Also, it is not that only what is perceived in the present life appears
in a dream, for there no distinction whatever between one who sleeps and one who
is awake in relation to past, future and present experience. Therefore, it is purely
hypothetical to assert that consciousness ¹58 has an object of past experience as its

sense-object in a dream. Moreover, because the past [experience] is non-existent it is
certain that consciousness, although devoid of a sense-object, arises in the appearance
of the object in a dream. Thus, [the notion of] the non-perception of the sense-object is
cultivated because its perception [occurs] as a mental representation-only.
[9] Based upon the non-perception of the object 59, the non-perception
of representation-only originates as well. Just as one enters the non-existence
of the apprehended object¹60 through the force of representation-only, since the imagi-
nary apprehended object does not exist externally to consciousness; similarly, one
understands the non-existence of representation-only too through the force of the non-
existence of the apprehended object. It is not tenable that the apprehending subject
exists if the apprehended object does not exist because the determination of the
subjectivity of that is dependent upon objectivity. In this way, one enters the
characteristic of the non-existence of the apprehended object and appre-
hending subject which have an imaginary nature; however, [the entry into the
characteristic of the non-existence] of the imagination of what is unreal has not been
shown¹61.
[10] What then is the reason that just the non-existence of representation-only was not
determined 162 from the very beginning? [Response]: Because the apprehending
subject is dependent upon the apprehended object when the object to be supported
does not exist one easily enters [the non-existence of representation-only] due to the
destruction of the entity which has the nature of the objective support163. Otherwise
there would be a definite negation 164 of existence because the apprehended object and
apprehending subject would be devoid of the relation of mutual dependence. At the
conclusion of the first immeasurable aeon [the bodhisattva), progressing without inter-
ruption in the accumulations [of merit and direct intuition] enters this level of direct
intuition which transcends the conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object¹65
and apprehending subject. Thus, while cultivating l 166 the non-existence of form etc.
based upon this [doctrine of] representation-only, he realizes the meditative concen-
tration known as the state of heat (ușmagata), together with its peripheral elements

from this [comes the concentration] known as the summit (mürdhan); Immediately
after that comes the concentration known as receptivity to knowledge (kṣãnu) which is
conducive to the non-perception of the apprehender and is due to the non-perception of
the apprehended object in its entirety. Immediately after that, based upon the non-per-
ception of the object, while cultivating167 the non-perception of even representation-
only 168, [the bodhisattva], in accompaniment with wisdom etc., realizes the meditative
concentration known as the highest mundane experience (laukikägryadharma) together
with its peripheral elements. Immediately after that [he attains] the path of vision and it
is only here that he enters the first spiritual level due to his understanding of the all-
pervading dharmadhātu. This is a mental attention directed towards reality; it is not a
mental attention towards firm conviction 169 like the [four] immeasurables are.
[11] In order to demonstrate the fact that perception has non-perception for its own-
being, he says:
1.7 ab
33
Consequently, it is proven that the
own-being of perception is non-
perception;
[12]
1.7 cd
Alternatively, that which was previously asserted, that the duality does not exist in the
imagination of what is unreal, has been proven because it is introspectively knowable
in this aspect. It is in order to demonstrate this that he says: "consequently, it is proven
that the own-being of perception is non-perception". Consequently, i.e. because
there can be no perception if there is no object to be perceived 170. The term 'perception'
could be construed as any one of: (a) a state, (b) an agent, or (c) an instrument;
however this trio is not tenable due to the non-existence of an objective referent171
(karma) - "consequently, it is proven that the own-being of perception is non-percep-
tion". This is why the author of the commentary says: because, in the absence of
the object to be perceived, perception is not tenable.
Therefore, it should be known that
non-perception and perception are
equivalent.
Since perception has non-perception for its own-being, therefore they are the same; i.e.
the fact that they are equivalent should be known because there is no difference insofar
as there is neither the non-perception of the object nor is there perception consisting in
representation-only. In order to remove mutual contradiction between the words
'perception' and 'non-perception', he says: ...but is described as perception

insofar as it consists in the appearance of an unreal object; but since
nothing is perceived by that [perception] because of the absence of the object, hence,
there is no contradiction in an absolute sense because he says: ...although having
non-perception for its own-being172.
[13] Others say that on the one hand there is the perception of the object173 by naive
people, although there is no object, and on the other hand there is the non-perception of
the object by the Noble Ones; both of these should be known to be the same because
their characteristics are equivalent, like in the [perception and] non-perception of an
erroneous snake. This is why he says: "...but is described as perception insofar as it
consists in the appearance of an unreal object, although having non-perception for its
own-being 174", like in the statement about the non-perception of an erroneous snake.
[14] Others again say that on the one hand there is the perception of the apprehending
subject by naive people; and on the other hand there is the non-perception of the appre-
hending subject by the Noble Ones, because of the absence of the object. Although in
the two cases both perception and non-perception should be known to be the same
because there is no difference insofar as there is no apprehender if there is no appre-
hended object. This is why he says: "...insofar as it consists in the appearance of an
unreal object".
[15] However, others believe that in order to counteract imputation and negation he
says: "therefore, it should be known that non-perception and perception are equiva-
lent", i.e. because of the absence of the object and since perception175 does not have the
essential nature of perception, it is described as not having such an essential nature.
[Response]: [The notion] that perception has perception for its essential nature is not
excluded 176, nor is it interpolated that it has non-perception for its essential nature. 177
What is it then? Both of them are the same owing to the absence of conceptual differ-
entiation. Therefore, regardless of imputation and negation, the fact that there is intro-
spective equality on the part of both non-perception and perception should be known.

concomitants that pertain to the three

[Sthiramati]
Y29.14 [1] He states the characteristic of the differentiation. There are various
modes of differentiation of the imagination of the unreal as being of the nature of ¹81 the
realms of sense-desire, form and formlessness. Since the differentiation itself is the
characteristic, it is the characteristic of the differentiation [i.e. the term prabheda-
lakṣaṇam is a karmadhāraya compound] because the imagination of the unreal is char-
acterized by this differentiation ¹82. What is the reason that the characteristic of the
differentiation is declared? Because the (existence of the] realms of sense-desire and
form is not tenable if there is just the imagination of what is unreal. [If] the differen-
tiation of Noble Ones and ordinary people etc. is not made according to the differen-
tiation183 of realms of existence as the result of the differences in the adverse elements
and their counteragents, there would be a great calamity on the part of the teachings;
[hence], in order to dispel such a fear, the characteristic of the differentiation is stated.

[2] Alternatively, some believe that the imagination of what is unreal is found only
where184 there is conjecture and deliberation and not otherwise; hence, in order to reject
such a [notion], the characteristic of the differentiation is mentioned.
1.8 ab
The imagination of what is unreal
consists in the mind and the mental
concomitants that pertain to the three
realms of existence.
But not just where there is conjecture and deliberation. Just as form refers to the
primary 185 and secondary elementary matter; similarly, the imagination of what is
unreal also refers to both mind and the mental concomitants and not just to mind alone.
Moreover, these are the own-being of the three realms of existence, i.e. they pertain to
the three realms according to their differentiation!!
186 among the spheres of
sense-desire, form and formlessness. The realm of sense-desire therein refers
to the twenty 187 modes [of existence] in the aspects of the narakas etc. which manifest
from that unreal imagination. The realm of form refers to the seventeen modes [of
existence] in the aspects of the brahmakãyika etc. The formless realm refers to the four
modes [of existence] in the aspects of the ākäśānantyāyatana etc.
[3] However, another says that the realm of sense-desire 188 refers to those who belong
to the sphere of sense-desire189, i.e. whose passion for sense-desire has not been relin-
quished and whose notions about form have not been abrogated. The realm of form
refers to those who belong to the sphere of form190, i.e. whose passion for sense-
desire has been relinquished and whose notions about form have not been abrogated.
The formless realm 191 refers to those who belong to the sphere of formlessness 192, i.e.
whose passion for sense-desire has been relinquished and whose notions about form
have been abrogated 193.
[4] Others believe that the realm of sense-desire refers to those with a propensity for
the passion of sense-desire, the realm of form refers to those with a propensity for the
passion of form and the formless realm refers to those with a propensity for the
passion of formlessness.

[5] Others believe that the realm of sense-desire refers to those who are constantly
distracted and have become the basis of [special] sorts of mental dissatisfaction. The
realm of form refers to those who are meditatively composed and whose modes of
mental dissatisfaction have been dispelled. The formless realm refers to those who are
meditatively composed and whose modes of pleasure and dissatisfaction have been
relinquished.
[6] Others again believe that the realm of sense-desire refers to those who have not
relinquished odours and tastes and their appearances in consciousness. The realm of
form refers to those who have relinquished both odours and tastes and their appear-
ances in consciousness. The formless realm refers to those who have relinquished the
appearances of the fifteen elements.
[7] Which is most relevant among all these explanations? It is only necessary that
what was described in the first explanation be mentioned since the [subsequent}
explanations are only correlative to it. This is a further reference to the imagination of
what is unreal in the chapter on unreal imagination because it was interrupted by [the
explanation of non-perception.

f. The Characteristic of its Synonyms.
He states the characteristic of the synonyms:
1.8 cd
Vision in regard to the object con-
sists in consciousness, but in regard
to its particulars, it consists in the
mental concomitants.
195
Therein, vision in regard to the object alone consists in conscious-
ness; vision in regard to the particulars of the object consists in the
mental concomitants, such as sensation.
[Sthiramati]
[1] He states the characteristic of the synonyms194. By demonstrating the
particulars as belonging to the mind and the mental concomitants 195, he states the char-
acteristic of the synonyms of the imagination of what is unreal. How so? Because the
mind and the mental concomitants manifest as imaginative constructions in regard to
194 Read: paryayalakṣaṇam ca khyāpayatīti in place of paryayalakṣaṇam ceti; Tib, mam grans kyi
mtshan ñid kyań ston te (D204a.6). Cf. Bhäşya N20.17.
Read: cittacaittaviseșapradarśanena in place of cittacaittanam prabhedam pradarsayitvä; Tib. sems
dan sems las byun ba mams kyi bye brag rab tu bstan pas (D204a.6).Y32
both the own-being and the particular of an unreal¹96 entity that is to be imaginatively
constructed. Since the vision197 of an object's essential nature and particulars consists
in both the mental concomitants and unreal imagination they are included as synonyms,
however, the particular does not exist in the object.
[2] Therein, the vision in regard to the object alone198 consists in con-
sciousness. The word 'alone' is for the purpose of excluding the particulars 199; what
is meant is: the perception of just the essential nature of an entity the particulars are
not 'seized'. Vision in regard to the particulars of the object200 consists in
the mental concomitants, such as sensation; because they function with regard
to that [i.e. the object]201 in various particular forms. In this regard, the particulars of
joyfulness or sorrow can pertain to an entity and the 'seizing' of the condition of well-
being etc. belonging to that is 'sensation' (vedana). The particular of an object is the
sign202 which consists in a conventional expression, such as 'man' or 'woman' and its
apprehension is 'ideation' (samjña). The other respective [mental concomitants) should
also be construed in this way. Thus these203 are associated by having the same nature
in regard to (a) basis, (b) objective support, (c) time and (d) substance, but not by
having the same nature in regard to aspect too, because it would be non-distinguishable
from consciousness.
[3] Some [schools] understand that it is just the special modes of mind (cittaviseșa)
that are intended as the mental concomitants in this context and that same conscious-
ness arises in variegated appearances, like the eyes on a peacock's tail, in forms etc. that
are similar204. [Objection]: How can it be both singular and variegated since, with
regard to a singular entity 205, the world does not accept a variety of [incompatible]206
characteristics? Otherwise it would be said that a singular entity has a manifold own-
being. [Response]: This fault would apply if the own-being of a dharma were per-
fected, but this fault does not relate to 'bare' error because of the statement: "because it
does not exist as such, nor is it non-existent in every respect"; (I.4 c). [Objection]:
This is not so because it contradicts this statement from a Sutra: "these dharmas known
as sensation (vedanā), ideation (samjñā), mind (citta) and consciousness (vijñāna) are
mixed together they are not discrete; and close-contact (samsarga) indeed belongs to

g. The Actualizing Characteristic.
Next he states the actualizing characteristic:
1.9 abcd
207
The first is consciousness as causal
condition; the second pertains to
sense-experience; the mental con-
comitants therein are sense-experi-
ence, discrimination and stimulation.
Consciousness as causal condition is the store-consciousness since
Actual con-
it is the causal condition for the other consciousnesses.
sciousness, which pertains to sense-experience, has the latter for its
causal condition. Sense-experience refers to sensation. Discrimination
refers to ideation. The stimulations refer to the formative forces of
consciousness volition and mental attention etc.
[Sthiramati]
Y32.10 [1] In order to demonstrate that when there is the 'bare' imagination of the unreal and
nothing else, its differentiation as cause and result is not discerned, [hence] he states
the actualizing characteristic. It is a characteristic since the imagination of the
unreal [is characterized] as cause and result on account of this. [Since] the actualizing
itself is the characteristic, it is the actualizing characteristic [i.e. the term pravṛtti-
lakṣaṇam is a karmadhāraya compound). Furthermore, this actualization209 is twofold:
(a) the actualization as a regular succession of momentary instants under the influence
of which there is the defilement of sense-experience in the present lifetime and (b) the
actualization as another rebirth under the influence of which there is the defilement of
moral defilement, karma and rebirth, in the future. The actualization as a regular
succession of momentary instants in this context is described as the actualizing charac-
teristic. The actualization as another rebirth will be stated as the characteristic of
defilement [in the next section].
Tib. omits na visamsrsta from the preceding sentence and reads instead: 'dres pa żes bya ba ni
yod pa mams cig car phrad par gyur ba la bya'o (D205a.1): "That which is mixed together is
the simultaneous close contact of entities".
208 ajñāpakam; Tib, khuńs su mi ruń (D204b.7).
209 Ms.(9b.3): pravŢttiḥ, disregard Y's fn.4 p.32.Y33
1.9 a
The first is consciousness as causal
condition etc.
In the above, "the first" refers to the store-consciousness210. Since it is the cause, i.e.
the basic causal condition (hetupratyaya), of the remaining seven consciousnesses, it is
consciousness as causal condition.
1.9 b
The second pertains to sense-
experience.
The word "consciousness" remains in force [from the preceding sentence]. The
ellipsis is: it is the result of the latter [i.e. the store-consciousness]; moreover, it is
sevenfold. The actual consciousness pertains to sense-experience because it has sense-
experiencing for its purpose.
1.9 cd
213
214
40
The mental concomitants therein are
sense-experience, discrimination and
stimulation.211
It is the fact that the mental concomitants therein, i.e. in consciousness, are also the
result of that [store-consciousness) that is referred to because they are [constituents of]
consciousness and because they share its attainments and protection as one.
[2] Consciousness as causal condition is the store-consciousness since
it is the basic causal condition for the other consciousnesses212. It is
[described as] a store-house (ālaya) since, in its mode as result, all impure213 dharmas
are collected (aliyante) there, and, in its mode as cause, it collects in them. It is con-
sciousness because it causes the representation of the world of sentient beings and
inanimate things through appearing as such; moreover, because it consists exclusively
in the karma result, it is undefined. It is consciousness as causal condition since it is
the basic causal condition for both the 'seeds' of all impure dharmas that follow in
consequence of it214 and for the other actual consciousnesses. Actual conscious-
ness, which pertains to sense-experience, has the latter for its causal
condition; what is meant is: since it arises (pratyeti) from that store-consciousness, it
is produced with the latter for its causal condition (tatpratyaya). How does arise?
The actual consciousness, while in the process of manifesting from the store-
consciousness, fosters in that store-consciousness a 'seed' which is the progenitor of an
actual consciousness which has not yet arisen and which is of the same genre. [Then]

an actual consciousness of the same genre is produced again from that matured 'seed'
which has undergone a special transformation215. Thus, that actual consciousness216
has that [store-consciousness] for its causal condition²17.
[3] [Objection]: Is it not so that218 the store-consciousness also pertains to sense-
experience, and the actual consciousness can be [construed as the consciousness as
causal condition because [the store-consciousness] is the basis of the sense-experience
of non-painful and non-pleasurable sensations and also because the latent impressions
are activated219 in the store-consciousness? There is no other activation of the latent
impressions 220
except as causal conditions, as has been stated in this verse from the
Abhidharmasutra:221
All dharmas are collected in consciousness,
and likewise the latter in the former as
result and cause of each other, eternally.
[Response]: It need not lead to this conclusion. Why?222 Because of the difficulty in
distinguishing the sensation that belongs to it, [the store-consciousness] is not recog-
nized as being pertinent to sense-experience, like actual consciousness is, or it should
be known as something pre-eminent, like the sun. Accordingly, only actual
consciousness is the basis for the sense-experience of the three kinds of sensation - the
store-consciousness is not. Moreover, in this context [the store consciousness] is
intended as the basic causal condition, not just a causal condition. Likewise, under the
influence of wholesome and unwholesome dharmas, the store consciousness incor-
porates the latent impressions consisting in both the karma-result and the natural
outcome-result, whereas 223, under the influence of the undefined dharmas (it incor-
porates] only the latent impressions that belong to the natural outcome-result. Hence
the store consciousness is the basic causal condition for all impure dharmas in their
entirety. However, actual consciousness is the predominant causal condition for the
store consciousness it is not the basic causal condition224. Thus, that the actual
consciousness is a causal condition is not a [wrong) conclusion.

[4] Sense-experience refers to sensation; It is [described as] sense-experience
since just the three modes [of sensation] are 'partaken of 225, what is ant is: they are
experienced. Sensation is like the essence of the flavour of existence. Due to the latter,
naive people are attached to sense-objects226 for the sake of the full sensory experience
of them. Others believe that sense-experience refers not just to sensation but also to
the perception of objects, but this is not so because it is in contradiction with
[Vasubandhu's] commentary which states: "sense-experience refers to sensation".
Moreover, since the perception of an object is not different from consciousness, it
would not be logically tenable227 that it can be a mental concomitant. The discrimi-
nation of what has been sensed refers to ideation, because it consists in the appre-
hension of the particulars, such as what is pleasurable. The stimulations towards
sense-experience and ideation refer to the formative forces of conscious-
ness 228, volition and mental attention etc.
[5] Alternatively, he says: "sense-experience refers to sensation", because one experi-
ences an objective support according to its nature; and because one experiences the
karma of what is to be sensed as pleasure etc. Thus229, since sensation consists in the
sensory experience of both sense-objects and their karma, it is sense-experience.
Discrimination refers to ideation since it discriminates the mark (cihna) of the sense-
object, i.e. its conventional sign (vyavahära-nimitta). The stimulations towards differ-
ent objective supports on the part of consciousness are the formative forces 230; hence,
through the influence of volition etc., consciousness partakes of a different objective
support 231. Will-power and the like are referred to by the term "etc.".
The actualizing (characteristic] has now been described in terms of from whence [it
manifests], what kind of nature232 it possesses and its purpose.

Now he states the characteristic of defilement:

h. The Characteristic of Defilement.
I.11 cd
Due to: (a) concealing, (b) implant-
ing, (c) conducting, (d) encapsulat-
ing, (e) completing, (f) threefold
discriminating, (g) sense-experienc-
ing and (h) attracting;
(i) Fettering, (j) directing and (k)
suffering the world is defiled.
In the above: (a) it is due to concealing, because of the obstruction
of [one's] vision [of phenomena] as they are in reality, by ignorance.
(b) It is due to implanting, because of the establishment of the latent
impressions of karma in consciousness, by the formative forces. (c) It
is due to conducting, because it is made to reach the place of rebirth, by
consciousness. (d) It is due to encapsulating, of the individual nature
by name form. (e) It is due to completing, by the six sense-fields. (f)
It is due to threefold discriminating, by contact. (g) It is due to sense-
experiencing, through sensation. (h) It is due to the attracting, of the
new existence projected through karma, by craving. (i) It is due to the
fettering, of consciousness to the sense-desires etc. that are conducive
to rebirth, through the graspings. (j) It is due to directing, because the
karma that has been performed is directed towards the provision of the
karma-result in the new existence, by becoming. (k) It is due to
suffering that the world is completely defiled, by birth, old-age and
death. This:
43
Threefold, twofold and sevenfold
defilement [manifests] from the
imagination of what is unreal.
Defilement is threefold: the defilement of moral defilement, the
defilement of karma and the defilement of rebirth. Of these, the defile-
ment of moral defilement consists in ignorance, craving and grasping.
The defilement of karma consists in the formative forces and becoming.
The defilement of rebirth consists in the remaining [seven] elements.
Defilement is twofold: defilement as cause and defilement as result.
Of these, the defilement as cause includes those elements which have
moral defilement and karma for their own-being. Defilement as result
includes the remaining [elements].Y35.6
44
Sevenfold defilement refers to the seven types of causes: (a) the
cause of erroneous inversion, (b) the cause of projection, (c) the cause
of leading, (d) the cause of possession, (e) the cause of sense-experi-
ence, (f) the cause of attraction and (g) the cause of anxiety233. Of
these, the cause of erroneous inversion is ignorance. The cause of
projection is the formative forces. The cause of leading is conscious-
ness. The cause of possession is name / form and the six sense-fields.
The cause of sense-experience is contact and sensation. The cause of
attraction is craving, grasping and becoming. The cause of anxiety is
birth, old-age and death. And all of these defilements manifest from the
imagination of what is unreal.
[Sthiramati]
[1] Now he states the characteristic234 of defilement. The characteristic of
defilement refers to that mode in which the defilements of moral defilement, karma and
rebirth, while in the process of manifesting, lead to the complete defilement of the
world. Although it is insubstantial 235, samsāra is generated just from the imagination
of what is unreal. In order to demonstrate this it is stated:
I.10 ab
Due to: (a) concealing, (b) implant-
ing, (c) conducting, . (d) encapsulat-
ing etc.
These twelve elements of dependent origination are shown with reference to 236 the
actualizing side [of consciousness).
[2] In the above, it is due to concealing, ...that the world is defiled; the
latter portion of this statement [i.e. "the world is defiled"] refers to all [twelve
elements]. How is it that [the world] is defiled due to concealing and by what is it con-
cealed? Hence he says: because of the obstruction of [one's] vision [of
phenomena] as they are in reality, by ignorance. Since ignorance237 consists
in the absence of vision, when the sphere of one's vision of reality is hidden, the vision
of what is real does not arise. Consequently, because it obstructs the arising of one's
vision of the real, ignorance is an obstruction to [the arising of the vision of what is
real; furthermore, the vision of the real consists chiefly in supramundane wisdom. The
latter, which is subsequently attained because it arises subsequently [to the path of
vision] and which consists in learning, reflection and meditative development which

purify it because of that understanding, is described as the vision of the real238.
Because it obstructs the vision of what is real, ignorance is described as the causal
condition for the formative forces, thus it is said: "due to concealing by ignorance, the
world is defiled".
[3] It is due to implanting; that the world is defiled - this is understood. As to the
agent, locus and object of implanting, he says: of the latent impressions of
karma in consciousness, by the formative forces. Therein, the formative
forces consist in karma of body, speech and mind and its essential nature can be vir-
tuous, non-virtuous or neutral. It is a formative force (samskāra) since it formatively
influences (abhisamskaroti) the new existence; what meant is: it implants what was
not previously implanted 239; it is just this [sense that is expressed by the term
"formative force", but not all [its meanings]. Moreover, since they have the capacity to
project the new existence because of the influence of ignorance240 and not merely on
account of their existence, it is said that the formative forces have ignorance for their
causal condition. Accordingly, they bring about the new existence for one whose
knowledge 241 has not yet arisen, but not for one whose knowledge has arisen. Ignor-
ance is not described as the causal condition for the formative forces merely as the
predominant [causal condition] because it is the general causal condition in the
manifestation [of the new existence] as well, for ignorance is likewise associated with
all moral defilement. Just as it is the causal condition in general for the arising of the
moral defilements that do arise242, so too is it (the causal condition] for the volitions
which arise243 from the latter. Even when the [meritorious 1244 formative forces mani-
fest, i.e. those that follow as a consequence of the genuine wish for245 the special states
of existence and enjoyments, ignorance which is innate to them246, is their general
causal condition. Also, [when there is the arising] of neutral247 [formative forces] that
arise 248 with the notion that one can escape to those levels 249, ignorance, which is

innate to them 250, is their general251 causal condition. Thus it is described as the causal
condition for the formative forces. In the above, the store-consciousness is intended
by the term: "consciousness", and not the actual consciousness because of the impossi-
bility of being conveyed to the place of rebirth by the actual consciousness whose
continuity is interrupted 252, and also because the latent impressions of karma are not
established therein by the formative forces since both the wholesome and defiled
[dharmas] cannot be brought together. When [Vasubandhu] says: "[it is due to the
implanting] of the latent impressions of karma...", just what is this that is described as
the latent impression of karma? It is the 'seed' of the future birth253, i.e. a causal entity.
For example, a grain of rice is the seed, i.e. the causal entity, for the arising of a sprout
[which develops] through a transformation in dependence upon special conditions such
as soil, ash and manure. Because of the establishment...; this term expresses
implanting again through a different synonym. Furthermore, "establishment" in this
context refers to the augmentation of that 'seed' in the continuum of consciousness
from the very beginning254, by these [formative forces]; for, no previously non-
existent 'seed' of any dharma that is accompanied by impurity is generated, like in the
case of one without impurity. In this way, the world is defiled due to the generation of
the 'seed' of the new existence in consciousness, by the formative forces.
[4] It is due to conducting; that the world is defiled. Since the agent, locus and
object of conducting is not discerned, he says:. because it is made to reach255 the
place of rebirth256, by consciousness. Conducting refers to the conveying of
the latent impressions of the 'seed' of the new existence, from the place of death to the
place of rebirth, by consciousness which is fully developed by karma and which
functions as a continuum 257. After considering it in this way258, then the conscious-
ness at conception cannot have the formative forces for its causal condition; and it has
been demonstrated that only the consciousness belonging to the previous existence has
the formative forces for its causal condition, because the arising of an effect from a
cause that has perished is not tenable. Since those who have gained the formless
attainments are reborn in that very place where they die, how can they be conveyed to a
place of rebirth in the formless [realms]? [Rather] it should be understood according to
the circumstances, as is the case with name / form.

[5] It is due to encapsulating259; that the world is defiled. As to the agent,
locus 260 and object of encapsulation261, he says: of the individual nature, by
name form. Because name / form are [equivalent to the five aggregates. The
latter, after appropriating conception, while in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth
stages of embryonic development262, and before the six sense-fields have arisen,
comprise name / form which have consciousness for their causal condition. Thus, the
differentiation into different homogeneous groups is accomplished through a special
activation within that [name / form]. And when the latter have arisen, their individual
nature is differentiated due to the difference in homogeneous groups, such as between
human and animal; thus it is said that the individual nature is encapsulated by name /
form. Alternatively, it envelops the whole individual nature up until death263 because
the whole is determined as a causal state from the beginning. Or else, although it is not
differentiated264, the individual nature is enveloped by name / form, thus he shows it to
be separate; just as everything conditioned is included in the five aggregates [yet are
separate from them]; however, only 265 the sense-fields of creatures of miraculous birth
(aupapăduka) have consciousness for their causal condition266 (and not name / form].
Consequently, it should be known that name / form have consciousness for their causal
condition, according to the circumstances.
[6] It is due to completion; that [the world] is defiled 267. As to the agent, locus268
and object of completion, he says: of the individual nature which is included in name /
form 269, by the six sense-fields. For the individual nature 270 is described as
incomplete in the state of name form because of the absence of the sense-fields of
sight etc. Moreover, although the tactile and mind sense-fields do exist in that state,
they too are definitely incomplete because as a ['field' comprising] both that which is
based [i.e. the object of the senses] and the basis [i.e. the sense organs], it is incom-
plete. Furthermore, the basis271 is complete in the state of the six sense-fields because
of the actualization of sight etc. The tactile sense-field is also complete because of the

completion of sight etc. which is based on it272. How is it that sight etc. are based on
it273? Because their functioning depends upon it. The mind sense-field too, which is
included in the six consciousnesses, is completed at this time because of the completion
of the basis 274 in its entirety. Also, since the major and minor members [of the body]
are complete 275 only in the state of the six sense-fields276 because the basis is complete,
it is said that the world is defiled by the six sense-fields.
[7] It is due to threefold discriminating; "that the world is defiled” is under-
stood. "Threefold" refers to the combination of sense faculty, sense-object and
consciousness. Contact refers to the discrimination of the three modes of modifi-
cation of the sense faculty and is conducive to the arising of the sensation of pleasure
etc. It is described as contact (sparśa) since it is an aspect of that likeness of modifi-
cation of the sense faculty which it touches (sprșati)277. Alternatively, contact which
has the six sense-fields for its causal condition, produces a threefold modification of
the sense faculty that is conducive to the sensation of pleasure etc.
[8] It is due to sense-experiencing278, through sensation; because sensation
is experienced on account of craving; what is meant is: 'consumed with relish'. Alter-
natively, the sense-experience of sensation is due to the experience of karma279 that is
virtuous etc. Alternatively, in this context sense-experience refers to the experience of
a sensation and when pleasure etc. is experienced, due to the full development therein
of [sensations] such as pleasure, the world is defiled by [subsequent] passion, hatred
and delusion.
[9] It is due to the attracting; since the agent and object of attraction are not
discerned, he says: of the new existence projected through karma, by crav-
ing; i.e. [the attraction] of the new existence projected due to the maturation of its 'seed'
on account of the formative forces in consciousness, by craving, which can be likened
to the moisture 280 [in the generation of a seed]. Then, after securing the generation of
the new existence on account of the 'moistening', i.e. on account of the indiscriminate

[11] It is due to directing; here too when questioned by another, [Vasubandhu]
himself responds: because the karma that has been performed is directed
towards the provision of the karma-result in the new existence287, by
becoming. Thus, the karma performed in the past is the cause of consciousness and
as being pertinent to the new existence is in state of latent impression; it receives an
existence since the 'fruit' of the karma-result acquires a functional status and is directed
towards accomplishing the projection of an existence288. Thus the world is defiled due
to directing289, by becoming.
[10] It is due to the fettering; when questioned as to the agent, locus and object
of fettering, [Vasubandhu] himself says: of consciousness to the sense-desires
etc. that are conducive to rebirth282, through the graspings. Conscious-
ness, which is projected by karma by means of the four graspings that are char-
acterized by notional attachment 283 and the passion of sense-desire, is fettered to, i.e.
fixed in284 sense-desire, false view, morality and observances and false view of self285
which are conducive to rebirth because consciousness abides therein [in the new birth]
by force of the passion of sense-desire286,
[12] It is due to suffering that the world is completely defiled by birth,
old-age and death 290. Thus, when there is the actualization of the new existence
due to becoming, from the very outset [the world] is defiled as the consequence of the
coagulation of consciousness in semen and blood at the time of impregnation.
Similarly, it is defiled due to the to-and-fro movement [of the foetus] midway between
the stomach and the abdomen of the mother. Similarly, it is defiled because of the
mother's inability to dispel anxiety and anguish when eating and moving about.

[13] Since it is in motion (gacchati), it is [described as] the 'moving', [i.e. the world]
(jagat); what is meant is: it progresses from an homogeneous condition to a momentary
condition. By "it is defiled" is meant; in [all] the three realms of existence, [the world]
is afflicted on account of birth, old-age, sickness and death etc. and on account of its
incessant motion through a regular succession of moments. Others believe that the
term "it is defiled" means: 'it is not purified'. Thus, these twelve elements of dependent
origination which are characterized by defilement, arise on account of these eleven
modes beginning with "due to concealing" as the direct counterpart to purification; and,
beginning with ignorance, they form a sequential progression, since each subsequent
element is brought about by each preceding element.
50
Similarly, the world291 is defiled by coming out292 [of the womb] through a restricted
and impure passage. Again, the world is defiled insofar as one is born only to be
deprived of293 cherished youth and vitality by old-age characterized by baldness and
grey hair etc.294 and by death which is characterized by the dissolution295 of name /
form.
[14] How many kinds of defilement have been demonstrated in total through these
twelve elements of dependent origination? Hence he says:296 these twelve elements
of dependent origination are:

The word "and" has a conjunctive and repetitive298 sense. Since moral defilement itself
is defilement, it is described as the defilement of moral defilement. Similarly are the
defilements that consist in karma and rebirth [so-called], for moral defilement manifests
as defilement [in general] because it is harmful to both oneself and others; as is said in
a Sutra: "one who is enamoured 299 and overcome with passion is intent upon harming
himself, is intent upon harming others and is intent upon harm in both (this and the
next world]. Aversion and delusion should be understood in the same way."
"300 And
it is defilement because the defilements that consist in karma and rebirth are generated;
accordingly, the karma projects the rebirth under the influence of moral defilement.

into being [only] on account of the manifestation of moral defilement and since there is
the bond of conception in a new existence for one whose mind is defiled, the defile-
ment that consists in rebirth is a cause [for the defilement of the world]. Consequently,
since the Arhat does not possess a defiled mind, there is no bond of conception.
Moreover, karma whether pure or impure is [equivalent to] defilement because it both
causes bodily and mental fatigue in the present301 and provides the karma-result in the
future. Rebirth too is [equivalent to] defilement because it is the locus of all
misfortune.
[15] Defilement is threefold; because the cause is differentiated as twofold. The
defilement of moral defilement consists in ignorance, craving and
grasping302; the latter form a trio because they have the nature of moral defilement.
The defilement of karma consists in the formative forces and becoming;
the latter form a pair because they have the nature of karma. However, there is this
difference: karma, in its state as essential nature consists in the formative forces, but in
its state as 'seed' it consists in becoming. The defilement of rebirth consists in
the remaining [seven] elements, i.e. consciousness, name form, the six sense-
fields, contact, sensation, birth, old-age and death, since these are included within
rebirth.
[16] Defilement is twofold, since the cause is not differentiated. The defile-
ment as cause includes those elements which have moral defilement and
karma for their own-being303; defilement as result includes the remain-
ing elements. Of these, the defilement as cause304 is pertinent to karma and moral
defilement because the latter are engaged in the generation of rebirth which: (a) begins
with consciousness and concludes with sensation, (b) has the nature of birth and (c)
possesses the distress of old-age and death³05. Moreover, defilement as result includes
the remaining elements beginning with consciousness, because they are the result of
karma and moral defilement.
[17] Furthermore, that same process of dependent origination consists in a sevenfold
defilement which refers to seven kinds of causes because they are the causes
of: (a) erroneous inversion, (b) projection, (c) leading, (d) possession, (e) sense-
experience, (f) attraction and (g) agitation. Of these, the cause of erroneous
inversion is ignorance, for one who has succumbed to ignorance erroneously
inverts what is impermanent etc. as being of the nature of something permanent etc.

due to his confusion about reality. The cause of projection is the formative
forces, because they establish in consciousness the 'seed' of rebirth which consists in
four of the elements (of dependent origination]. The cause of leading307 is con-
sciousness, because it conveys one who has died here in this world to the place of
rebirth. The cause of possession is both name / form and the six sense-
fields, because that which is led [i.e. consciousness] possesses a (particular] homo-
geneous grouping on account of name / form and the six sense-fields. The possession
just by name form was mentioned in the above where the womb of creatures born
from a womb was intended. Here, the possession by the six sense-fields as well is
mentioned having regard for creatures of miraculous birth. Alternatively he wishes to
say that, prior to [its possession) by the latter, just the individual nature is possessed by
name form; however, since it refers to the possession]308 of either the completed
[state], or that which is incomplete there is no contradiction here. The cause of
sense-experience is contact and sensation ³09, because the sense-experience of
wholesome and unwholesome karma-result is on account of experience, together with
its cause. The cause of attraction is craving, grasping and becoming; a
naive person whose karma-result has been experienced, craves for various feelings;
when craving intensifies he clings to sense-desires etc. on account of his craving for
both the union with, and non-separation from, the latter. As the consequence of the
grasping for these [sense-desires] his karma belonging to the past, which pertains to
the new existence and which is in a state of latent impression, is transformed. This
leads to the imparting of the karma-result, in accordance with what has been projected,
then after being activated it is becoming'. Moreover, that [karma] is attracted, i.e. is
directed 310 towards the actualization of the new existence projected by the formative
forces on account of craving, grasping and becoming. Alternatively, craving, grasping
and becoming are the cause of attraction since they are directed towards one of the two
latent impressions of karma conducive to the passion of sense-desire, on account of
craving. The cause of anxiety is birth, old-age and death; thus, here one
experiences the pain of birth, old-age and death among the various classes of sentient
beings because of the attraction of birth, as well as [experiencing] an endless variety of
suffering that consists in sorrow, lamentation, depression and perturbation.
[18] In the above, moral defilement and karma311 are shown as general and specific
causes [respectively] of rebirth, through the description of threefold defilement. Moral
defilement is the general cause [in the germination] of the 'sprout' of rebirth, just as soil
is [for a plant]; however, karma is the specific cause, just as the seed is [the specific

cause] for its sprout because the differentiation among rebirths is according to the
differentiation in that [karma). Alternatively, although there are not three separate
segments that comprise the past, present and future in this regard (i.e. dependent orig-
ination], he nevertheless demonstrates that it does consist in karma, moral defilement
and their result.

315
[19] Through the statement about twofold312 [defilement] he demonstrates that this 313
is merely cause and result and that no other agent of action nor agent of sensation is
defiled in this regard. Alternatively, the cause refers just to karma and moral defile-
ment in this context because it is seen that the presence or absence of rebirth is due to
the presence or absence of these two [i.e. karma and moral defilement]; hence, rebirth
is indeed the result of them. Therefore, he demonstrates that there is neither cause nor
result in this regard, but in every case [i.e. in each of the twelve elements] there is a
state possessing the five aggregates.
[20] Furthermore, two kinds of dependent origination have been demonstrated
through the explanation of the sevenfold causes, namely: that characterized by project-
ion and that characterized by actualization. Of these, that characterized by projection
has been explained through the seven elements of dependent origination by demon-
strating: (a) thet by which it is projected, (b) the way in which it is projected and (c)
that which is projected. That which is characterized by actualization [has been
explained] through the five [remaining] elements [by demonstrating]: (a) that by which
there is the actualization of what has been projected, (b) the way in which it actualizes
and (c) the actualization (itself], as well as the distress [implicit] therein. What is the
agent of projection? The formative forces which have ignorance for their causal con-
dition. How so? After becoming acquainted with erroneous inversion due to delusion
about reality 314, [ignorance] formatively influences the wholesome, unwholesome and
neutral formative forces. How is it projected by those formative forces? They
establish it in the appropriate place315 of rebirth due to the development of the 'seeds' in
consciousness. What is projected? All that pertains to the new existence, i.e. name /
form, the six sense-fields, contact and sensation, respectively. By what means is there
the actualization of that which is projected in this way? As has been said, [it is actual-
ized] in stages from what was previously projected through grasping which has for its
causal condition that craving which has already arisen in dependence upon the
sensation that has arisen in the present lifetime. How is it actualized through this
[grasping]? The karma which is in the state of latent impression within consciousness
is caused to come into being through that [grasping], for many kinds of latent

this actualization? It is that birth in the future of the name form etc. that has been
projected. Now, when that occurs what is distressful? Old-age and death, because one
is deprived of cherished youth and vitality316. [Objection]: What if one were to
suggest that the 'cause of leading' is meaningless here? [Response]: It is not meaning-
less317 for [its inclusion] is for the purpose of removing the understanding³
318 that, after
the existence that pertains to death is severed, there is the arising of a [new] existence
that pertains to birth [- thus invalidating dependent origination].
[21] All these defilements manifest from the imagination of what is
unreal319, since the mind and the mental concomitants are the basis of defilement ³20
Moreover, it been stated that: 321 "the imagination of what is unreal consists in the
mind and the mental concomitants that pertain to the three realms of existence" (1.8 ab).

The Summary Meaning of the Imagination of
What is Unreal.
55
[To recapitulate], the summary meaning of the imagination of what is
unreal is revealed as consisting in nine types of characteristic: (a) the
characteristic of existence, (b) the characteristic of non-existence, (c)
the individual characteristic, (d) the characteristic of the totality, (e) the
characteristic of the expedient for entry into the characteristic of non-
existence, (f) the characteristic of the differentiation, (g) the character-
istic of the synonyms, (h) the actualizing characteristic and (i) the char-
acteristic of defilement.
[Sthiramati]
[To recapitulate], the summary meaning of the imagination of what is
unreal...; the explanation of the meaning in detail is for the purpose of reaching an
understanding with ease. Whereas the explanation of the summary meaning is for the
purpose of remembering it. Consequently, both meanings are stated here: (a) The
characteristic of existence: "there is the imagination of what is unreal" (I.1 a).
(b) The characteristic of non-existence: "the duality is not found therein" (I.1
b). (c) The individual characteristic: "consciousness comes into being in the
appearances of objects, sentient beings, the self and representations" (1.3 ab). (d) The
characteristic of the totality: "the imaginary, the other-dependent and indeed the
perfected" (1.5 ab). (e) The characteristic of the expedient for entry into the
characteristic of non-existence: "based upon perception, non-perception comes
into being" (1.6 ab). (f) The characteristic of the differentiation: "the imagina-
tion of what is unreal consists in the mind and the mental concomitants that pertain to
the three realms of existence" (I.8 ab). (g) The characteristic of the synonyms:
"therein, vision in regard to the object consists in consciousness, but in regard to
particulars, it consists in the mental concomitants" (1.8 cd). (h) The actualizing
characteristic: "the first is consciousness as causal condition, the second pertains to
sense-experience" (1.9 ab). (i) the characteristic of defilement: "due to conceal-
ing, implanting, conducting, encapsulating..." (1.10 ab) etc.N22.17

imagination of what is unreal, he
emptiness should be understood.
[Sthiramati]
Y45.15 [1] Having stated the ninefold characteristics of the imagination of what is
unreal, he now explains the manner in which emptiness should be
understood322. What is the relation here [between them]? The two were introduced
by him [i.e. Vasubandhu] as: (a) the imagination of the unreal and emptiness; and (b)
purification which is preceded by defilement and the correct determination of real
nature (dharmata) which has for its basis an understanding of the dharmas. Hence,
immediately following the explanation of the imagination of the unreal, he explains the
manner in which emptiness should be understood.

Now (a) the characteristic of empti-
ness, (b) its synonyms, (c) their
meanings, (d) its differentiation and
(e) logical proof, are to be under-
stood in total.
Now (a) the characteristic [of empti-
ness], (b) its synonyms323 etc.
(a) The characteristic, in this regard, consists in the denial of both existence and non-
existence³24 because emptiness pervades all differentiations 325. (b) A synonym is a
different name326 [for something]. (c) possession of a similar quality on the part
of the synonym being the reason for the use of the synonym - constitutes the meaning
of the synonyms. (d) Although [emptiness] is devoid of conceptual differentiation
because it is characterized by non-differentiation, like space, differentiation (can be

made] because of its different states that are associated with or are separate from
adventitious secondary defilement. Moreover, its differentiation is sixteenfold accord-
ing to the imputative differences in regard to the personal entity (pudgala) and the
dharmas. (e) The logical proof refers to the reasoning in regard to the demonstration of
the differentiation of emptiness. What then is the reason that emptiness should be
understood by way of these modes? It should be understood: (a) by way of the char-
acteristic by those who seek purity because it is the objective support of purity. (b)
For the sake of non-confusion in regard to the excellent327 explanations by means of
synonyms in other Sutras [it should be understood] by way of its synonyms. (c)
When the meaning of its synonyms is understood328 [it should be understood] by way
of the meaning of its synonyms329 because emptiness is ascertained as the objective
support of purity. (d) Since it is purified when defilement is removed [it should be
understood] by way of its differentiation in order to generate diligence for the relin-
quishment of 330 that defilement. (e) It should also be understood by way of the logical
proof of its differentiation since, although there is no modification, its differentiation is
easily understood due to an awareness of the logical proof of its differentiation.
a. The Characteristic of Emptiness.
How should the characteristic be understood?
I.13 ab
The non-existence of the duality,
which consists in the existence of a
non-existent, is the characteristic of
emptiness;
There is the non-existence of the duality of apprehended object and
apprehending subject. The existence of that non-existent is the charac-
teristic of emptiness. Thus it has been revealed that emptiness has the
characteristic of the own-being of a non-existent. Moreover, this own-
being of that non-existent, it:

Neither exists nor does it not exist;

Read: paryayarthataḥ in place of paryayarthaḥ in conformity with the previous explanations.
Read perhaps: -prahaṇayadarotpadanartham in place of -prahanaya yammotpädanartham; Tib. sparis

trary to Y's fn.4 p.46.58
How can it be non-existent? Because there is the non-existence of
the duality. How can it be not non-existent? Because there is the exist-
ence of the non-existence of the duality. And this is the characteristic
of emptiness. Therefore, in relation to unreal imagination:
1.13 d
Y47
The characteristic consists neither in
difference nor identity.
If there were difference, real nature (dharmata) would be something
other than a dharma, like the impermanence and painfulness [of some-
thing impermanent and painful], which is not tenable. If there were
identity, there would not be an objective support of purity, [consisting
in direct intuition]331, nor would there be a universal characteristic. In
this way, its characteristic has been revealed as being devoid of identity
and difference.
[Sthiramati]
Y46.17 [1] How should the characteristic be understood? Since the characteristic
was listed initially 332, hence it is that which is queried from the very beginning.
I.13 ab
The non-existence of the duality,
which consists in the existence of a
non-existent, is the characteristic of
emptiness333.
Thus should it be understood. There is the non-existence, in the nature of an
entity, of the duality of apprehended object and apprehending subject,
because its nature is imaginatively constructed either in the imagination of what is
unreal, or by the imagination of what is unreal. This existence of that non-exist-
ent duality is the characteristic of emptiness. Owing to the rules of prosody in
the above verse, the abstract suffix334 [i.e. the tã of śünyatā] is to be regarded as
expressed although omitted. What is meant by "the existence of a non-existent"? The
nature of a non-existent is existence, otherwise, because its non-existence would not
exist as an [empty] existent3³35, there would be the existence of the existent duality.
This is why he says: Thus it has been revealed that emptiness has the char-

acteristic of the own-being of a non-existent³36, i.e. it is not characterized by
the nature of an existent. [Objection]: The word "existence" is superfluous here
because this meaning is understood as being implicit in the word "non-existence" even
if the word "existence" is omitted, since it is a statement about the denial of existence.
[Response]: It is not superfluous. If it were only stated that "the non-existence of the
duality is the characteristic of emptiness", one would understand 337 the non-existence
of the duality as just an independent reality, like the non-existence of the horns of a
hare, and not the fact that it consists in real nature, like the painfulness etc. [of some-
thing painful]. Therefore the non-existence of the duality is thus described as empti-
ness and the existence of its non-existence in the imagination of what is unreal is also
described as emptiness. The fact that [emptiness] has the nature of real nature is
demonstrated because it is included as the characteristic of the existence of a non-
existent.
[2] Alternatively, since the word "non-existence" in the statement "the non-existence
of the duality is emptiness" has only general significance, it cannot be discerned here
which non-existence is intended. Thus in order to demonstrate its absolute non-exist-
ence it is said: "there is the existence of the non-existence of the duality in the imagina-
tion of what is unreal", for antecedent non-existence [i.e. before coming into being] and
subsequent non-existence [i.e. after passing from being] cannot be spoken of other
than as self-appropriation ³38. Moreover, reciprocal non-existence, i.e. as having a
single basis, is not tenable because [separate] basis is required in both cases. There-
fore, because it appropriates the characteristic of the non-existence of an existent, it has
been shown that it indeed the absolute non-existence of the apprehended object and
apprehending subject that is [equivalent to] emptiness.
[3] If emptiness has the nature of non-existence, how can it be described as the
absolute? Because it is the object of the highest direct intuition, like the impermanence
[of what is impermanent], but not because it is an entity. Moreover, this does not have
a non-existent own-being, because this own-being of that non-existent, it339:
I.13 c
Neither exists nor does it not exist;
How can it be non-existent? Because there is the non-existence of the
duality, for if it were an existent there would not be the absolute non-existence of the
duality 340, nor would there be the real nature of the imagination of what is unreal.
How can it be not non-existent? Because there is the existence of the

non-existence of the duality, 341 for the non-existence of the duality is not
[equivalent to the non-existence, by way of own-being, of the non-existent duality. If
it were that non-existent, the duality would exist and there would not be the real nature
of the imagination of what is unreal; and, by analogy; [there would be no] imperma-
nence and painfulness [of what is impermanent and painful]. It is said to be neither
existent nor non-existent because it has the nature of the non-existence of a permanent
and pleasurable entity which is imputed through erroneous inversion on the part of
sentient beings.
[4] If the emptiness of the imagination of what is unreal is real nature, 342should this
be described as other than that [imagination of what is unreal], or not other? Hence he
says: and this 343 is the characteristic of emptiness; i.e. it is the very own-being
of non-existence 344. Alternatively, existence itself has the nature of the denial of non-
existence. Therefore, in relation to unreal imagination:
1.13 d
The characteristic consists neither in
difference nor identity.
If there were difference, real nature (dharmata) would be something
other than a dharma which is not tenable. Why is it not tenable? Because if
its characteristic were different from a dharma, real nature would in fact be another
dharma, like any dharma other than it; however, one dharma cannot be the real nature
of another dharma because, in that case, another dharma would have to be sought [to
account for real nature] and there would be an infinite regress. Like the imperma-
nence and painfulness (of something impermanent and painful]; i.e., just
as impermanence is not other than what is impermanent and painfulness [is not other}
than what is painful 345, so too is emptiness not other than what is empty. If there
were identity, there would not be an objective support of purity, nor
would there be a universal characteristic. Since one is purified by it, the path
is purity 346. The path would not be an objective support, like the individual char-
acteristic of a dharma, because there would be no difference from the individual char-
acteristic of that dharma. Therefore, since it would not be different from the individual
characteristic, the universal characteristic would not be tenable. Also, since it can be
differentiated from something else, just as the essential nature of one dharma [can be
differentiated from another], universality is lost. Alternatively, because the individual
characteristic would not be different from this [universal characteristic] there would be

no difference, like [in the case of the essential nature of an existent thing347.
Consequently, there would be no universal as well because the universal characteristic
depends upon the fact of differentiation348 [i.e. such as between the universal and the
individual characteristic]. Alternatively, an objective support of purity is an objective
support for purification; and the individual characteristic of something, if it is taken as
[an objective] support, does not bring purity because all sentient beings would already
be purified.
[5] If [emptiness] cannot be described in terms of difference and identity [in relation to
the imagination of what is unreal], why is the doctrine of the Nirgrantha not given
credence? Because one who believes in the Nirgrantha doctrine does not make a
distinction in regard to the difference or identity of something that truly exists ³49.
However, since emptiness is not an existent, there is no fault here.
[6] Thus emptiness is: (a) the characteristic of non-existence, (b) the characteristic of
the essential nature of non-existence, (c) the characteristic of the absence of the duality
and (d) its characteristic has been revealed as being devoid of identity
and difference. The characteristic of emptiness has now been described.

A synonym 350 is well known as a different word351 for the one thing. It is described
as a synonym since it is expressive of a synonymous meaning. The one and the same
emptiness is explained in other Sūtras by these terms. Although these five synonyms
as mentioned in the verse are the principal ones, the other synonyms³52 that are not
mentioned here are to be learned from the scriptures; for example: the absence of the
duality, the realm without conceptual differentiation, real nature, the inexpressible,
absence of cessation, the unconditioned and nirvāṇa etc.
c. The Meaning of the Synonyms of Emptiness.
How should the meaning of the synonyms be understood?
I.15 abcd
The meaning of the synonyms are,
respectively: (a) immutability, (b) the
absence of erroneous inversion, (c)
the cessation of those [signs], (d) the
sphere of the Noble Ones and (e) the
cause of the noble qualities.
It is thusness in the sense of immutability, considering that it is
eternally just thus. It is the limit of what is real in the sense of the
freedom from erroneous inversion because there is no foundation for
erroneous inversion. It is signless in the sense of the cessation of
signs because of the absence of all signs. Because it is the sphere of
the direct intuition of the Noble Ones, it is the absolute for it is the
domain of the highest direct intuition. Because it is the cause of the
noble qualities, it is the dharmadhātu, for the noble qualities arise with
that as their support in this context the meaning of "dhatu" is 'cause'
(hetu).
352
353
[Sthiramati]
[1] How should the meaning of its synonyms be understood ³53? He
shows this as follows: these words are not metaphors, rather, they conform with the
actual meaning [of emptiness].
350 Ms.(13b.8): iti paryayo; disregard Y's fn.6 p.49.
351 Read: bhinnasabdatvena prasiddhaḥ in place of bhinnaśabdatvam pratyāyayati; Tib. sgra tha dad

Read: vijñeya in place of jayate; cf. Bhāşya N23.17.The meaning of the synonyms are,
respectively: (a) immutability, (b) the
absence of erroneous inversion, (c)
the cessation of those [signs], (d) the
sphere of the Noble Ones and (e) the
cause of the noble qualities.
It is thusness in the sense of immutability. What is meant is: in the sense of
unchanging. In order to demonstrate just this, he says: considering that it is eter-
nally just thus354. What is meant is: it is unchanging because it is unconditioned
always, i.e. at all times 355. It is the limit of what is real in the sense of the
freedom from erroneous inversion; the real means: the true and non-erroneously
inverted. The limit is the extremity; i.e. beyond this there is nothing to be known.
Hence the limit of what is real356 is described as the extremity of what is real. How
can thusness be described as the extremity of the knowable?357 Because it is the
sphere of direct intuition that is purified 358 from obscuration consisting in the know-
able. The words: "in the sense of the freedom from erroneous inversion" are equiva-
lent to: 'in the sense of the freedom from superimposition and negation'. Here now he
gives the reason: because there is no foundation for erroneous inversion.
Erroneous inversion is [equivalent to] conceptual differentiation; [emptiness] is not a
foundation 359 for erroneous inversion because it is not an objective support for
conceptual differentiation. It is signless in the sense of the cessation of
signs360. Signlessness, in this context, is described as the cessation of signs. In
order to demonstrate just this, he says: because of the absence of all signs.
Since emptiness is empty of all signs, both conditioned and unconditioned, it is
described as signless. It is signless because of the non-existence of all signs; only that
which is without signs361 is signless. Because it is the sphere of the direct
intuition of the Noble Ones, it is the absolute 362. For, supramundane direct
intuition is the highest (parama); the object (artha) of that is the absolute (paramārtha) -
in order to demonstrate just this, he says: since it is the domain³63 of the high-
est direct intuition. 364 Because it is the cause of the noble qualities, it

is the dharmadhātu. In this context it is the noble qualities that are [referred to] by
the word dharma, i.e. those beginning with correct view and concluding with correct
liberation and direct intuition; since it is the cause of these, it is the source (dhātu). In
order to illustrate just this he says: for the noble qualities arise with that as
their support. Since this term dhatu also occurs in the sense of a base for both the
individual characteristic and the [twenty-four] secondary forms of matter365, he says:
in this context, the meaning of "dhatu" is 'cause' (hetu); for example, [a
mine is described as] the source of gold or the source of copper³66. Other synonyms
that are also mentioned in other Sūtras should be explained by way of their intrinsic
meaning in accordance with this method.

and apprehending subject; or else, it was stated that its differentiation should be under-
stood immediately following the [section on the] meanings of its synonyms. Hence,
immediately after the explanation of the latter, he asks: how should the differen-
tiation of emptiness be understood? The imagination of the unreal is
[equivalent to] defilement when that is relinquished, it is described as purity; and at
the times of defilement and of purification367 there is nothing else that is subject to
defilement and to purification apart from emptiness. Therefore, in order to demonstrate
that at the times of defilement and of purification it is just emptiness that is subject to
defilement and to purification, he says:
I.16 a
As defiled and pure;
Thus is its differentiation.368 Since it is not known when it is defiled and when it
is devoid of stain, he asks: in which state is it defiled and in which is it
pure 369?
1.16 b
it is both accompanied by stain and
devoid of stain ³70 etc.
[Emptiness] is respectively determined to be accompanied by stain371 and as having its
stain relinquished depending upon whether or not there is a turning about of the basis.
Emptiness does not manifest for those who do not know, whose mental continuum
possesses the stain of defilement of the notional attachment to both the apprehended
object and apprehending subject and passion etc., due to the faults of both lack of
insight and wrong insight with regard to such [people] it is determined as bei
accompanied by stain. However, the emptiness which is unblemished like space mani-
fests continually for the Noble Ones whose minds are free from erroneous inversion
because of their direct intuition of reality with regard to such [people] it is said to
have had its stain relinquished. The fact that emptiness has a relationship372 with
defilement and purity in this way should be seen, although its own-being does not
possess stain because it is luminous by nature.
[2] If, after being stained...373 Since a differentiation in state is not seen without
a modification, and since modification is logically connected with production and
destruction, he says: how can it not be impermanent since it possesses the
quality of change? Because there is no other modification of emptiness apart from

Purity is considered as like the
purity of elementary water, gold and
space.
Therefore, it is not impermanent. For example, elementary water, gold and space do
not possess stain for their own-being because they do not have such an own-being;
both when possessing adventitious stain and also when adventitious stain is removed,
while not taking on a different own-being, they remain pure. Similarly, emptiness too
is defiled by adventitious stain and is purified as the result of the removal of that,
although its own-being is unchanged. For, he who determines the one and the same
entity initially as having the characteristic of defilement and subsequently as
having purity for its own-being, does not [avoid the conclusion] that a dharma which is
modified is destroyed due to a modification in its own-being. However, this is not so
when both [i.e. defilement and purity] are adventitious; therefore, this [process] does
not 'touch' the real nature of change [i.e. emptiness).

The Sixteen Kinds of Emptiness.
There is another differentiation, [namely], the sixteen types of
emptiness: (a) internal emptiness, (b) external emptiness, (c) internal

sattva aspires].
-
Of these, the emptiness of the enjoyer refers to the internal sense-
fields. The emptiness of enjoyment [refers to the external [sense-
fields]. The body belonging to those is the physical body which is the
locus of both the enjoyer and enjoyment the emptiness of that is
described as internal and external emptiness. The foundation for the
support refers to the inanimate world the emptiness of that is descri-
bed as universal emptiness because of its extensiveness. Moreover, as
to the knowledge of emptiness through which the internal sense-fields
etc. are seen to be empty the emptiness of that is the emptiness of
emptiness. Also, the way in which they are seen in an aspect of the
absolute the emptiness of that is the emptiness of the absolute. And
there is the emptiness of that for the sake of which the bodhisattva
aspires. For the sake of what does he aspire?

virtues;
[For the attainment] of the wholesome which is both conditioned and
unconditioned.

existence, he does not throw away or dismiss; the emptiness of that is

The bodhisattva aspires for the
purity of the Buddha qualities.
Such as the [ten] powers, the [four] intrepidities and the special
qualities etc. The establishment of the [first] fourteen emptinesses
should be understood in this way. What again is emptiness in this
regard?
1.20 abcd
The non-existence of the personal
entity and of the dharmas is [one]
emptiness here, and the actual exis-
tence of their non-existence in that
[enjoyer etc.] is another emptiness.
The non-existence of the personal entity and the dharmas is one
emptiness and the actual existence of their non-existence in the above-
mentioned enjoyer etc. is another emptiness. In order to state the char-
acteristic of emptiness he respectively determines emptiness as twofold
at the end, [namely], the emptiness of non-existence and the emptiness
of the own-being of non-existence for the purpose of avoiding impu-
tation in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas and the negation
of their emptiness, in due order. The differentiation of emptiness
should be understood in this way.
[Sthiramati]
[1] Since all differentiations of emptiness should be described in the section that
explains its differentiation376, he says this is another differentiation: the six-
teen types of emptiness. It is sixteenfold according to its differentiation in
relation to [various] entities, however, there is no differentiation in regard to its own-
being which consists in the non-existence of the duality. These sixteen pes are taught
in the Prajñāpāramitãs as emptiness, beginning with internal emptiness and concluding
376 Ms.(15a.1); prabheda...; disregard Y's fn.3 p.52.Y53
69
with the emptiness of the own-being of non-existence. These should be known in
brief as:
The emptiness of the foundation for:
(a) the enjoyer, (b) enjoyment, (c)
the body [which is the locus] of
these and (d) the support etc.
Emptiness is a universal characteristic because all dharmas have the essential nature of
the non-existence of the duality. Since it is not possible to show its multiplicity in any
other way, he shows its multiplicity by way of its multiple foundations.
1.17 ab
[2] From the very beginning, the enjoyer is to be annihilated [through clear under-
standing]377 in order to abandon one's affection and notional attachment to it; for this
affection and notional attachment are impediments to the attainment of liberation and
Buddhahood. Immediately after that, the enjoyment belonging to that [enjoyer] [is to
be annihilated]. Immediately after that, the physical body which is the locus of both of
these [is to be annihilated]. Then, the inanimate world, i.e. the support for the physical
body which is the locus for both [the enjoyer and the enjoyment] is to be annihilated
[through clear understanding] in order to destroy the grasping of and affection for [the
inanimate world] as belonging to the self because it is of service to the enjoyer. These
are the four types of foundation - the emptiness of these is described as the emptiness
of the foundation.
[3] Of these, the emptiness of the enjoyer refers to the internal sense-
fields 378, beginning with 'sight' up until 'mind'. Because there is no agent of enjoy-
ment apart from these and because they see the eyes etc. as active in the sense-
experience of objects, people have an erroneous view of the 'enjoyer' especially in
regard to sight and the other [senses]; therefore the emptiness of the sense-fields of
sight etc. is described as the emptiness of the enjoyer.
[4] The emptiness of enjoyment [refers to the external [sense-fields] ³79;
beginning with 'form' up until the 'non-sensible'. Since they are enjoyed (bhujyante) as
entities of the sensory domain, they are [described as] enjoyments (bhojana). Hence
the emptiness of the external sense-fields is described as the emptiness of enjoyment.
[5] The body belonging to those is the physical body because both the
enjoyer and the enjoyment are established as mutually inseparable [entities]380 in

the physical body; hence the emptiness of that is described as internal
and external emptiness³81.
[6] The foundation for the support refers to the inanimate world; because
it is perceived as the foundation for the support of sentient beings in every respect³82
This is why he says: the emptiness of that is described as universal empti-
ness because of its extensiveness. The word "foundation" is connected
individually [with each of the four categories discussed].
[7] To that bodhisattva-yogi who is mentally attentive, through proper mental attention
accompanied by deliberation in regard to the emptiness of the four types of entity 383
that are to be known, a different 'sign-grasping' becomes evident, [namely] - that
knowledge of emptiness through which this [entity] consisting in the internal
and external sense-fields etc. is seen to be empty384. There is [a twofold] con-
ceptual differentiation: (a) the notional attachment to the apprehended object and
apprehending subject and (b) just this here is an aspect of the absolute according to
what is seen through that knowledge of emptiness. For the sake of the annihilation
[through clear understanding] of these two modes of conceptual differentiation which
have the sign of error pertinent to the spiritual level of the yogi, (a) the emptiness of
emptiness and (b) the emptiness of the absolute [are indicated], respectively. These are
indicated, bearing in mind that the words "knowledge" and "aspect" are [respectively]
omitted 385 [i.e. the full expressions would be śünyatā(jñāna)śūnyatā and
paramärtha(ākāra)śünyata. Alternatively, that knowledge is described as emptiness³86
because it has emptiness for its object. The emptiness, of the existence of the
apprehended object and apprehending subject, of that is the emptiness of empti-
ness. Also, the way in which the latter, i.e.] the internal sense-fields etc., are
seen through that knowledge of emptiness as the absolute in this context the
emptiness of that aspect is the emptiness of the absolute. What is the
reason? Because the absolute is empty of the imaginary nature387.
[8] The other 'sign-grasping' [referred to above] is harmful to the meditative develop-
ment of emptiness; the essential nature of an entity (bhāva) is imputed upon that for
the sake of which the bodhisattva aspires388 to [the understanding of] empti-
ness. In order to clearly understand this emptiness has been explained, beginning with

For the sake of what does he aspire?

For the attainment of the dual
virtues;
He aspires to [the understanding of] emptiness for the purity [of all virtues] concluding
with the Buddha qualities; what is meant is: he cultivates emptiness [for the attain-
ment] of the wholesome which is both conditioned and unconditioned 389,
i.e. the path and nirvana390; the emptiness of the conditioned and the emptiness of the
unconditioned refer respectively to the latter two.

become wearied and completely abandon³93 samsāra.

tence". The words 396; "he does not throw away", express the same sense as "he
does not dismiss". If this is so, how then can the nirvana-realm that is devoid of
the remnants of existence be proven? It is an established fact that even in the nirvāṇa-
realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence, there is no interruption to the Dharma
Body belonging to the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, which is an entity free from
impurity 397 because of the non-existence of the body which is the karma-result of the
impure dharmas. Hence, the emptiness of that is described as the emptiness
of non-rejection.
[12]
And, for the purity of the spiritual
lineage (gotra);
The emptiness of this is intrinsic emptiness; here now he gives the reason: because
the spiritual lineage is intrinsic; how so? he responds: since it derives
from own-being 398. That which derives from own-being exists from time
immemorial; what is meant is: it is not adventitious. In the same way that some
[entities] in beginningless samsara are endowed with consciousness and some are non-
conscious, similarly, in this regard some [beings] endowed with the six sense-fields
belong to the spiritual lineage of the Buddhas and some belong to the spiritual lineage
of the śrävakas etc. Since the spiritual lineage consists in a regular sequence [of
rebirths] that is beginningless, it is not accidental like the difference between non-
conscious and conscious [entities]. Others believe that since all sentient beings belong
to the spiritual lineage of the tathāgata, the term "spiritual lineage" in this context
should be understood accordingly 39⁹9.

aspire to]? Hence he said: such as the [ten] powers, the [four] intrepidities
and the special qualities etc. In short, he undertakes [with this resolve]: "I
should strive400 for the attainment of all the Buddha qualities". This is why it is said:
"he cultivates emptiness"401. The emptiness of that is described as the emptiness of all
dharmas. What is 'cultivation' in this context? The unimpeded engagement402 of
cognition in regard to the object of cognition. Now the establishment of the
[first] fourteen emptinesses, beginning with internal [emptiness] and concluding
with403 the emptiness of all dharmas, should be understood in this way.
[15] What again is emptiness in this regard, i.e. in regard to the enjoyer etc.?
404 What is its essential nature? Hence he says:
1.20 abcd
The non-existence of the personal
entity and of the dharmas is [one]
emptiness here and the actual exis-
tence of their non-existence in that
[enjoyer etc.] is another emptiness.
The non-existence of the personal entity and the dharmas is one empti-
ness and the actual existence of their non-existence in the above-
mentioned enjoyer etc. is another emptiness. Of these, the non-existence of
the personal entity and the dharmas is [equivalent to the emptiness of non-existence.
The actual existence of that non-existence is [equivalent to] the emptiness of own-being
of non-existence. 405 For what reason are these two kinds of emptiness respectively
determined at the end?406 Hence he responds: in order to state the characteristic
of emptiness407. Why is there a re-statement of emptiness? Hence he says: for the
purpose of avoiding both imputation in regard to the personal entity and
the dharmas and the negation of their emptiness, in due order. In order to
avoid imputation in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas, he determines the
emptiness of non-existence; and in order to avoid negation in regard to the emptiness
of the latter, [he determines] the emptiness of own-being of non-existence. If the

emptiness of non-existence were not mentioned one may conclude that the dharmas
and the personal entity, whose essential nature is imaginary, do exist. If the emptiness
of own-being of non-existence were not mentioned, one may conclude that emptiness
is indeed non-existent and as a consequence of the non-existence of the latter, the
personal entity and the dharmas would exist like before.
[16] In the above, internal emptiness refers to: (a) the non-existence of: (i) the personal
entity, i.e. the 'enjoyer' and (ii) sight etc., whose characteristic is imagined, among the
internal sense-fields which have the [karma-] result-consciousness [i.e. the store-
consciousness] for their own-being and are regarded by naive people as constituting an
'agent of enjoyment', and (b) the actual existence of the non-existence408 of the latter.
External emptiness refers to: (a) the non-existence of: (i) enjoyment that pertains to the
self and (ii) form etc., whose characteristic is imagined, among the external sense-fields
which have the appearances of representations of form etc. for their own-being and are
regarded by naive people as objects of enjoyment, and (b) the actual existence of the
non-existence of the latter. Internal and external emptiness refers to: (a) the non-exis-
tence of: (i) a personal entity as 'enjoyer' in that body, i.e. the physical body, (ii) form
etc. which is imaginatively constructed by naive folk and (iii) the body itself, and (b)
the existence of the non-existence of the latter. Universal emptiness refers to: (a) the
non-existence of a world of sentient beings within the inanimate world, (b) the non-
existence, by way of essential nature, of such an imaginative construction and (c) the
actual existence of the non-existence of the latter. In regard to both the knowledge of
emptiness409 and an aspect of the absolute, the emptiness of emptiness and the empti-
ness of the absolute refer respectively to the non-existence of: (a) the knowledge of
emptiness, on the part of the knowing agent, which has the characteristic of an imagi-
native construction and (b) the aspect of the absolute on the part of the personal entity
who is the apprehender of the aspect410, and the actual existence of the non-existence
of the latter. Now, that for the sake of which the bodhisattva aspires, i.e. [the under-
standing of the emptiness of the conditioned411, concluding with the emptiness of all
dharmas refers respectively to: (a) the non-existence both of the dharmas which have
an imaginary characteristic and of the personal entity, among those elements beginning
with the conditioned up until all the Buddha qualities which are the aim of the
bodhisattva's accomplishment 12 and (b) the actual existence413 of the non-existence of

the latter. For there exists no personal entity, whether it be 'owner' or 'agent' pertinent
to the conditioned, nor does a conditioned [entity] exist in the nature imagined by naive
folk. These sixteen kinds of emptiness which pertain to the bodhisattvas and which are
not common to the śrävakas have been explained in brief in order to counteract all
grasping on account of conceptual differentiation, and also, in order to explain all
hidden meanings of the Sūtras.
[17] And in this respect, the object of emptiness, the own-being of emptiness and the
aim of the meditative development of emptiness have been shown by the Venerable
One. Of these, the object of emptiness refers to those subjects beginning with the
'enjoyer' up until the Buddha qualities; furthermore, the demonstration of the latter is
for the sake of showing that emptiness pervades all dharmas. The own-being of
emptiness refers to both the own-being of non-existence as well as the own-being of
the existence of non-existence414. Moreover, the demonstration of the own-being of
emptiness is in order to show the nature of escape415 from all [false] views since it
[acts as] counteragent to superimposition and negation. The aim of the meditative
development of emptiness begins with the [aspiration for the attainment of the dual
virtues (cf. I. 18a) and concludes with the [aspiration for the] attainment of the Buddha
qualities (cf. I.19cd). Furthermore, the demonstration of the latter is in order to
demonstrate that the culmination of the perfection of the Form and Dharma Body, for
oneself and others, is due just to the meditative development of emptiness416. The
differentiation emptiness should be understood in this way; i.e. it
should be known that [emptiness] is defiled in the stained state and is purified in the
stainless state; and it has a sixteenfold differentiation as just described, beginning with
internal emptiness.

e. The Logical Proof of Emptiness.
How is its logical proof to be understood?
1.21 abcd
If it were not defiled, all incarnate
beings would be liberated. If it were
not pure, effort would be in vain.
If the emptiness of the dharmas were not defiled by adventitious
secondary defilement, even when no counteragent has arisen, all
sentient beings would be liberated without any effort at all because of
the absence of defilement. Now, even when the counteragent has
arisen, should [emptiness] not become purified, undertakings for the
sake of liberation would be in vain. And so, after considering it in this
way:
I.22 ab
It is neither defiled nor is it unde-
filed. It is neither pure nor is it
impure;
76
How can it be neither defiled nor impure? [Because] by way of
intrinsic nature:
1.22 C
How can it be neither undefiled nor pure?
1.22 d
There is the luminosity of mind417;
Because of the adventitious nature of
defilement.
In this way, the differentiation of emptiness that was listed [above]
is proven.
[Sthiramati]
Y59.11 [1] Since its logical proof was listed immediately following the listing of the differen-
tiation418, immediately after the explanation of that he asks: How is its logical
proof to be understood?419 What is to be proven here? The fact that: (a) it is
defiled by adventitious secondary defilement and (b) it has purity of own-being. In the
above, with reference to the proof of the fact that it is defiled, he says:
417 Verse 22 cd is not found in P or D editions of the Bhäşya; cf. N's comments in the introduction
(pp.9-10) to his Sanskrit edition.

:Y60
1.21 ab
If it were not defiled, all incarnate
beings would be liberated420;
Liberation is [equivalent to the relinquishment of defilement; the relinquishment of
such defilement is due to the meditative development of the path. In this respect, if
the emptiness of the dharmas were not defiled by adventitious
secondary defilement, even when no counteragent has arisen; the word
"even" implies that like when it has arisen [it would not be defiled] - this being so, all
sentient beings would be liberated without any effort at all421 because of
the absence of defilement. The words: "without effort"422 are [equivalent to]
'without a counteragent'. However, since there can be no liberation for living beings
without the counteragent, in the state of ordinary people the fact of defilement of thus-
ness423
by adventitious stain must necessarily be admitted the differentiation of
emptiness as defiled is proven in this way.
[2] Now, in order to prove the differentiation [of emptiness] as purified, he says:
1.21 cd
If it were not pure, effort would be
in vain424,
It is [the effort] of incarnate beings that is referred to. Now, even when the
counteragent has arisen; the word "even" implies that like when it has not arisen
[it would not become pure]; should [emptiness] not425 become purified; this
being so, the undertakings for the sake of liberation would be in vain
because even through the meditative development of the counteragent, separation from
such stain would not occur and also because liberation is not possible for one who
possesses stain. However, [the undertakings] for the sake of liberation are not consid-
ered to be in vain; therefore, due to the practice of the counteragent, the purity of
emptiness, through the separation from adventitious secondary defilement, must
necessarily be admitted. The differentiation of the purity of emptiness is proven in this
way. In this context, defilement is due to the appropriation of the dharmas that consti-
tute defilement and purity is due to the appropriation of the dharmas that constitute
purity. However, neither defilement nor purity is considered to be manifestly present
for emptiness426 because real nature is dependent upon the dharmas. This is why he
says: "all incarnate beings would be liberated". The term "incarnate beings" in the

above refers to just the 'ground' (upādāna; rgyu) of these [i.e. defilement and purity].
Otherwise, if defilement or purity were manifestly present for emptiness, then what
connection would it have with incarnate beings, on account of which both the purity
and defilement of the incarnate beings is described as being due to the purity of empti-
ness and the defilement of emptiness, respectively? And when emptiness is defiled in
the state of ordinary people and is pure in the state of the Noble Ones this too427 has
been proven:
[3]
It is neither defiled nor is it unde-
filed; it is neither pure nor is it
impure. 42
428
How can it be neither defiled nor impure?429 It is definitely pure because this
is made clear through the use of the double negative. Here he quotes scriptural tra-
dition: [Because] by way of intrinsic nature:
1.22 C
There is the luminosity of mind;430
Here it is indeed the real nature of mind that is referred to by the word "mind" for the
[phenomenal] mind is characterized by stain.431 How can it be neither undefiled
nor pure? On the contrary, the use of the double negative makes it clear that it is
definitely defiled.
1.22 d
1.22 ab
Because of the adventitious nature of
defilement. 432
He shows that it is defiled but not intrinsically so433. Scriptural tradition is also quoted
here: "It is defiled by adventitious secondary defilement".
[4] When it has been differentiated as twofold, i.e. as defiled and pure, why then is a
fourfold differentiation mentioned? Some say that it is in order to demonstrate 34 the
distinction between the mundane path and the supramundane path, for, the mundane
path is defiled by the stain pertinent to its own level but not by that which belongs to a
lower [level] because [the former] is the counteragent to the latter. The supramundane
path is impure [in one sense] because it is differentiated as weak, middling etc., how-
ever, it is pure due to the absence of impurity; but not so in the case of emptiness.
Again, after describing [emptiness] as undefiled, others describe it as not impure in
order to distinguish it from the [sense-faculties] of sight etc., because sight etc. are not

defiled for they are unobscured and undefined yet are described as impure because they
are not intrinsically pure on account of their possession of impurity. Thus, after
describing it as undefiled, it is described as impure in order to distinguish it from
wholesome [elements] which are accompanied by impurity because that which is
wholesome and accompanied by impurity is not undefiled since it belongs to samsāra
and is pure because it has an agreeable karma-result. Real nature is definitely not so435,
for, in the defiled state it is described as defiled and consequently as being impure. In
this way, the differentiation of emptiness, by way of defilement and purity,
that has been listed [above] is proven436.

The Summary Meaning of Emptiness.
Y62
80
Therein, the summary meaning of emptiness should be known both
in terms of characteristic and establishment. Of these, in terms of
characteristic includes both the characteristic of non-existence and the
characteristic of existence. Furthermore, the characteristic of existence
includes both the characteristic as devoid of existence and non-exis-
tence and the characteristic as devoid of identity and difference. Again,
its establishment should be known in terms of the establishment of its
synonyms etc. In this regard, through these four modes of teaching: (a)
the individual characteristic of emptiness, (b) the characteristic of
karma [pertinent to its realization], (c) the characteristic of both its
defilement and purification and (d) the characteristic of reasoning
[pertinent to its proof] are made known these lead to the appeasement
of: (a) conceptual differentiation, (b) fear, (c) indolence and (d) doubt,
[respectively].
[Sthiramati]
Y61.22 [1] The summary meaning of emptiness 437 should be understood both in
terms of characteristic and establishment. Of these, in terms of charac-
teristic includes both the characteristic of non-existence and the
characteristic of existence. It [should be known] in terms of the characteristic of
non-existence because of the statement: "the non-existence of the duality" (I.13 a). It
[should be known] in terms of the characteristic of existence because of the statement:
"which consists in the existence of a non-existent" (I.13 b). Furthermore, the
characteristic of existence...; because of the statement: "it neither exists nor does
it not exist" (1.13 c); ...refers to both the characteristic as devoid of exis-
tence and non-existence438 and the characteristic as devoid of identity
and difference, because of the statement: "...this is the characteristic of emptiness.
Therefore, in relation to the imagination of what is unreal:" (I.13 c comm.) "The char-
acteristic consists neither in difference nor identity." (I.13 d). This is the summary
meaning in terms of characteristic.

[2] How should its summary meaning be understood in terms of establishment?
Again, its establishment should be known in terms of the establishment
of its synonyms etc.439 What is meant is: its synonyms, their meaning, its differ-
entiation and logical proof. Through these four modes of teaching, beginning
with the characteristic, (a) its individual characteristic, (b) the characteristic
of karma [pertinent to its realization], (c) the characteristic of both its
defilement and purification and (d) the characteristic of reasoning
[pertinent to its proof] are made known as the counteragents to the four types
of secondary defilement440. Of these, the individual characteristic [acts] as the counter-
agent to conceptual differentiation; the latter consists in the perception [of things]
as existent, non-existent, both [existent and non-existent] and different or identical.
The characteristic of karma [acts] as the counteragent to fear for those who, after
learning of the characteristic of emptiness, do not have firm conviction, for example,
(a) the karma that pertains to [the realization of] thusness that is free from error, (b) the
karma that pertains to the absence of erroneous inversion, (c) the karma that pertains to
the relinquishment of all signs, (d) the karma that exists in the sphere of all supra-
mundane direct intuition and (e) in regard to the objective support, the karma that
pertains to the causal ground of the noble qualities. Thus, the characteristic of the
differentiation is for the removal of indolence on the part of lazy people who, just by
learning of the own-being of emptiness and the karma [pertinent to its realization]
'seize' this as sufficient. The characteristic of reasoning is for the removal of doubt on
the part of skeptics who believe that [emptiness] is subject to defilement and
purification.

The ObscurationsN28.3
Y64
With reference to the obscurations, he says:

[Sthiramati]

1. The Five Obscurations Beginning with the
Pervading.
2
Of these, (a) the pervading refers to obscuration consisting in both
moral defilement and the knowable and is pertinent to those who belong
to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it forms the totality.
(b) The limited refers to obscuration consisting in moral defilement and
is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka
etc. (c) The excessive refers to [obscuration] that pertains only to those
who course in passion etc. (d) The equal refers to [obscuration] that
pertains to those who course in equal shares. (e) The obscuration com-
prising the acceptance and rejection of samsāra is pertinent to those
who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it is an
obscuration to the nirvana [wherein the bodhisattva is] not permanently
fixed. Thus these obscurations are elucidated respectively as being
pertinent to both, i.e., as pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual
lineage of the bodhisattva as well as those who belong to the spiritual
lineage of the śrävaka etc.
(a) The pervading, (b) the limited,
(c) the excessive, (d) the equal and
(e) acceptance and rejection are
elucidated as the obscurations that
pertain to the two.
[1]2 Immediately after the explanation of the characteristic is an appropriate place for
the explanation of obscuration and since [the latter] was mentioned immediately
following the former, [Vasubandhu] says: with reference to the obscurations,

based entirely on the Tib. Fn.15 below indicates the point where the Ms. begins.Y65
(e) acceptance and rejection are
elucidated as the obscurations that
pertain to the two.
3
The obscurations that pertain to the two refer to obscurations pertinent to those who
belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva and those who belong to the spiritual
Lineage of the śrävaka etc. This verse has been composed in order to demonstrate that
the differentiation among the obscurations is in accordance with the difference in
benefit that is obscured. Of these, the pervading refers to obscuration con-
sisting in both moral defilement and the knowable and is pertinent to
those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva. It is the
pervading (vyāpi) since it pervades or permeates (vyāpnoti). Because it is an
obscuration in regard to the totality of benefit; the totality of benefit is both benefit
for oneself and benefit for others. Alternatively, it is described as the pervading since
it pervades the obscuration that pertains to the bodhisattva according to the designation
of the two as obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable. Since
moral defilement is itself an obscuring, it is [described as] an obscuration. Herein,
secondary defilement is also referred to by the word "moral defilement" because it is
exactly similar in its nature as moral defilement. Otherwise, the words: "the character-
istic of moral defilement is ninefold" [verse II.1 d], would not include envy and avarice
since these two are both secondary defilements. It is an obscuration that consists in the
knowable because it is an obscuration in regard to the knowable. Since that which is
knowable is concealed (prāvṛta) on account of this, it is not the sphere of knowledge.
Alternatively, it is an obscuring of direct intuition in regard to the knowable because it
creates an obstruction to the arising of direct intuition in regard to the knowable. There
is the omission of the word "of" between the words "obscuration" and "knowable" [in
the compound jñeyāvaraṇa] as in the [tatpuruşa] compound 'a pot of oil' (tailakuṇḍa).
Furthermore, it consists in undefiled nescience. Those who belong to the spiritual
lineage of the bodhisattva endeavour in every way to produce the accumulations of
merit and direct intuition for the sake of the attainment of Buddhahood since it is the
culminating attainment3 in regard to benefit for both oneself and others. Because both
[those consisting in moral defilement and the knowable] are obscurations to the latter
[i.e. Buddhahood] they are determined as obscurations pertinent to those who belong
to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva. [Objection]: In this respect, given that the
pervading has the whole for its domain and the expression "the totality" means "in
every respect", how does the totality intimate pervading? [Response]: It is described as
obscuration that pervades because it forms the totality by way of its explanation as a
cause. Alternatively, the statement: "because it forms the totality" is made in order to
explain the word "pervading" as having the meaning of totality.

D: phul du byun ba thob pas (220a.5), although P: ...thob pa.Y66

85
[2] The limited refers to obscuration consisting in moral defilement and
is pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka
etc. It is designated as an obscuration since it is an obscuration in regard to just one's
own benefit and is described as "limited" because it does not pervade. Why does
undefiled nescience not pertain to śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas? Because if it is
determined that only obscuration consisting in moral defilement is pertinent to them,
then in that case, [undefiled nescience] is not an obscuration pertinent to them because
śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas [are said to] attain enlightenment even though it exists.
[Objection]: Is nescience on the part of the śrävaka etc. not an obscuration to the
arising of knowledge in regard to the sphere of the truth of suffering etc.? Therefore,
the two obscurations would be pertinent to them as well. Consequently, perhaps it
should not be said that only obscuration consisting in moral defilement is pertinent to
śrävakas etc.? [Response]: This is not so, since ignorance is determined just as obscur-
ation that consists in moral defilement because: (a) it is defiled, (b) it is adverse to
knowledge and (c) it is the root of samsāra. However it is not [determined as] obscura-
tion that consists in the knowable, like uncertainty. For example, uncertainty in regard
to the sphere of the truth of suffering etc. is not [uncertainty] in regard to other spheres
described as doubt and moral defilement, for it is only uncertainty in regard to another
sphere and not defilement nor doubt. Similarly, nescience in regard to just the sphere
of the truth of suffering etc. is ignorance and moral defilement but not in regard to
other spheres, for in regard to other spheres it is only nescience and not ignorance nor
moral defilement. Therefore, since [nescience] described as the obscuration that
consists in the knowable because it is an obscuration to the emergence of only the
direct intuition of what is knowable, moral defilement, karma and rebirth are not
produced as is ignorance. [Objection]: If this be so, [obscuration that consists in the
knowable] cannot be determined as the obscuration pertinent to bodhisattvas.
[Response]: This is not so [since] obscuration that consists in the knowable is the
obscuration pertinent to bodhisattvas because they are characterized by the accumu-
lations of learning. It is said:
Without applying himself to the five kinds
of learning, in no way can a Supremely
Noble One arrive at omniscience; thus, he
applies himself to these, either to restrain or
assist others or, for his own knowledge.4
[3] The excessive; even a small aspect of passion etc. that manifests continually and
to an excessive degree in those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva
4 This verse is from MSA XI.60:
vidyasthane pańcavidhe yogam akrtvä sarvajñatvam naiti kathamcit param āryaḥ/
ity anyeşâm nigrahaṇānugrahanaya svājňärtham vă tatra karoty eva sa yogam //Y68
86
and those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc. ...refers to
[obscuration] pertinent to those who course in passion etc. Those who
course in passion and the like refers to those for whom any passion manifests continu-
ously and to an excessive degree even in regard to a miserable things.
[4] The equal; i.e., obscuration pertinent to both those belonging to the spiritual
lineage of the bodhisattva and those belonging to the spiritual lineage of the śrāvaka
etc. It is equal because the two modes are absent; refers to [obscuration] pertin-
ent to those who course in equal shares. They who course in equal shares
refers to those for whom moral defilement manifests in conformity with the object, but
not continuously.
[5] The obscuration comprising the acceptance and rejection of
samsāra...; the bodhisattva accepts samsāra on account of his compassion yet, on
account of his wisdom, after observing the evil of samsara as it is in reality, he rejects7
it. Consequently, although free from moral defilement [himself], having regard for
sentient beings, he takes rebirth in the nirväpa [wherein the bodhisattva is]
not permanently fixed, because he is not permanently fixed in samsara or nirvāṇa.
The obscuration to this consists in the acceptance of samsāra as being overcome by
moral defilement or the complete rejection of samsăra without compassion, after
observing its evil as it is in reality. Others believe that nescience is described as an
obscuration herein because it is an obstruction to both compassion and wisdom.
Alternatively, as has been stated in the Maharatnakūta: "His mental disposition is
directed towards nirvāṇa but his application is directed towards samsara"8. This is the
unfixed nirvana of the bodhisattva. In this regard, in order to turn his back on nirvāṇa
he accepts samsāra with his mental disposition and application, just like a sentient
being who has no spiritual lineage. Similarly, in order to turn his back on samsāra, he
completely rejects samsāra with both his mental disposition and application directed
towards entering nirvāṇa, just like those who belong to the spiritual lineage of śrävakas
etc. Thus, both the acceptance of samsāra and its rejection are obscurations in regard
to the unfixed nirvana of the bodhisattva because they both constitute a falling to one
extreme away from samsāra as well as nirvāṇa. At the time that they become tathā-
gatas, bodhisattvas do not remain in samsāra because they have relinquished both the
obscurations that consist in moral defilement and the knowable. And because the
Dharma Body continues without interruption in the nirvana devoid of the remnants of

existence, they do not remain in nirvana like śrävakas and the like. Thus they are not
fixed permanently in samsāra or nirvāņa.

in regard to: (a) the path of the bodhisattva and the śrävaka etc., (b) their application,
(c) the result and (d) the unfixed nirvana [of the bodhisattva). Thus these
[obscurations are elucidated] respectively, i.e. as is appropriate. Therein, the
first and the last [i.e. the 'pervading' and 'acceptance and rejection'] are obscurations
pertinent to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva.
But that which follows the first [i.e. the limited'] is an obscuration pertinent to
those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc. The other
two [i.e. the excessive' and the 'equal'] are obscurations pertinent to both. In the
above, obscuration that consists in the knowable has been described as obscuration
that pertains to the bodhisattvas, moreover, it is known as undefiled nescience.

The fetters are obscurations⁹. The fetter of pride is an obscuration
in the clear comprehension of the false view of individuality because
the non-relinquishment of the latter is on account of the manifestation
of intermittent and continuous self-conceit at the time of direct reali-
zation. The fetter of ignorance [is an obscuration] in the clear compre-
hension of the foundation of the false view of individuality because the
lack of clear comprehension in regard to the aggregates that have been
appropriated is on account of that. The fetter that consists in false view
[is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the truth of cessation
because the fear of the latter is on account of the false views of
individuality and the grasping of extremes and is also due to negation
by wrong view. The fetter of clinging [to false views etc.] is [an
obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the truth of the path because
one clings to the highest purity with the wrong motive. The fetter of
doubt is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of the three jewels
due to the lack of true belief in the virtues of the latter. The fetter of
envy is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of gain and honour
because one does not perceive the faults of the latter. The fetter of
avarice is [an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of austerity
because one covets the necessities of life.
[Sthiramati]
[1] It is not known: (a) how many aspects there are to the obscuration that consists in
moral defilement which is the obscuration pertinent to the two [i.e. bodhisattvas and
śrävakas etc.], (b) what kind of essential nature they possess and (c) what it is they
obstruct, hence he says:
II.1 d
The characteristic of moral defile-
ment is ninefold.
It is the obscurations that are referred to. The characteristic of moral defilement is
[equivalent to] the essential nature of moral defilement. What are these ninefold
[fetters]? Hence he says: [they are]:
samyojanany avaraṇam but Tib. has simply sgrib pa yin; (D6b.2).Y70
11.2 a
The fetters etc.
They are fetters inasmuch as they fetter [people] to various sufferings. The various
sufferings which belong to the group of sense-desire, form and formlessness, refer to
the painful nature of suffering, the painful nature of change and the painful nature of
the formative forces as is appropriate to the three realms of existence. They begin with
the fetter of attachment and conclude with the fetter of avarice. Therein, repugnance
refers to aversion. Envy refers to intolerance in regard to another's success 10. Avarice
refers to miserliness concerning the necessities of lifell; these three pertain to sense-
desire. The fetter of attachment consists in the passion that pertains to the three realms
of existence. Similarly, the fetters of pride, ignorance, false view, clinging [to false
views etc.] and doubt all pertain to the three realms of existence. The fetter of false
view comprises the false view of individuality, the grasping of extremes and wrong
view. The fetter of clinging [to false views etc.) comprises the clinging to false view
and to morality and vows. Doubt is disbelief in regard to the [noble] truths and the
[three] jewels. Moreover, those other secondary defilements, such as anger, are defi-
nitely obscurations that consist in moral defilement because they are the
natural outcome of moral defilement and they are defiled. Envy and avarice are
referred to as fetters because of their predominance, for it is said in a Sutra: "O
Kausika, the gods and mankind possess the fetters of envy and avarice" 12.
89
[2] The obscurations that comprise these [fetters] are relevant to what?
Hence he says:
II.2 bc
They are relevant to anxiety,
equanimity and the insight into
reality;
Anxiety is included among the synonyms for despondency, hence it is said: the fetter
of attachment is an obscuration relevant to anxiety. Since the attachment to
the physical body, vitality, enjoyment and family etc. as well as to the meditative
absorptions and formless [attainments] is on account of this, one does not become
anxious of the three realms, although oppressed by the sufferings of samsära. The
fetter of repugnance is [an obscuration] relevant to equaniraity. How so?
Hence he says: because, on account of this, one is unable to be even-
minded, i.e. free from formative influence, in regard to the foundation of
repugnance, i.e., the cause of repugnance, especially something disagreeable
etc.; it is disagreeable insofar as it is the cause of depression. It is logical that it is not

90
possible to be even-minded in regard to the foundation of attachment because of the
absence of what is disagreeable. However, since the foundation of repugnance
consists in repugnance especially in regard to something disagreeable, one is unable to
be even-minded. Hence in order to demonstrate that the latter [i.e. the fetter of repug-
nance] is a greater evil than [the fetter of] attachment, he says: "especially". When one
who is engaged in meditative concentration gains equanimity of the formative forces,
his mind consequently becomes even. However, if the fetter of repugnance reaches an
excessive degree in such a person, then on account of the latter, he does not attain
equanimity in regard to the cause of repugnance; and when that occurs the self is
necessarily supported as an objective support; thus, on account of the fetter of attach-
ment he does not find solitude. Conversely, although isolated on account of the fetter
of repugnance he does not attain meditative concentration.
[3] Furthermore, the remaining seven [fetters] are obscurations relevant to
the insight into reality, i.e. they are obscurations to true insight. He asks: How
do they occur? Since this is not known he says: They occur respectively:
II.2 d
[In the clear comprehension] of: the
false view of individuality, the foun-
dation of the latter etc.
The fetter of pride is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the
false view of individuality. Pride herein refers to that arrogance of mind which
has the false view of individuality for its basis 13 and this is sevenfold ¹4 according to its
differentiation as pride, excessive pride etc.15 The clear comprehension of the false
view of individuality refers to the insight into the false view of individuality through
the discrimination of: (a) a self, (b) what pertains to a self, (c) the apprehending subject
and (d) the apprehended object, as well as through the discrimination ¹6 of an own-
being on the part of the dharmas as imagined by naive people. The fetter¹7 of pride is
an obscuration to that [insight] because it obstructs its arising. As to how and when
this occurs, he says: because the non-relinquishment of the latter is on
account of the manifestation of intermittent and continuous self-conceit
at the time of direct realization18. The time of direct realization of the truth is
equivalent to the condition that is conducive to penetration. In the above "intermittent"
refers to that which is interrupted by the counteragent; "continuous" refers to that

which is not interrupted by the counteragent. And this should be understood in regard
to strong and weak counteragents [respectively]. For as long as intermittent and con-
tinuous self-conceit19 manifests, there is no relinquishment of the false view of indi-
viduality since the arising of self-conceit is only on account of the false view of
individuality.
[4] The fetter of ignorance [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehen-
sion of the foundation of the false view of individuality. It is the fact that
it is an obscuration that is referred to. The foundation of the false view of individuality
refers to the five aggregates that have been appropriated because it arises from the
objective support that consists therein; as is stated in a Sutra:
Certain śramaṇas or brahmanas perceive the self as the self and are notionally
attached to it; it is just on the basis of these five aggregates that have been
appropriated that they perceive and are notionally attached to the latter.20
Just what is this clear comprehension? It is the perception of the emptiness of the self
and what pertains to the self21 and the emptiness of the own-being of the dharmas
which is imagined by naive people in regard to the aggregates as well as their percep-
tion as impermanent, painful, empty, without self or as originating etc. this is clear
comprehension of those [aggregates]. Here now he gives the reason: because the
lack of clear comprehension in regard to the aggregates that have been
appropriated is on account of that. Ignorance is an obscuration in the clear
comprehension of the aggregates because, on account of ignorance, there is the absence
of clear comprehension of these [as impermanent etc.] in regard to the aggregates
which are obscured by aspects of permanence etc.
[5] The fetter that consists in false view [is an obscuration] in the clear
comprehension of the truth of cessation; the word "obscuration" remains in
force. The fetter of false view comprises three false views: The false views of: (a)
individuality, (b) grasping of extremes and (c) wrong [view]. In the above, the false
view of individuality refers to the notion that there is a self or what pertains to a self
among the five aggregates that have been appropriated. The false view that consists in
the grasping of extremes concerns that same entity that has been construed as a self and
refers to the notion that it is eternal or that it perishes22. Wrong view refers to that
notion on account of which one negates an entity, whether it be cause, result, deed or
an actual existent, or else wrongly construes it. The clear comprehension of the truth

of cessation refers to [its comprehension] in accordance with the aspects such as the
tranquil. Just how can [false view] be an obscuration to that [clear comprehension]?
Hence he says: because the fear of the latter [i.e. cessation] is on account
of the false views of both individuality and the grasping of extremes
and is also due to negation23 by wrong view. Therein, on account of the false
views of individuality and the grasping of extremes one fears cessation, thinking: "I
will not exist in that [state]", also, on account of wrong view one negates it, thinking
there is indeed no cessation. In this respect, on account of the false views of individu-
ality and the grasping of extremes, one does not clearly comprehend [cessation] as
tranquil, sublime and as escape24; yet on account of wrong view one does not compre-
hend it as cessation. In this way the fetter that consists in false view becomes an
obscuration in the clear comprehension of cessation.
[6] The fetter of clinging [to false view etc.] is [an obscuration] in the
clear comprehension of the truth of the path25. Therein, the fetter of clinging
refers to both the clinging to false view and the clinging to morality and vows. Cling-
ing to false view therein refers to that notion in regard to false view and the five aggre-
gates that have been appropriated and which are the basis of false view26, as being pre-
eminent27 and so on. Clinging to morality and vows refers to that notion on the part of
one who perceives either morality, vows, both of these or the five aggregates that have
been appropriated and which are the basis of that [notion], as being [equivalent to]
purity, liberation or definitive liberation. Furthermore, the clear comprehension of the
path is in accordance with aspects, such as definitive liberation. Just how can the fetter
of clinging be an obscuration in the clear comprehension of the path? Hence he says:
because one clings to the [highest] purity with the wrong motive28; i.e.
because one clings to purity as either: (a) just morality and vows, (b) an abode of
pleasure pertinent to sense-desire, (c) ascetic practices or (d) the knowledge of enu-
merations etc. By clinging to a [false] view on account of just which one believes in
purity, one clings to that same [view] as being pre-eminent. Thus, on account of the
fetter of clinging [to false view etc.] one abandons the path and clings to purity with the
wrong motive29

[7] The fetter of doubt [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension of
the three jewels; the word "obscuration" remains in force. As to how this can be
so, he says: because of the lack of true belief in their virtues. The fetter of
doubt is perplexity in regard to the truths and the [three] jewels. There is clear com-
prehension in regard to the jewel of the Buddha as being the final basis for the
excellence and absence of all virtues and faults [respectively 30. There is clear compre-
hension in regard to the jewel of the Dharma: (a) as being the conveyance across the
ocean of samsära, (b) as having the nature of the absolute separation from all suffer-
ing31 together with its causes and (c) as providing the understanding of the latter.
There is clear comprehension in regard to the jewel of the Sangha as: (a) the locus for
the results of monkhood³2, (b) engagement in the latter and (c) the 'field' worthy of
supreme veneration. By acquiring perfect faith through the perception of truth and the
relinquishment of doubt³ one truly believes in the virtues of the three jewels and since
there remains no doubt that is not relinquished, the fetter of doubt is described 34 as an
obscuration in the clear comprehension of the three jewels.
[8] The fetter of envy is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of
gain and honour. Here now he gives the reason: because one does not
perceive the faults of the latter. For the fetter of envy, which has aversion for a
component, refers to the dissatisfaction of mind in regard to another's success and is
pertinent to one intent upon gain and honour³5. Clear comprehension in regard to gain
and honour is [equivalent to] the awareness that these are the basis of all misfortune³6
However, on account of envy one does not clearly comprehend gain and honour ³7 as
being adverse to all virtue nor as the root of various misfortunes. Hence the fetter of
envy is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of gain and honour.
[9] The fetter of avarice [is an obscuration] in the clear comprehension
of austerity. As to how this can be so, he says: because one covets the

necessities of life. Avarice which has passion for a component refers to miserli-
ness of mind in regard to goods and chattels on the part of one who is intent upon ³8 the
necessities of life. Austerity consists in the separation from from the necessities of life.
Its clear comprehension is [equivalent to] the understanding that it is the foundation or
basis of all virtue. However, one does not clearly comprehend it as the basis of all
virtue because one is intent upon the necessities of life on account of avarice.
Consequently, it is said that avarice is an obscuration in the clear comprehension of
austerity.39
[10] In [summary of the above, the fetters of attachment and repugnance are obscura-
tions in the endeavour to reach an understanding of reality [but the remainder are
not]40. The remainder are obscurations to the understanding of reality for one who has
[already] applied himself [in such an endeavour]. For this very reason the sequential
order of these [fetters] is given; for example, one who desires liberation41 should, from
the very beginning, necessarily cause his mind to shrink from samsāra. Following
from that, he should have equanimity towards everything. After that, the false view of
individuality should be clearly comprehended because it is the root of all misfortune.
Then, the foundation of the latter should be clearly comprehended as consisting in
suffering and its arising. Then, the cessation of the latter should be understood. Then,
the path of attainment should be understood. Then, one acquires perfect faith in regard
to the three jeweis due to the awareness of their virtues and the vision of the truth.
And since it is only on account of the force of the vision of the truth that one becomes
a seer of the faults and virtues [respectively] of gain and honour as well as austerity,
thus the sequential order of these obscurations should be understood in conformity
with the respective cause of the dharmas to be obscured 42. [Objection]: Since it is
possible that obscuration can pertain to all [the fetters] at all times43, the explanation of
obscuration as restricted to each individual foundation is not tenable. [Response]: A
restriction 44 to each individual foundation is not employed here; on the contrary, this
explanation is chiefly in terms of close contiguity.

The obscurations that pertain to
these [qualities] are to be known in
groups of three.
The three obscurations to the wholesome are: (a) lack of application,
(b) application in regard to unworthy objects and (c) superficial appli-
cation. The three obscurations to enlightenment are: (a) the non-arising
of the wholesome, (b) lack of mental attention and (c) incomplete accu-
mulations. Complete acceptance refers to the generation of the resolve
for enlightenment. The three [obscurations] to the latter are: (a) depri-
vation of spiritual lineage, (b) deprivation of good friends and (c)
mental exhaustion. Intelligence refers to the bodhisattva state. The
three obscurations to the recognition of the latter are: (a) deprivation of
spiritual practice, (b) living with stupid people and (c) living with
pernicious people. Therein, stupid people are [equivalent to] foolish
people; pernicious people are those who bear il will. The three
[obscurations] to absence of error are: (a) the disquiet of erroneous
inversions, (b) whatever remains from the three obscurations such as
moral defilement and (c) the non-maturation of the wisdom that brings
liberation to fruition. Absence of obscuration is [equivalent to the
relinquishment of obscuration. The three [obscurations] to the latter
are: (a) innate disquiet, (b) laziness and (c) carelessness. The three
[obscurations] to transformation, on account of which one's mind is
transformed into other modes and not into supreme and perfect
enlightenment, are: (a) attachment to existence, (b) attachment to
enjoyments and (c) faintheartedness. The three [obscurations] to lack
of fear are: (a) a low opinion of people, (b) a lack of firm conviction in
regard to the Dharma and (c) deliberation in accord with the letter as

regards its meaning. The three [obscurations] to lack of avarice are: (a)
a lack of enthusiasm for the true Dharma, (b) enthusiasm for gain and
honour and for veneration and (c) lack of compassion for sentient
beings. The three [obscurations] to mastery, on account of which one
fails to obtain supremacy, are: (a) loss of what has been learnt due to
the arising of karma conducive to the loss of the Dharma, (b) learning
little and (c) lack of the necessary preparation for meditative
concentration.

The qualities] beginning with virtue are:
(i) Virtue, (ii) enlightenment, (iii)
complete acceptance [etc.]
...are the ten qualities. Therein virtue, which is the cause of enlightenment, consists in
all the roots of the wholesome (dharmas]; enlightenment is the result of it. In the
above, virtue has been listed in general terms but it is not understood by way of differ-
entiation nor own-being, hence, in order to clearly illustrate these he elaborates:
II.9 abcd
...(iii) Complete acceptance, (iv)
intelligence 7, (v) absence of error,
(vi) absence of obscuration48, (vii)
transformation, (viii) lack of fear,
(ix) lack of avarice [etc.]
in regard to unworthy objects and
what is produced without application
[etc.]
45
46
These are described as virtuous. Since enlightenment cannot be understood by way of
own-being through words alone, he describes it as:

48
Read: -anavṛtti as per Ms.(21b.1) in place of -anăvṛttau.Y77
...(x) mastery.
[2] Some believe that since the obscurations to virtue and enlightenment are explained
as independent, as are [the obscurations to] complete acceptance etc., they are discerned
in this context just as independent [entities] but not as things that can be listed and
explained. [This is not so]; the obscuration to arising is determined in relation to virtue
and it is common to such things as the resolve for enlightenment because of the
necessity for the production of that virtue. The obscuration to complete acceptance etc.
and the obscuration to the basis are obscurations to complete acceptance etc. and are
different [from the obscuration to virtue]49. Also, since enlightenment is unshakable
and is to be attained, both the obscuration to its maintenance and the obscuration to its
attainment are respectively determined. Therefore, independence does not result here.
[3] And their sequential order in brief is as follows: Enlightenment is to be attained
after perfecting the root of the wholesome in its entirety. In detail [it is as follows]:
From the very beginning the resolve towards enlightenment should be generated
because it is the foundation for the accomplishment of benefit for both oneself and
others. Then comes spiritual practice in regard to [the six perfections], beginning with
generosity, which conforms with 50 the generation of the resolve, and, on account of
which, one is recognized51 as a bodhisattva. After that, as the result of continual
practice throughout immeasurable aeons 52 and in order to purify one's mental disposi-
tion through the collection of the accumulations of merit and direct intuition, the path of
vision, which has the nature of the absence of error, should be generated as the counter-
agent to error in regard to the personal entity and the dharmas. Then the path of
meditative development which is characterized by the separation from obscuration
should be followed to its culminating point in order to bring about the possession of a
special purity53. Then, all the mundane and supramundane roots of the wholesome
should, as they are collected, be transformed into enlightenment through application
that transcends that of the śrävaka etc. Then, one who has arrived in this condition has
no fear54 in regard to the profound and sublime explanations of the Buddha and the
bodhisattvas because he is mentally disposed towards universal enlightenment 55.

Then, one who is endowed with much learning56 and understanding teaches the sub-
lime Dharma for the purpose of bringing sentient beings to full maturation. After that,
it is said that one attains mastery, i.e. Buddhahood, when those to be trained are
brought to full maturation in order to liberate them.
[4] Here the obscurations are stated as thirty, but only ten qualities to be obscured [are
stated] beginning with virtue, hence he asks: which obscurations are to be
known as being pertinent to each of these [qualities] beginning with
virtue?
II.10 ab
The obscurations that pertain to
these [qualities] are to be known in
groups of three57;
In the above, the three obscurations [to the wholesome] are: (a) lack of
application, i.e. lack of enterprise. What is the obscuration in this context? One
does not apply oneself on account of any moral defilement, whether it be carelessness
or laziness. Or else, one does not apply oneself to that particular condition, whether it
be undefined or defiled, that possesses the 'seed' of moral defilement. It is described as
the lack of application since one does not apply oneself continually or respectfully
because [one's application] is insignificant but not because of an absence of application,
because if the latter were the case there would be no possibility of obscuration. (b)
Application in regard to unworthy objects58. Scriptural works, which are the
'doorway' (dvāra) to the origination of enlightenment and the roots of the wholesome
which bring about enlightenment, are worthy objects (āyatana). Something other than
the latter is an unworthy object (anāyatana). Application in regard to the latter is appli-
cation in regard to an unworthy object59, i.e. in regard to objects other [than worthy
objects]. What is the obscuration here? The nescience or moral defilement that
consists in wrong view on account of which one applies oneself to an unworthy object
as well as that application is the obscuration. (c) Superficial application. An
expedient60 is something fundamental (yon); application that is contrarywise to what-
ever expedient one possesses is superficial (ayoniśaḥ) application. It is mentioned in
this very scriptural instruction, namely:
For one who courses in passion, the meditative development of friendliness
is not an expedient for the relinquishment of passion, [likewise] the meditative

development of the impure62 is [not an expedient for the relinquishment of
repugnance] for one who courses in repugnance.
Here too, superficial mental attention or application which has that for its cause is an
obscuration.
[5] The three [obscurations] to enlightenment...; enlightenment consists in an
understanding that is in accord with its object. ...are: (a) the non-arising of the
wholesome, which has already been discussed. How can its non-arising be an
obscuration? When the wholesome does not exist there can be no enlightenment,
hence the non-arising of the wholesome is an obscuration to enlightenment. Alterna-
tively, that moral defilement or particular state which is an obscuration to the arising of
the wholesome 63 is also [an obscuration] to enlightenment, for that which is an obscu-
ration to the accumulations [of merit and direct intuition] is certainly also [an obscura-
tion] to its result. (b) Lack of mental attention, is [equivalent to] the lack of the
meditative development of [wholesome elements] that have already arisen; what is
meant is: they are not augmented64, Even though wholesome [elements] are produced
in a particular state, one is not mentally attentive time and again65 on account of moral
defilement such as laziness. This is the obscuration here. (c) Incomplete accu-
mulations. Enlightenment is attained through a certain amount of accumulations.
While the accumulations of merit and direct intuition are incomplete one abides in a
morally defiled condition like before, or eise, one has scanty accumulations. However,
another believes that although no distinction is made here, non-arising is intended just
as [an obscuration]66 to those elements conducive to penetration and not to others.
Also, there can be a lack of mental attention to those [elements conducive to penetra-
tion] that have arisen, although one is being mentally attentive; the non-accumulation of
what has been accumulated [on account of that] is described as an obscuration.
[6] Complete acceptance refers to the generation of the resolve for
enlightenment. Complete acceptance consists in the generation of the resolve for
enlightenment since the accumulations of merit and direct intuition, in their entirety, and
the result of these, i.e. Buddhahood, are to be completely accepted and possessed on
account of the fact that they should cause all sentient beings67 to be established in the
most excellent nirvāṇa realm devoid of the remnants of existence by means of this

inserted by Y on the basis of the Tib.; cf. his fn.6 p.78.Y79

[resolve for enlightenment]. Furthermore, this consists in the mental disposition to
perform acts of welfare for oneself and others, i.e., it is volition accompanied by will-
power. The three [obscurations] to the latter are68: (a) deprivation of
spiritual lineage; i.e. not having a spiritual lineage or belonging to the spiritual
lineage of the śrävaka etc. (b) Deprivation of good friends; i.e., although one
belongs to a spiritual lineage, one does not meet with those who inspire the generation
of the resolve for enlightenment69; or else, on account of these [people], one turns
away from enlightenment, or is not strengthened by the wholesome dharmas. Even
when one meets with good friends, there is (c) mental exhaustion70 - on account
of the sufferings of samsara the anxious minds of those who have wrong insight
aspire for parinirvāṇa as soon as possible. What are the obscurations here? (a) A
defect in causes [i.e. gotra], (b) a defect in conditions [i.e. kalyāṇamitra], (c) lack of
compassion for sentient beings71 or (d) laziness, since one who lacks compassion for
sentient beings is either exhausted or is lazy.
[7] Intelligence72 refers to the bodhisattva state, for they are suited to the
careful consideration, in every respect, of all that is to be known, because, in compari-
son to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka etc.73, they naturally
have keen faculties. And it is just the bodhisattva who possesses intelligence because
of his firm conviction in the profound and sublime Dharma; others do not. The
bodhisattva state consists in spiritual practice that is not erroneously inverted for the
benefit of others74. (a) Deprivation of spiritual practice75; i.e. one does not
engage in the practice of the [six] perfections etc., for, one who is situated in'
spiritual practice76 is known as a bodhisattva. (b) Stupid people are [equivalent
to] foolish people77; what is meant is: people who do not investigate [phenomena]
because, stupid people do not know that a particular person is a bodhisattva even
though he is occupied with spiritual practice 78, (c) Pernicious people are those
who bear ill will; i.e. those who bear enmity towards bodhisattvas. These people

fail to see the real virtues of a bodhisattva because they seek79 his point of vulnera-
bility. Having concealed the real virtues [of the bodhisattva] they promulgate non-
existent faults after superimposing the latter upon the former because they see non-
existent faults or have harmful thoughts on account of enmity. What is the obscuration
here? (a) That which is adverse to the [six] perfections such as generosity, (b)
nescience and (c) dislike.
[8] The three [obscurations] to absence of error...; error is on account of
superimposition and negation80; its counteragent is the absence of error and is
[equivalent to] the path of vision; ...are: (a) the disquiet of erroneous inver-
sions. Some believe that this refers to the maturation of the latent impressions of
notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending subject. Others
believe it refers to the maturation of the 'seeds' lodged in the store-consciousness of: (a)
all propensities that are to be abandoned by means of [the path of] vision, or (b) unde-
filed nescience which is an impediment to 82 the facility for an understanding 83 of the
all-pervading dharmadhātu. Others believe that erroneous inversion refers to the
conceptual notion of the self etc. in regard to the absence of self etc. (b) Whatever
remains from the three obscurations such as moral defilement84. Therein,
obscuration that consists in moral defilement is the moral defilement such as passion
which manifests intensely and for a long time; it is an obscuration to the absence of
error because there is no opportunity for the application of the counteragent to it.
Obscuration that consists in karma is the karma that brings an immediate result etc. and
which leads necessarily 85 to unfortunate states of existence. Obscuration that consists
in the karma-result is the unfortunate state of existence etc. and one who is born therein
does not have the good fortune of the arising of the noble Dharma. Moreover, what-
ever is left as a remainder from these [three], i.e. moral defilement, karma and rebirth,
are obscurations but they are definitely not the entire [obscurations]86. (c) The non-
maturation of the wisdom which brings liberation to fruition87; this refers
to the fact that the wisdom which brings about liberation is ineffective. Some believe

that this is because of the failure to attain the condition conducive to penetration. How-
ever, others say that there are two [types] of wisdom in this regard which bring
liberation to fruition: (a) absence of conceptual differentiation and (b) the application of
the latter³8. The non-maturation of both of these, which respectively consists in an
incapacity concerning the understanding of reality and an incapacity concerning the
state that causes the latter89, is due to the fact that the accumulations are incomplete.
What are the obscurations here? (a) The maturation of the latent impressions of moral
defilement that are to be abandoned by the path of] vision90, (b) whatever remains
from the obscurations such as moral defilement, (c) nescience which is an impediment
to the maturation of wisdom and (d) the non-completion of the accumulations.
[9] Absence of obscuration is [equivalent to the relinquishment of
obscuration. It is the relinquishment of obscuration since obscuration is relin-
quished on account of it. The absence of obscuration consists in the path of meditative
development because this is the counteragent to obscuration. The three
[obscurations] to the latter are: (a) innate disquiet. This refers to the
propensity for moral defilement that is to be abandoned by meditative development.
Alternatively, this refers to the maturation of the 'seeds' that are lodged 91 in the store-
consciousness, of: (a) the innate (elements] such as the false view of self and (b) unde-
filed nescience 92 which is an impediment to the penetration of the highest meaning of
the dharmadhātu etc93. (b) Laziness is [equivalent to] slothfulness; this refers to the
lethargy of mind that has delusion for a component 94. (c) Carelessness consists in
both an excessive attachment to sense-objects and an inattentiveness in regard to the
wholesome. Some believe that carelessness here refers to the savouring 95 of meditative
concentration. Due to disquiet and laziness in this respect, the path is not cultivated

and due to carelessness the mind is not protected from the unwholesome. What are the
obscurations here? These very three.
[10] The three [obscurations] to transformation 96 on account of which
one's mind is transformed into other modes; [and is not transformed into
supreme and perfect enlightenment]97. Transformation 98 therein refers to [the trans-
formation] of the roots of the wholesome which have already arisen and is restricted to
[the transformation] by mind into Buddhahood alone. There are three obscurations to
the latter. Which are these three? Those, on account of which, mind is transformed
into modes99 other than Buddhahood, i.e. into samsāra or the enlightenment of the
śrāvakas etc., ...and not into supreme and perfect enlightenment. And these
are: (a) attachment to existence, (b) attachment to enjoyments and (c)
faintheartedness. "Existence" refers to the five aggregates that have been appro-
priated. Since they are enjoyed (bhujyante), the sense-objects of form etc. are
"enjoyments" (bhoga). "Attachment" is the strong desire for the latter two.
"Faintheartedness" refers to a mind that lacks sublimity; i.e. one has a low opinion of
oneself and thinks: "how can someone like mel00 obtain Buddhahood?" In regard to
this, on account of the attachment to existence and the attachment to enjoyments, one's
mind is transformed into a propitious state of existence; however, on account of faint-
heartedness, the mind is transformed into the śrävaka vehicle etc. What are the obscu-
rations in this regard? They are: the craving for existence and enjoyments, laziness and
lack of compassion.
[11] The three [obscurations] to lack of fear. What is this lack of fear? It is a
fearless state that consists in a firm conviction101 in regard to emptiness and the
profound and sublime Dharma of the Buddha and the bodhisattvas. (a) A low
opinion of people; i.e. erroneous understandings and statements about people who
proclaim the way of the universal vehicle, or disbelief in the virtues of morality, medi-
tative concentration and wisdom etc. (b) lack of firm conviction in the
Dharma; i.e. disbelief concerning the words of the Buddha as expounding a profound
and sublime way and as having meaning that is not erroneously inverted. (c)
Deliberation in accord with the letter as regards its meaning 102; i.e. one
understands only the verbatim meaning of 'non-arisen', 'without cessation' and 'peaceful
from the beginning' etc., but the meaning that is intended in reality is not understood.

Therefore, there is no firm conviction in regard to the meaning of 'non-arisen' etc.
What are the obscurations here? (a) Doubt and (b) nescience which is adverse to both
wisdom and meditative concentration and is also adverse to a conclusive investi-
gation¹03 of the meaning that is intended.
[12] The three [obscurations] to lack of avarice... It is on account of the lack
of avarice that one teaches the Dharma, either for the continued existence of the true
Dharma, or in order to assist others. are: (a) lack of enthusiasm for the true
Dharma; i.e. not holding it dear. It is on account of this that the true Dharma's long-
lasting existence is not ensured because it is not conveyed to another's mental
continuum. (b) Enthusiasm for gain and honour and for veneration; i.e.
holding them dear. One worries that another may be equal or even superior to oneself
concerning enthusiasm for the true Dharma, and consequently, one does not teach the
Dharma because of fear that gain etc. will be hindered. [Alternatively], although one
does not cling to gain and honour, there is: (c) a lack of compassion for
sentient beings; i.e. one does not teach the Dharma] 104 due to an absence of com-
passion for sentient beings because one who lacks compassion is not affected by the
sufferings of sentient beings. What are the obscurations here? (a) Lack of enthusiasm,
(b) attachment to gain and honour and (c) lack of compassion.
[13] The three [obscurations] to mastery. Since mastery consists in the
attainment of all kinds of masteries of the mind, mastery is [equivalent to] Buddha-
hood105. But since the three obscurations to the latter are not known, he says: on
account of which one fails to obtain106 supremacy. He states that the obscu-
rations to mastery are those on account of which supremacy is not obtained, because
supremacy is dependent upon the mastery of mind. Furthermore, supremacy refers to
excellence in regard to direct intuition, relinquishment and power. Alternatively, by the
statement: "...those on account of which supremacy is not obtained", [supremacy] is
demonstrated as a synonym for mastery 107. What is meant is: Buddhahood 108 is not
attained. (a) The loss of what has been learnt. [This is equivalent to the total
separation from hearing the true Dharma in the same way that¹09 the loss of one's

relatives is [equivalent to the total separation from one's relatives. Furthermore, the
loss of what has been learnt is due to the arising of karmal10 conducive to the
loss of the truell1 Dharma; i.e. because they either abide in the attachment to their
own views or they have recourse to people who are not good friends, the Sūtras of the
universal vehicle are rejected by those who lack remorse saying: "these words are
spoken by Māra and are the cause of unfortunate states of existence; these words are
not spoken by the Buddha", and they deter other people from these [Sūtras]. They
efface the writings, burn and submerge them in water and so, in various ways, there is
the arising of karmal 12 conducive to the loss of the true Dharma on account of the
maturation of the 'seed' of an individual nature113 that is deprived of hearing the true
Dharma. [Alternatively], when there is no loss of what has been learnt, (b) learning
little is referred to as an obscuration since the accumulations of direct intuition are
incomplete and one who has little learning is unable to analyse the dharmas. And
[alternatively], even if one has much learning, (c) lack of the necessary prepa-
ration for meditative concentration114 is referred to as an obscuration. The lack
of the necessary preparation for meditative concentration is due to: (a) the absence of
any of [the qualities] beginning with will-power, or (b) the non-completion of medita-
tive development¹15 because of the absence of any of the eight formative forces that
facilitate relinquishment. Alternatively, the lack of necessary preparation refers to the
non-perfection of the Buddha's meditative concentrations such as the Vajra-like
[concentration]116. What are obscurations here? They are: (a) karma conducive to the
loss of the Dharma, (b) learning little, (c) weakness in wisdom and (d) the secondary
defilements that are adverse to meditative concentration such as spiritual indifference
and restlessness.
Furthermore, these obscurations in regard to virtue etc. should be
known according to the influence of each [respective] category, in

107
relation to which there are ten [instrumental] causes. The ten causes
are: (a) The cause for origination; for example, the eyes etc. [are the
cause] for eye-consciousness, (b) The cause for continued existence;
for example, the four types of food [are the cause for the continued
existence] of sentient beings. (c) The cause for support refers to that
which is the foundation of something; for example, the inanimate world
[is the cause for the support] of the world of sentient beings. (d) The
cause for manifestation; for example, sight [is the cause for the mani-
festation] of form. (e) The cause for modification; for example, fire
etc. [is the cause for the modification] of cooked food etc.
(f) The
cause for disjunction; for example, the scythe [is the cause for the dis-
junction] of that which is to be severed. (g) The cause for transfor-
mation; for example, a gold-smith etc. [is the cause for the tran for-
mation] of gold etc. when it is transformed into things such as
bracelets. (h) The cause for a belief; for example, smoke etc. [is the
cause for the belief that there is] fire etc. (i) The cause for making
[others] believe; for example, the logical reason is the cause for
making (others) believe] in a premise. (j) The cause for attainment; for
example, the path etc. [is the cause for the attainment] of nirvăpa etc.
Thus the obscuration to origination is to be regarded [as an obscu-
ration] to virtue because of the necessity for the origination of the
latter. The obscuration to continued existence is [an obscuration] to
enlightenment because of the unshakability of the latter. The obscu-
ration to support is [an obscuration] to complete acceptance because the
latter is the foundation of the resolve for enlightenment. The obscu-
ration to manifestation is [an obscuration] to the possession of intelli-
gence because of the necessity for the promulgation of the latter. The
obscuration to modification is [an obscuration] to the absence of error
because the latter changes into the reverse of error. The obscuration to
disjunction is [an obscuration] to the absence of obscuration because
the latter is [equivalent to] separation from obscuration. The obscu-
ration to transformation is [an obscuration] to development because the
latter is characterized by the transformation of mind into enlightenment.
The obscuration to belief is [an obscuration] to lack of fear because fear
is due to disbelief. The obscuration to making [others] believe is [an
obscuration] to lack of avarice because others are made to believe on
account of lack of avarice in regard to the Dharma. The obscuration to
attainment is [an obscuration] to mastery because the latter is charac-
terized by the attainment of supremacy.N33
118
In regard to origination, continued
existence, support, manifestation,
modification, disjunction, transfor-
mation, belief, making [others]
believe and attainment, the causes
are tenfold.
119
120
The examples of these begin with the
eyes, food, the ground, light and
fire;
The remainder begin with the scythe,
a craftsman, smoke, the logical cause
and the path.
118 Now, from the very beginning, on account of the desire to attain
enlightenment, the root of the wholesome should be generated. Then,
by engendering the force of the root of the wholesome, enlightenment
should be attained. Moreover, the resolve towards enlightenment is the
support for the origination of the root of the wholesome. The
bodhisattva is the [physical] basis of that resolve towards enlighten-
ment. Moreover, in order to relinquish119 erroneous inversion, the
absence of erroneous inversion is to be generated by the bodhisattva
who has secured the engendering of the force of the root of the whole-
some and who has generated the resolve towards enlightenment. Then,
all obscuration should be relinquished on the path of meditative develop-
ment on account of the absence of erroneous inversion¹20 on the path of
vision and all the roots of the wholesome should be transformed into
supreme and perfect enlightenment owing to the relinquishment of
obscuration. Then, by engendering the forces of transformation, there
should be no fear in regard to the profound and sublime Dharma teach-
ings. Thus, these Dharmas should be revealed to others in full detail by
one whose mind is devoid of fear and who sees the virtues of the
Dharmas. Following that, the bodhisattva who has secured the engen-
dering of the forces of the various virtues in this way soon arrives at
supreme and perfect enlightenment, having acquired mastery over all

dharmas. This is the sequential order of [the development of the
categories] beginning with virtue.
[Sthiramati]
[1] Furthermore, these obscurations beginning with lack of application in
regard to virtue etc., i.e. in regard to the tenfold categories concluding with
supremacy, [should be known according to the influence of each respect-
ive category], in relation to which there are ten [instrumental] causes¹21,
i.e. in relation to each category 122, beginning with origination and concluding with
attainment, there are ten causes, beginning with application123 and concluding with the
necessary preparation for meditative concentration, because they are contrary to those
obscurations. And although they are individually differentiated here, this explanation
does not differentiate [i.e. it designates them all as causes] because no distinction is
made concerning causality in regard to origination and the other [nine]. According
to the influence of each [respective] category; what is meant is: according to
the predominance of the category, such as origination. For, when there is an obstruc-
tion to the cause of the origination etc. of these [categories] such as virtue, it is
described as an obscuration to origination etc. For example, something, such as a wall
which obscures light is described as an obscuration to eye-consciousness which is the
effect of that [light]. In this way, thirty [instrumental] causes are explained 124
as the
reverse of the thirty obscurations that pertain to these ten dharmas [i.e. virtue etc.].
[2] In this respect, (a) the three causes for the origination of virtue are: applica-
tion, application in regard to worthy objects and proper application. Here now he
provides an example: for example, the eyes etc. For the eyes etc. are just causes
for the origination of consciousness, they do not cause continued existence etc.125
Therein, lack of application etc. is an immediate obstruction to application etc.126, and
indirectly, is an impediment to the origination of virtue too, on account of their mutual
relationship, thus the obscuration to origination is an obscuration to
virtue, hence he says: because of the necessity for the origination of the
latter. He shows that this is just an obscuration to origination because there is no
possibility of continued existence in regard to virtue [if it has not originated].
[3] (b) The cause for continued existence is in relation to enlightenment.
The turning about of the basis is [equivalent to] enlightenment which has thusness,

Tib. omits ādi; cf. D229b.6.Y85
110
devoid of stain, for its basis 127. Here he gives the reason: because of its unshaka-
bility. It is unshakable because it remains for the duration of the world; it cannot
become otherwise nor can it cease. However, the enlightenment of the śrävaka etc.
ceases after having accomplished its aim in his own mental continuum. The
bodhisattvas who with their superior mental disposition which consists in the
provision of welfare and happiness for all sentient beings are engaged in accumu-
lations, vow to remain [in the world] up until such time as there is the enlightenment
characterized by the turning about of the basis for [all] sentient beings ¹28; but not for
the sake of mere non-rebirth, like the śrävakas etc. 129 Moreover, since there can be no
continued existence without origination130, origination is also [applicable] here. There-
fore, just the cause for the continued existence of enlightenment is mentioned, not the
cause for origination. And since, there is no other cause for continued existence apart
from this, consequently, only the latter is mentioned. Alternatively, enlightenment is
[equivalent to] pure thusness and thusness does not originate because it has purity for
its own-being. On the contrary, only continued existence is positively mentioned by
way of these causes because of the absence of adventitious stain; origination is not
[mentioned]. Furthermore, the causes for the continued existence of enlightenment¹31
are: (a) the production of the roots 132 of the wholesome, (b) mental attention and (c)
accumulations that are complete. And while such things as the non-origination of
virtue are hindrances herein to the arising of the wholesome etc.; since they impair the
continued existence 133 of enlightenment, they are described as obscurations to its
continued existence. (b) The cause for continued existence¹34; here he gives an
example: for example, the four types of food [are the cause for the con-
tinued existence] of sentient beings, for no new sentient beings are brought
into existence by means of the [four] foods such as morsel food135, whereas those who
have already come into existence are certainly maintained 136.
[4] The cause for support refers to... The support is the resolve towards
enlightenment because it is the foundation for all wholesome dharmas. Here now is an

example: whatever is the foundation of something is indeed its support137,
considering that it is supported by this. For example, the inanimate world is
[the cause for the support] of the world of sentient beings138. The causes
for this [support] are: (a) the spiritual lineage, (b) being endowed with good friends
and (c) the absence of mental exhaustion. The deprivation of a spiritual lineage etc. is
also mentioned herein as an obscuration to support because it is at odds with the cause
for support, hence he says: the obscuration to support is [an obscuration] to
complete acceptance because the latter is the foundation of the resolve
for enlightenment.
[5] The cause for manifestation is in relation to the possession of intelli-
gence; because of the necessity for its promulgation by the bodhisattva. Moreover,
this refers to: (a) success in spiritual practice, (b) living with suitable people and (c)
living with people who are not intent upon harm 39. Since they are impediments to the
cause for the manifestation of intelligence, the deprivation of spiritual practice and the
like herein are described as obscurations to manifestation. Hence he says: the obscu-
ration to manifestation is [an obscuration] to the possession of intelli-
gence because of the necessity for the promulgation of the latter. Here
now is an example: for example, sight is [the cause for the manifestation]
of form 140; for sight141 is the cause for the manifestation of form alone, it is not the
cause for origination and the like.
[6] The cause for modification is in relation to the absence of error.
Because it has the nature of the reverse of the errors of imputation and
negation, the absence of error, which is [equivalent to the path of vision, is described
as a modification of error¹42. For example, ash etc. [is a modification] of wood etc.
The three causes of this are: (a) the eradication of disquiet that consists in erroneous
inversion, (b) the absence of the three obscurations such as moral defilement and (c)
the maturation of the wisdom which brings liberation to fruition. For example, fire
etc. [is the cause for the modification] of cooked food etc. For eatables
such as boiled rice are different from uncooked rice etc., but belong to their series. The
cause of the latter is fire etc.

112
[7] The cause for disjunction is in relation to the absence of obscu-
ration. The obscuration that remains 143 from obscuration that is to be relinquished by
means of the path of vision is relinquished on account of this, thus the absence of
obscuration refers to the path of meditative development. The three causes for the latter
are: (a) the eradication of innate disquiet, (b) vigour¹44 and (c) the absence of careless-
ness. Moreover, these are causes for disjunction because they [act as] counteragents to
the cause for non-disjunction. Hence he says: the obscuration to disjunction is
[an obscuration] to the absence of obscuration; and this is an obscuration to
just the counteragent for the cause for disjunction. Here now he gives the reason:
because the latter consists in the separation from obscuration.
Since one
is separated [from obscuration] on account of this, it is described as disjunction.
[8] The cause for transformation is in relation to development ¹45, because
the latter is characterized by application in regard to the roots of the wholesome, i.e. in
regard to universal enlightenment. Moreover, this consists in a turning aside from
existence and enjoyments and the absence of faintheartedness. Consequently, the
obscuration to transformation should be regarded as an impediment to the cause for
transformation. For what reason? Because the latter, i.e. development, is char-
acterized by the transformation of mind146 into universal enlightenment.
[9] The cause for belief is in relation to lack of fear. This consists in: (a)
the holding of people in esteem, (b) the firm conviction in the Dharma and (c) the
understanding of the meaning that is intended. Since belief is on account of these
qualities, the obscuration to belief is [an obscuration] to lack of fear¹47,
since [the latter] is an impediment to the cause for belief. Here now is the reason148:
because fear is due to disbelief because it is on account of disbelief that one has
fear of the Dharma.
[10] The cause for making [others] believe is in relation to lack of
avarice. Moreover, this consists in: (a) enthusiasm for the true Dharma, (b) indiffer-
ence towards gain and honour and veneration and (c) compassion for sentient beings.
And since it is at odds with the cause for making (others] believe, the obscuration
to making (others] believe is established as [an obscuration]149 to lack of
avarice. Here now he provides the reason: because others are made to
believe! 150
on account of lack of avarice in regard to the Dharma. Avarice

113
is created towards the Dharma due to lack of enthusiasm etc. for the true Dharma.
Moreover, one does not teach the Dharma to others because of avarice for the Dharma.
Hence the obscuration to making [others] believe is described as [an obscuration]151 to
lack of avarice.
[11] The three causes for attainment are152: (a) the absence of karma conducive to
the loss of the Dharma, (b) much learning and (c) the necessary preparation for medita-
tive concentration. Loss of what is learnt etc. is established as [an obscuration] to
mastery because it is at odds with these [causes]. Here now is the reason: because
the latter, i.e. mastery, is characterized by the attainment of supremacy.
[12] However, others say that the causes for virtue etc. have the following sequential
order. A mental continuum that is supported 153 by the wholesome dharmas is
conducive to the attainment of enlightenment; consequently, virtue is mentioned at the
beginning. Immediately after that, enlightenment is mentioned. Since [the bodhisattva)
has the ability to accomplish both of these owing to his resolve for enlightenment and
since his resolve for enlightenment is the support for all the wholesome dharmas until
[he attains] enlightenment, the resolve for enlightenment is then mentioned. When he
has generated the resolve for enlightenment he applies himself to the six perfections as
well as to the avoidance of stupid or pernicious people. In this way his status as a
bodhisattva becomes publicly manifest. Hence his possession of intelligence is
mentioned immediately after complete acceptance. And while applying himself in this
way [the bodhisattva] relinquishes erroneous inversion and produces direct intuition.
that is not erroneously inverted. Hence the absence of error is mentioned immediately
following the possession of intelligence. Moreover, this consists in the path of vision
because obscuration is relinquished through the practice thereon. Hence, immediately
after this, the absence of obscuration is mentioned which consists in the relinquishment
of obscuration. Since the mind of one who is devoid of obscuration is transformed
just into Buddhahood and not into any other [mode of being] because he is not attached
to existence and enjoyments, consequently, development is then mentioned. And thus,
elation arises towards the extremely profound Dharmas of the Buddha on the part of [a
bodhisattva] who has attained such a state of being and since he is devoid of fear, the
lack of fear is then mentioned. In this way, since one who has direct perception of the
Dharma 154
resorts only to those expedients through which he perceives correct
discipline for sentient beings, how can there be any avarice on his part? Therefore,
immediately after lack of fear, lack of avarice is mentioned. Thus the bodhisattva

whose obscurations are relinquished and whose virtuous qualities are complete155
obtains mastery of mind; hence, mastery is then mentioned. This is the sequential
order.
[13] Since this chapter is the section concerning obscuration156, the causes for the
origination of virtue etc. are not expressed in aphorisms 157 [in Maitreya's kārikās), like
the obscurations are. However, a summary of the [causes for the origination of virtue
etc.] that have presented themselves in this connection is provided here in verse
form158
The causes are tenfold in regard to
origination, continued existence,
support, manifestation, modification,

Introductory
Furthermore, the other obscurations
are in regard to: (a) the factors that
contribute [to enlightenment], (b) the
perfections and (c) the spiritual
levels.
(Verse II.10 cd is repeated)163
In the above, virtue and its obscurations were explained without any specific distinct-
ion but now he explains virtue according to its differentiation in relation to the factors
that contribute [to enlightenment] and also according to its differentiation as being
common or not common [to all spiritual lineages].

115
(a) Lack of skill in regard to the
foundation, (b) laziness, (c) the two
deficiencies in meditative concentra-
tion, (d) non-engendering, (e) excess-
ive weakness, and the defects of: (f)
false view and (g) disquiet.

(a) Lack of skill in regard to the foundation is an obscuration to the
applications of mindfulness. (b) Laziness is (an obscuration] to the
complete relinquishments. (c) The two deficiencies in meditative con-
centration are [obscurations] to the bases of psychic power, namely, (i)
[a deficiency] in completeness165 due to defectiveness in either will
power, vigour, mind or examination and (ii) [a deficiency] in meditative
development due to defectiveness in the formative forces that facilitate
relinquishment. (d) The non-engendering of [the elements] conducive
to liberation is [an obscuration] to the faculties. (e) The excessive
weakness of those faculties is [an obscuration] to the powers because
of their contamination by adverse elements. (f) The fault of false view
is [obscuration] to the limbs of enlightenment because they characterize
the path of vision. (g) The fault of disquiet is [an obscuration] to the
limbs of the path because they are nurtured by the path of meditative
development.
[Sthiramati]
Y89.16 [1] Also the obscurations pertinent to [virtuel66 which consists in the factors that
contribute to [enlightenment are explained] according to the differentiation of the latter
Y90
as:
II.11 a
(a) Lack of skill in regard to the
foundation, (b) laziness etc.
The factors that contribute to enlightenment are common in this respect because both
the śrävakas and bodhisattvas are entitled to them167 without a specific distinction [as
to activity]168. However, the perfections and the spiritual levels, which consist in the
activity pertinent to the bodhisattvas, are not common [to all] because only the
bodhisattvas have sovereign power over them. Moreover, the obscuration to the result
was previously described by way of the obscuration to the cause of virtue etc.; how-
ever, what is other than what was discussed previously is mentioned (now] since it is
the immediate obscuration to the result [that is discussed] here. Alternatively, since
such [qualities] as the lack of skill in regard to the foundation is indeed different from
the lack of application etc., this difference is discussed. Alternatively, when virtue and
enlightenment [were discussed in the previous section] the lack of application etc. to
conduct and its result, which go together with the expedients of the bodhisattvas alone,
were described as obscurations. Here in this section however, by means of an analysis

117
of the factors that contribute to enlightenment etc., the lack of skill in regard to the
foundation etc. should be understood as an obscuration to virtue, whether common or
not common [to all spiritual lineages], that is different from the lack of application etc.
Therein, enlightenment is threefold according to its differentiation among the śrāvakas
etc. and since they conform with these [three], [those qualities] beginning with the
applications of mindfulness and concluding with the path169 are described 170 as the
factors that contribute to enlightenment. The ten perfections and the ten spiritual levels
[are described] in accordance with the Sutras.
[2] Lack of skill in regard to the foundation is an obscuration to the
applications of mindfulness. Moreover, this refers to the four applications of the
mindfulness of: (a) budy, (b) sensation, (c) mind and (d) the dharmas. The body,
sensation, mind and the dharmas form the foundation of these [four applications of
mindfulness] because they have these for their object. Therein, the body forms the
foundation for notional attachment to a '[physical] basis'. Sensation forms the founda-
tion for notional attachment to the enjoyments that belong to the self. Mind forms the
foundation for notional attachment to the belief in the self. The dharmas171 form the
foundation for notional attachment to the defilement and purification of the self.
Absence of understanding in regard to the individual and general characteristics of the
body etc. is [equivalent to] lack of skill in this regard. Therein, the individual charac-
teristic of the body refers to its nature as a composite of many impure substances ¹72.
The [individual characteristic] of sensation refers to its essential nature consisting in
pleasure etc. The individual characteristic] of consciousness refers to its various
representations as sense-objects. The [individual characteristic] of the dharmas is in
accordance with the context [i.e. pure or impure]. Furthermore, the general charac-
teristic refers to the aspects such as impermanent, painful, empty and not-self. Alter-
natively, lack of skill in regard to the foundation refers either to: (a) lack of knowledge
in regard to the body etc. in its aspects as impure, painful, impermanent and without
self, or (b) conceptual differentiation [in regard to the body etc.] in terms of the aspects
of purity, pleasure, permanence and a self, because nescience or wrong view are
[respective] obscurations to the applications of mindfulness. [Objection]: If the appli-
cations of mindfulness have wisdom and mindfulness for their own-being, why is only
the lack of skill in regard to the foundation described as an obscuration but not also the
absence of memory in regard to the foundation? [Response]: Because the activity [of
mindfulness] is dependent upon wisdom; for thus, since wisdom consists in vision,

118
mindfulness etc. acts upon an objective support that is attained subsequently to wisdom
but does not exist independently, like wisdom. Therefore, the absence of memory is
not described as an obscuration in this regard.
[3] Laziness is [an obscuration] to the complete relinquishments. The
topic under discussion is the obscurations. Vigour receives the title of 'complete relin-
quishment in this context when it is occupied with: (a) the relinquishment of adverse
elements that have [already] arisen and the non-origination of those which have not yet
arisen, and (b) the augmentation of the counteragent that has [already] arisen and the
production of those which have not yet arisen. Although the latter cannot be differen-
tiated, they are respectively determined as fourfold due to the differentiation in
result. 173 Consequently, since the complete relinquishments consist in vigour, sloth-
fulness is described as an obscuration.
[4] The two deficiencies in meditative concentration are [obscurations]
to the bases of psychic power. It is described as psychic power (rddhi) since
[the bodhisattva] becomes successful (rdhyate) by means of this. Moreover, it consists
in the meditative concentrations of will-power, vigour, mind and examination. This is
the base of psychic power because it is the support for the psychic powers such as
travelling 174 through space and [the performance of] magical creations. Alternatively,
psychic power (rddhi) is [equivalent to] moving (ardana)175; what is meant is: a power
such as traveling through space. The bases of these are the bases of psychic power
because they form its foundation. The latter refers to meditative concentration and is of
four kinds beginning with the meditative concentration of will-power. Will-power is
the essential feature in this meditative concentration of will-power because one attains
meditative concentration by means of it. However, it is not that vigour and the others
are absent therein for they do accompany will-power, but since they are not essential
features in the latter [i.e. in the chandasamadhi], they are not proclaimed. The same
should be said for the meditative concentrations of vigour, mind and examination. The
two deficiencies in meditative concentration were described as obscurations and since
these are not known, he says: namely, (a) [a deficiency] in completeness 176
due to defectiveness in either will-power, vigour, mind or examination
and (b) [a deficiency] in meditative development due to defectiveness in
the formative forces that facilitate relinquishment. The deficiency in com-
pleteness in this regard is due to the absence of any one of: will-power, vigour, mind
and examination, because meditative concentration does not occur due to the power of

178
that [absence] 177. As to the deficiency in meditative development, this is due to the
absence of any one of the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment. More-
over, the latter have the nature of faith, will-power, vigour, tranquillity, mindfulness,
full awareness, volition and equanimity Since mastery in meditative concentration
is obtained by means of the meditative development of these formative forces that
facilitate relinquishment and not by any other means, hence, because there is a
deficiency in meditative development due to their absence, mastery over meditative
development is not obtained. What are the obscurations here? (a) That which is
adverse to will-power etc. and (b) secondary defilement that is adverse to the formative
forces which facilitate relinquishment, namely, laziness, forgetfulness in regard to an
objective support, indolence, excitability, the absence of formative force and the
[presence of] formative force.
[5] The non-engendering of [the elements] conducive to liberation is [an
obscuration] to the faculties. The root of the wholesome which one who is
afraid of samsāra179 produces for the sake of liberation is described as 'conducive to
liberation' since the assurance of obtaining liberation is on account of that. And since
faith etc. receive the title of 'faculties' when it is engendered and not otherwise, hence ¹80
the non-engendering of [the roots of the wholesome] that are conducive to liberation is
described as the obscuration to the faculties. What are the obscurations here? They are
that: (a) attachment to a new existence and (b) fear in regard to nirvana. [which occur
when the root of the wholesome] which is conducive to liberation is not generated on
account of any secondary defilement 181.
[6] The excessive weakness of those faculties is [an obscuration] to the
powers. The topic under discussion is obscuration. 182 How then can there be an
excessive weakness of the faculties? Consequently, he says: because of their
184
contamination ¹83 by adverse elements; what is meant is: they are overcome
by adverse elements which have the nature of lack of faith, laziness, loss of mindful-
ness, distraction and a weakness in wisdom 185. The faculties are nurtured by the state

A Sanskrit fragment of a portion of the Tika (Y92.15 to 93.9) was discovered among
Vinitadeva's Trimsika-tika and published by P.S. Jaini in an article titled "The Sanskrit
Fragments of Vinitadeva's Trimsika-çīka" in BSOAS Vol. XLVIII/3, 1985, pp.470-92; cf. fn.96
p.492. This fragment has been used as basis for several of the following emendations.

of 'heat' and the state of the 'summit'186; and although these two [states] are conducive
to penetration, they become excessively weak because they are overcome by adverse
elements such as lack of faith. Hence there is the possibility of loss through that187.
However faith and the like receive the title of 'powers' in the states 188 of the 'receptivity
to knowledge and the highest [worldly]189 realization' because the adverse elements
have been vanquished. Hence whatever excessive weakness there is in those
[faculties] such as faith, when they are overcome by adverse elements in the states of
'heat' and the 'summit'190, that is an obstruction to the powers because when it exists
there is no possibility of a condition of power191. What are the obscurations here?
Just those adverse [elements] such as lack of faith.
[7] The fault of false view is [an obscuration] to the limbs of enlight-
enment. The fact that obscuration [is the subject under discussion] remains in force
here ¹92, Enlightenment here is intended as [equivalent to the path of vision and since
these seven limbs of enlightenment which have the nature of mindfulness, the investi-
gation of the Dharma, vigour, joy, tranquillity, meditative concentration and equanimity
arise at the time of the relinquishment of moral defilement that is to be relinquished by
means of [the path of] vision, they are described as the limbs of the latter¹93 [i.e. of
enlightenment]. However, if they were [described as] limbs because they are
favourable to enlightenment then the applications of mindfulness and the like would
also be limbs of enlightenment. How can the fault of false view be an obscuration to
the limbs of enlightenment? Hence he says: because they are nurtured by the
path of vision; what is meant is: because they are respectively determined by the
path of vision. What then is this fault of false view? (a) The five imaginary views, (b)
doubt, (c) ignorance, (d) the moral defilements and secondary defilements together
with their associates such as passion, which have the latter [i.e. a, b & c] for their
objective support. [Objection]: Is it not so that doubt and the like are also obscurations
in this respect? [Response]: Admittedly these are obscurations, however, here194 he

annunciates the fault of false view 195 by laying the stress on its essential features, thus
the absence of an exposition of these [elements, i.e. doubt etc.] is not contradictory.
Moreover, of these [elements] beginning with false view, it is just the 'seed' lodged in
the store-consciousness that is described as an obscuration to those [limbs of enlight-
enment] because it is to be relinquished 196 by means of the path of vision.
[8] The fault of disquiet is mentioned as the obscuration to the limbs of the
path, which are enumerated as: correct view, correct intention, correct speech, correct
action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness and correct meditative
concentration 197. Here now he provides the reason: because those limbs of the path
are characterized by the path of meditative development, because they are
respectively determined by the path of meditative development. What is the fault of
disquiet? In detail it refers to: (a) the innate false views of individuality and grasping
of extremes together with their associated elements and (b) the moral defilements and
secondary defilements of passion etc. together with their associated elements, which
have the former [i.e. (a)] as well as the sense-objects for their objective supports. The
'seed' of these, which is lodged in the store-consciousness, is disquiet. However, in
brief, it refers to the impurities other than those which are to be relinquished by means
of [the path of] vision. The force of those [impurities], which is lodged in the store-
consciousness, is disquiet. Moreover, this is determined as an obscuration to the limbs
of the path since it is to be relinquished by means of the path of meditative develop-
ment. The obscuration to the factors that contribute to enlightenment has now been
described.
b. The Obscurations to the Perfections.
The obscurations to the perfections are:
II.12 abcd
Obscurations to: (a) dominion, (b)
propitious states of existence, (c) the
non-abandonment of sentient beings,
(d) the diminution of faults and aug-
mentation of virtues, (e) guidance;

197
Ms.(27b.4) line begins: -ksamadhy...; which suggests that each of the eight limbs of the path
should be prefixed by samyak, although Tib. substantiates Y's rendering which omits samyak;
cf. D234b.2-3.Y94.6

[Sthiramati]
(f) liberation, (g) imperishability, (h)
the continuity of virtue, (i) the assur-
ance of [the arising of the latter] and
(j) enjoyment of the Dharma and
causing maturation.
Here the obscurations that pertain to the ten perfections are shown
by way of the particular obscuration to the relevent result of each
perfection. Of these, (a) the obscuration to dominion and sovereignty
is an obscuration [to the result]198 of the perfection of generosity. (b)
The obscuration to propitious states of existence is [an obscuration to
the result of the perfection of morality. (c) be obscuration to the
non-abandonment of sentient beings is [an obscuration to the result] of
the perfection of patience. (d) The obscuration to the diminution of
faults and the augmentation of virtues is [an obscuration to the result]
of the perfection of vigour. (e) The obscuration to the guidance of
those to be trained is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of
the meditative absorptions. (f) The obscuration to liberation is [an
obscuration to the result of the perfection of wisdom. (g) The obscu-
ration to the imperishability of generosity etc. is [an obscuration to the
result of the perfection of skill in regard to expedients because its
imperishability is on account of the transformation into enlightenment.
(h) The obscuration to the uninterrupted emergence of the wholesome in
all rebirths is [an obscuration to the result of the perfection of vows
because the possession of a rebirth that is favourable to this is on
account of the strength of vows. (i) The obscuration to the assurance
[of the arising] of those wholesome [elements] is [an obscuration to the
result] of the perfection of the powers because [the bodhisattva] is not
overcome by adverse elements on account of his powers of critical
consideration and meditative development. () The obscuration to both
the enjoyment of the Dharma for himself and causing the maturation of
others is an obscuration [to the result of the perfection of direct intu-
ition because the understanding [by the bodhisattva] of the meaning of
what he has learnt is not in accord with the letter.
198
122
[1] Immediately following the latter [i.e. the obscurations to the factors that contribute
to enlightenment], [the obscurations] to the perfections should be mentioned. Hence he
Tib. (D9a.2) inserts bras bu which is not found in the Ms.Y95
says: the obscurations to the perfections are:
II.12 ab
199
Obscurations to: (a) dominion, (b)
propitious states of existence, (c) the
non-abandonment of sentient
199
beings! etc.
Here the obscurations that pertain to the ten perfections are shown by
way of the particular obscuration to the relevent result of each perfec-
tion. What is the reason that here avarice and the like, which exist substantially as
impediments 200 to generosity etc., are not described as obscurations to the perfections
although they are [described as] obscurations to the result of the relevent (perfection]?
All [people] engage in generosity and the like for the sake of its result201; therefore, in
order to generate interest in the relinquishment of avarice etc., the obscuration to the
result is mentioned but the obscuration to the perfection not. Alternatively, obscura-
tion such as avarice which is adverse to dominion and which produces a result
consisting in poverty etc., impedes a result such as dominion202, thus it is described as
an obscuration to the latter. What are the results of those [perfections]? In this
respect the chief results of the perfection of generosity are dominion and
sovereignty. The [chief result] of the perfection of morality is a propitious state
of existence. The [chief result] of the perfection of patience is the non-aban-
donment of sentient beings. The [chief result] of the perfection of vigour is the
diminution of faults and the augmentation of virtues. The [chief result] of the
perfection of meditative absorption is guidance for sentient beings in scriptural
instruction. The [chief result] of the perfection of wisdom is liberation for those
who have been guided203. The [chief result] of the perfection of skill in regard
to expedients is the imperishability of the wholesome on account of its transfor-
mation into enlightenment. The [chief result] of the perfection of vows is uninter-
rupted virtue. The [chief result] of the perfection of the powers is the assurance
[of the arising] of wholesome dharmas. The [chief result] of the perfection of
direct intuition is the enjoyment of the Dharma and the maturation of sentient
beings.

[2] The obscuration to dominion and sovereignty204; therein, dominion refers
to an abundance of wealth and property. Sovereignty refers to the power that comes
from the enjoyment of the latter. The obscuration to these two is an obscuration
pertinent to the perfection of generosity because they result from that. What then is this
[obscuration]? It is avarice.
[3] The obscuration to the propitious states of existence; a propitious state
of existence refers to an excellent state of existence either among mankind or the
gods205. The obscuration to this is an obscuration pertinent to the perfection of moral-
ity because [propitious states of existence] result from that. Moreover, this
[obscuration] consists in: (a) immorality and (b) contemptible actions of body and
speech.
[4] [The obscuration] to the non-abandonment of sentient beings; i.e.
treating [even] offensive sentient beings just like those who are helpful. And this is the
result of [the perfection of 206 patience; the obscuration to this is anger.
[5] [The obscuration] to the diminution of faults and the augmentation
of virtues; the diminution of faults refers to the relinquishment of [elements] that
have already arisen which cause harm to oneself and others and the non-origination of
[elements] that have not yet arisen. The augmentation [of virtues]207 refers to the
growth of [elements] that have already arisen which manifest for the benefit of oneself
and others and the origination of [elements] that have not yet arisen. What then is the
obscuration here? It is laziness.
[6] The obscuration to the guidance of those to be trained...; i.e. guidance
in scriptural instruction for those to be trained because it is acknowledged as the cause
for the attainment of the heavens and final beatitude. When respect is produced
through appeasement, sentient beings effortlessly understand the scriptural instruction
on account of: (a) reading the thoughts of others, (b) their psychic power208; and
distraction is the obscuration here.
[7] The obscuration to liberation; liberation consists in the relinquishment of
moral defilement and this comes about through scriptural instruction209. Since
scriptural instruction comes about on account of wisdom and not by any other means,

consequently, liberation is the result of the perfection of wisdom. The obscurations to
this are: (a) defiled wisdom, (b) delusion and (c) a weakness in wisdom.
[8] The obscuration to the imperishability of generosity etc.210; an obscu-
ration to the imperishability of generosity and morality etc. is an obscuration pertinent
to the perfection of expedients. Moreover, as to how generosity etc. can be imperish-
able, he says: because its imperishability is on account of the transfor-
mation into enlightenment. The root of the wholesome such as generosity which
is transformed into universal enlightenment, like Buddhahood, does not perish,. Some
believe that this obscuration consists in a lack of knowledge of the expedients which
characterize the transformation into universal enlightenment. Others believe that this
obscuration consists in the grasping of the three components [of giving]211 which is
[equivalent to] lack of skill in regard to expedients.
[9] The obscuration to the uninterrupted 212 emergence of the wholesome
in all rebirths; the uninterrupted [emergence] of the wholesome is [equivalent to its
emergence] day by day or moment by moment. And this is the result of the perfection
of vows. As to why this is so, he says: because the possession²
213 of rebirth
that is favourable to this is on account of the strength of vows; for [the
bodhisattva] takes a rebirth that is congenial to the uninterrupted emergence of
generosity etc. through the strength of his vows. Obscuration to this consists in the
absence of vows in relation to a rebirth favourable to generosity etc.
[10] The obscuration to the assurance214 [of the arising] of those whole-
some [elements]; assurance consists in the combining [of the three: vīrya, samadhi
and prajñāļ215 day by day and moment by moment. Here now he gives the reason:
because [the bodhisattva] is not overcome by adverse [elements] on
account of his powers of critical consideration and meditative develop-
ment. The power of critical consideration here consists in wisdom accompanied by
steadfastness. Furthermore, steadfastness is a designative dharma since it is a designa-
tion applicable to the innate trio of vigour216, meditative concentration and wisdom.
The power of meditative development [is mentioned here] because [the bodhisattva)
engages in generosity etc., effortlessly, through his possession of habitual practice

because he is not overcome by avarice which is the counteragent to this [power of
meditative development]. What are the obscurations here? (a) The absence of critical
consideration217 and (b) weakness in meditative development.
[11] The obscuration to the enjoyment of the Dharma for himself and
causing the maturation of others; the results are: (a) the enjoyment of the
profound and sublime Dharma of the universal vehicle by one who is situated in the
circles of the assembly which pertain to enjoyment218 and (b) causing the maturation 219
of sentient beings through teaching the Dharma by acts of transformation in their
various aspects220. Moreover, the obscurations to this are: (a) deliberation upon the
meaning of what has been learnt, according to the letter221 and (b) sluggish wisdom.
And so ends the obscurations [to the perfections].
[12] Although, substantially there are six perfections herein, nominally there are ten²22
since four perfections are constituted by the perfection of wisdom. The perfection of
wisdom therein consists in supramundane direct intuition devoid of conceptual differ-
entiation; the gradual relinquishment of all obscuration is on account of that direct
intuition. Furthermore, the perfections of expedients, vows, the powers and direct
intuition are incorporated in direct intuition that is attained subsequently to the supra-
mundane path. How is it that the perfection of direct intuition, although it is pre-
eminent, is not devoid of conceptual differentiation? Because the perfection of direct
intuition consists in that direct intuition attained subsequently to the direct intuition that
is devoid of conceptual differentiation and after precisely defining his understanding by
means of that direct intuition223, [the bodhisattva] experiences in return the enjoyment
of the Dharma for himself and brings others to maturation. And since this duality [i.e.
self/others subject/object] is non-existent in [direct intuition] devoid of conceptual
differentiation, consequently, the perfection of direct intuition is not without conceptual
differentiation. The obscurations to the perfections have now been described.

c. The Obscurations to the Spiritual Levels.
Moreover, [the obscurations] to the spiritual levels are, respectively:
In regard to: (a) the meaning as all-
pervading, (b) the meaning as pre-
eminent, (c) the meaning as pre-
eminent that flows out, (d) the
meaning as devoid of possession, (e)
[the meaning] as non-differentiation
in mental continuum.

(f) The meaning as devoid of defile-
ment and purification, (g) the mean-
ing as devoid of multiplicity, (h) the

127
This ignorance concerning the
dharmadhātu, being a tenfold obscu-
ration which is undefiled, [acts] in
opposition to the ten spiritual levels.
However, the spiritual levels are the
counteragents.
Concerning the dharmadhãātu, there is undefiled nescience in regard
to the tenfold meaning, such as all-pervading, which is an obscuration
to the ten respective spiritual levels of the bodhisattva because it is
adverse to each of them, namely, "in regard to the meaning as all-
pervading" 224 [and so on as above]. For, (a) by means of the first
spiritual level [the bodhisattva] penetrates the sense of all-pervading on
the part of the dharmadhātu; on account of this he obtains in return [the
realization] that self and others are equal. (b) By means of the second
[he penetrates] its meaning as pre-eminent. On account of this he
believes: "therefore then, in regard to equality in achievement,
endeavour should be directed by us towards only the achievement of
complete purification in every way"225. (c) By means of the third [he
penetrates] the meaning as pre-eminent that flows out of that
[dharmadhātu]. On account of this, after understanding the pre-eminent
224 sarvatragarthe is omitted from the Tib.; cf. D9b.2.

128
nature of what is learnt and which flows out of the dharmadhatu, he
may cast himself into a fire-pit the size of the great trichiliocosm for the
sake of them. (d) By means of the fourth [he penetrates] its meaning as
devoid of possession, for thus, even his craving for the Dharma is
checked. (e) By means of the fifth [he penetrates] its meaning as non-
differentiation in mental continuum by reason of the ten equalities in
regard to the purity of mind and mental disposition. (f) By means of
the sixth [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of defilement and purity
as the consequence of his penetration [of the reality] that, regarding the
[meaning] 226 of dependent origination, there is no dharma whatsoever
that is defiled or purified. (g) By means of the seventh [he penetrates]
its meaning as devoid of multiplicity because of the absence of the
manifestation of multiplicity by way of sign in the dharmas of the
Sutras etc. on account of their signlessness. (h) By means of the eighth
[he penetrates] its meaning as neither diminished nor increased as the
consequence of his acquisition of patient acceptance in regard to non-
originating dharmas since, in regard to defilement and purification, he
fails to perceive either the diminution or augmentation of any dharma
whatsoever 227. (i) Mastery is fourfold: (a) mastery over the absence of
conceptual differentiation, (b) mastery over the complete purification of
the field, (c) mastery over direct intuition and (d) mastery over karma.
In this respect, by means of just the eighth spiritual level he penetrates
[the reality that the dharmadhātu forms the basis of the first and
second masteries. On the ninth [he penetrates the reality that it forms
the basis for mastery over direct intuition due to his acquisition of
analytical knowledge. On the tenth [he penetrates the reality that it
forms the basis for mastery over karma as the consequence of his
working for the welfare of sentient beings at will through his creative
transformations.

In this respect there are ten spiritual levels: (1) The Joyous, (2) The Stainless, (3) The
Radiance Giving, (4) The Brilliant, (5) The Very Difficult to Conquer, (6) The Face to
Face, (7) The Far Reaching, (8) The Immovable, (9) The Good Discernment and (10)
The Cloud of the Dharma. The particular stages of understanding in regard to the
dharmadhātu in the sense of all-pervading etc. are described as the spiritual levels in
their nature as: (a) a locus for ever increasing understanding230 and (b) the foundation
for virtues that have arisen from the latter. Others believe that in whichever state
(vihāra) the bodhisattva dwells (viharati) for an extended period in regard to [his
understanding] of the dharmadhātu in the sense of all-pervading etc., by virtue of the
fact that he abides in that particular state it is called a spiritual level. Furthermore, the
arrangement of the spiritual levels231 [is as follows]: On the Joyous, the bodhisattva
achieves the direct realization of the Dharma due to the arising of the path of vision.
On the Stainless, [the bodhisattva] who has achieved the direct realization of the
Dharma232 accomplishes a special training consisting in a superior morality that flows
spontaneously because of his abstention from the immorality that stems from all subtle
transgressions. On the Radiance Giving, he accomplishes a special training that
consists in a superior mentality in regard to both the Dharma and karma that does not
cease even in other rebirths. On the Brilliant, the Very Difficult to Conquer and the
Face to Face [levels] he accomplishes a special training consisting in a superior
wisdom which has for its objective support: (a) the factors that contribute to enlight-
enment, (b) the [noble] truths and (c) dependent origination. These latter trainings
should be understood to have four kinds of result on the [four] remaining spiritual
levels: Of these, on the Far Reaching he accomplishes with effort233 the state of the
direct intuition of the signless. On the Immovable, he accomplishes without effort the
state of the direct intuition of the signless together with the purification of the 'field'.
On the Good Discernment, he accomplishes the special quality of analytical knowledge
and it is on account of this that he preaches the Dharma234. On the Cloud of the

Dharma [level] he achieves the special qualities of meditative concentration and [the
knowledge of] mystical formulae.
[2] Concerning the dharmadhātu,...in regard to the tenfold meaning
such as all-pervading, 235... The sense of all-pervading etc. in regard to the
dharmadhātu is understood by way of the ten spiritual levels of the bodhisattva.
Undefiled nescience in regard to that [meaning] is a tenfold obscuration to the
ten respective spiritual levels of the bodhisattva because it is adverse to
each of them, i.e. because it is adverse to each of the spiritual levels; for the spiritual
levels consist in special states236 of supramundane meditative concentration and
wisdom etc. Undefiled nescience is adverse [to these states] because it impedes their
arising. Moreover, it is not just undefiled nescience that is an obscuration in this
context, on the contrary, other moral defilements and secondary defilements are
[obscurations] as well. For thus, everything on the Joyous [level] to be relinquished
by the path of vision is an obscuration because all propensities for wrong insight in
regard to the [noble] truths are relinquished by the path of vision which brings about
an understanding237 of the sense of all-pervading. Furthermore, those [propensities] to
be relinquished through meditative development [are done so] by way of the remaining
spiritual levels. However, those [propensities] that have not been relinquished are just
like the ones that have been relinquished since they do not cause defilement on the part
of the bodhisattvas. With reference to this very matter, a verse has been composed:
Moral defilement becomes a limb of
enlightenment for one who employs the
mighty expedients and even samsāra has the
nature of appeasement. Consequently, the
tathāgata is inconceivable.
Moreover, because of the statement: "on the ten spiritual levels the ten perfections are
successively more excellent", it is evident that there is also the successive relinquish-
ment of those elements, beginning with avarice, which are adverse to each [level].
[Objection]: If other238 moral defilement may also be an obscuration, why is only
undefiled nescience described as the obscuration to the spiritual levels? [Response]:
Because it is not common to everyone since it acts as an impediment239 to the attain-
ment of nirvāṇa only for bodhisattvas, but not for śrävakas etc. Thus, the śrävakas and
pratyekabuddhas become liberated in spite of its [i.e. undefiled nescience's] presence,

but not the bodhisattva; hence, it is not common to all. However, since moral defile-
ment applies equally to bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc., the fact that [undefiled
nescience] is an obscuration is not annulled even though there is no mention of it [in
other works] since it is not posited nor rejected as an obscuration to the spiritual levels
of the bodhisattva, considering that it is described as an obscuration to the spiritual
levels and that it is not the only obscuration to the spiritual levels. Others say that since
undefiled nescience pertains equally to the bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc., it is
mentioned especially as an obscuration to the spiritual levels; however, moral defile-
ment follows as a consequence therefore it is not mentioned. [Reply]: Although moral
defilement is indeed equally applicable to the bodhisattvas and śrävakas etc. it therefore
need not necessarily follow. Others again believe240 that although the obscuration
consisting in the nescience of the spiritual levels is an undefiled nescience pertinent to
the śrävakas, it does not act as an impediment to liberation because the śrävakas
become liberated even though the nescience in regard to the spiritual levels is present.
However, [such a nescience] is defiled for the bodhisattva since it is the cause of an
impediment to the attainment of nirvana.
[3] Others believe this is not so:
II.16b
Being a tenfold obscuration that is
undefiled.
Because, by means of the first spiritual level [the bodhisattva] pene-
trates the sense of all-pervading on the part of the dharmadhātu.
Therein, the first spiritual level refers to the first supramundane wisdom, together with
its associated elements and is incorporated in the path of vision. The dharmadhatu is
[equivalent to] emptiness since, by virtue of its being a universal characteristic, it is in
one place just as it is everywhere. It is all-pervading because it extends everywhere.
The statement: "since no dharma is to be found outside the dharmadhâtu"241, shows
that the dharmadhātu is all-pervading. By "penetrates" is meant: 'realizes'. On
account of that242 penetration he obtains in return [the realization] that self
and others are equal243. As the consequence of his insight into the fact that the
emptiness in regard to self and others cannot be differentiated, he reflects upon the fact
that self and others are not different [thinking]: "what is self is other", or "what is other
is self". It is only because of this that the perfection of generosity is more excellent on
this spiritual level, consequently, on this [level] the bodhisattva is just as occupied with

benefit for others as with benefit for himself. Herein are shown: (a) penetration244, (b)
the counteragent and (c) the result of the counteragent; this triad should be discerned in
relation to the other spiritual levels as well.
(4] By means of the second [he penetrates] its meaning as foremost; the
fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharmadhātu is understood. This is due to
his vision of its intrinsic luminosity. On account of that he believes:
"therefore then, in regard to equality in achievement245, endeavour
should be directed by us towards only the achievement of complete
purification in every way"; he demonstrates scriptural tradition by this statement
for it is said in the [Daśabhūmika] Sūtra:
Because, when these246 ten wholesome paths of action are cultivated in the
aspect of wisdom, ...they lead up to the śrävaka vehicle. Then, when they are
purified to a greater degree, ...they lead up to the pratyekabuddha vehicle. Then,
when they are purified even more247, ...they lead to: (a) the complete purity of
the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva, (b) the complete purity 248 of the perfec-
tions and (c) extensiveness in courses. Then, when they are purified to a
greater degree, they lead up to the force of the ten powers 249 since they are
completely purified in every way250... Therefore then, in regard to equality in
achievement [endeavour should be directed by us...].251
The words "therefore then etc." signify that since [the bodhisattva] has this thought on
the second spiritual level, therefore it is known that he penetrates the meaning [of the
dharmadhatu] as foremost by way of the second [level]. "Achievement" is [equivalent
to] effort or deed. "Complete purification in every way" is [equivalent to] the removal
of both defiled and undefiled delusion in regard to the dharmadhātu. Consequently,
the perfection of morality is more excellent on this spiritual level because the self
becomes, still more so, a fit vessel252 [for purity 1253 on account of the desire for the
pre-eminent meaning [of the dharmadhātu].

[5] By means of the third [he penetrates the meaning as pre-eminent
that flows out of that [dharmadhātu]. That he penetrates it is understood,
because the statements of the Buddha are characterized by their penetration of the
dharmadhâtu; for thus254, the Dharma teachings such as the Sūtras which flow out of
the dharmadhātu are characterized by the power of the dharmadhātu known as the
Dharma Body which is completely pure in every way. This is because of both the pre-
eminent nature of the Dharma teachings that flow out of that255 [dharmadhātu] and also
the fact that they [i.e. the Dharma teachings] are the cause of the complete purification
of the dharmadhâtu on account of the pre-eminent nature of the dharmadhatu. On
account of that256, after understanding the pre-eminent nature of what is
learnt and which flows out of the dharmadhātu...; by "on account of that" 257,
[is meant]: on account of the penetration of the dharmadhatu; by "what is learnt" [is
meant]: the Dharma such as the Sūtras that are learnt; by "after understanding the pre-
eminent nature of that", is meant: after having gained knowledge of them introspec-
tively as such through direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation; ...for the
sake of them, i.e. for the sake of hearing the statements of the Buddha, he may
cast himself into the fire-pit the size of the great trichiliocosm, for it is
said in a Sutra: 258
If someone were to say the following 259: "Thus I would proclaim to you this
portion of the Dharma presented by the Perfectly Enlightened One which
facilitates complete purification in the conduct of the bodhisattva if you were to
throw 260
yourself into the great fire-pit which blazes up261 into a single flame
and you should take upon your own body the great262 suffering of the sensation
of pain". This person would think: "I would even attempt to cast myself from
the Brahma-world into the great trichiliocosm world sphere263 filled with fire264

nary fire-pit. Moreover265, associating with all the sufferings of the hells and
places of woe266 we should seek all1267 the Buddha Dharmas, even at the price
of associating with [just] human suffering".
It is because of this that the perfection of patience is more excellent on this spiritual
level since [the bodhisattva] endures all moral defilement268 for the sake of what is
learnt.
[6] By means of the fourth [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of
possession 269. It is understood that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharma-
dhātu. On the fourth spiritual level, because of its evenness, he penetrates [the
meaning] of the dharmadhātu as an absence of what pertains to the self, since there is
no sense of 'mine' whatsoever on the part of the dharmadhātu270. Alternatively, [the
dharmadhātu] is not in the possession of anyone because it is not an object of all
erroneous inversion; since it is free from erroneous inversion in itself, there is no
possession whatsoever on its behalf. For thus271, even his craving for the
Dharma is checked; this is a statement from scriptural tradition. In this way, due to
his understanding of the dharmadhātu272 through direct intuition free from conceptual
elaboration, he acquires the dharmas consisting in the factors that contribute to enlight-
enment on the Brilliant [level] and even that craving for the Dharma of the Sūtras etc.
which existed previously on the part of the bodhisattva, is checked. Others believe that
the craving for the Dharma refers to meditative absorption, meditative concentration
and the attainments. Therefore, on this spiritual level the perfection of vigour is more
excellent because [the bodhisattva] dwells perpetually in company with the factors that
contribute to enlightenment273 when both speech and discursive thought have been
transcended. 274
[7] By means of the fifth [he penetrates] its meaning as non-differen-
tiation in mental continuum275; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of

the dharmadhātu that is referred to. He sees the mutual276 sameness of non-differen-
tiation277 between himself and the mental continuum of all the Buddhas, the Venerable
Ones 278, of the past, present and future as well as that of the bodhisattvas. By reason
of the ten equalities in regard to the purity of mind and mental disposi-
tion279; he demonstrates scriptural tradition by this statement. [The full passage reads
as follows]:280
By reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning
the Dharma of the Buddhas of the past, by reason of equality in regard to the
purity of mental disposition concerning the Dharma of the Buddhas of the
future281, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition
concerning the Dharma of the Buddhas of the present, by reason of equality in
regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning morality, by reason of
equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning mind 282,
by
reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the
removal of false view, doubt, perplexity and annoyance, by reason of equality
in regard to the purity of mental disposition concerning the knowledge of what
is the path and what is not the path, by reason of equality in regard to the purity
of mental disposition concerning the knowledge of spiritual practice and
renunciation283, by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental disposi-
tion concerning the ever increasing development of all dharmas that contribute
to enlightenment284 and by reason of equality in regard to the purity of mental
disposition concerning the maturation of all sentient beings 285.
[The bodhisattva] penetrates 286 the non-differentiation in mental continuum by reason
of these equalities because the Dharma Body, which is characterized287 by a turning
about of the store-consciousness, is undifferentiated. Therefore, on this spiritual level
the perfection of meditative absorption is more excellent due to the abundance of
meditative development in regard to the aspects of the [noble] truths, in an absolute
sense.

[8] By means of the sixth [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of
defilement and purity; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharma-
dhātu that is referred to. The characteristic of dependent origination is defilement. The
[dharmadhātu] is not intrinsically defiled because [defilement] is adventitious to it, nor
is it purified because it is intrinsically pure. Thus he penetrates the dharmadhātu in the
form of being understood in himself through direct intuition that is free from
conceptual differentiation. Here now he demonstrates scriptural tradition: as the
consequence of his penetration2 288 [of the reality] that, regarding depend-
ent origination, there is no dharma whatsoever that is defiled or
purified. On the sixth spiritual level the bodhisattva analyses dependent origination
and penetrates [the reality] in regard to the latter that no dharma whatsoever is defiled
or purified, because: (a) the dharmadhātu is luminous by nature, (b) defilement is only
pertinent to the limbs of dependent origination and (c) with the exception of the latter289
there exists no other self or what pertains to a self in regard to which defilement or
purity can be construed. It is only because of this that290 the perfection of wisdom is
more excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva] understands the
profoundness of dependent origination in the sense of the absence of defilement and
purity.
[9] By means of the seventh [he penetrates] its meaning as devoid of
multiplicity; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the dharmadhātu that is
referred to. On this spiritual level the bodhisattva is victorious due to the absence of
the manifestation of all signs. And since multiplicity manifests by way of the mani-
festation of signs, hence it is said that by means of the seventh [level] he penetrates the
meaning of the dharmadhātu as devoid of multiplicity due to the absence of the mani-
festation of signs. In order to demonstrate this very meaning, he says: because of
the absence of the manifestation of multiplicity by way of sign in the
dharmas of the Sūtras etc291. Up to the sixth spiritual level [the bodhisattva]
enters the dharmadhātu by means of the signs of the dharmas [explained in the Sūtras
etc., [signs] which manifest themselves forcefully in their diversity as the [two] know-
ledges, i.e. that which consists in the entry into [the dharmadhātu] and that which is
obtained subsequently to the latter. However, on the seventh spiritual level, since he
penetrates [the reality] of the absence of sign on the part of the dharmadhātu through
direct intuition in the aspect of the uniformity of all signs, those signs do not become
manifest. Consequently, on this spiritual level the perfection of expedients is more

excellent since he penetrates [the reality] that all signs are signless and does not contra-
dict conventional linguistic usage which is created by signs. Also, as the consequence
of his penetration of the latter, in this [level] he obtains supremacy 292
[10] By means of the eighth [he penetrates] its meaning as neither
diminished nor increased 293; it is the fact that he penetrates [this meaning] of the
dharmadhatu that is referred to, since the dharmadhātu is completely pure by nature
because there is no difference between its stained or stainless condition. It is because
of this that it is described as thusness (tathata)considering that it is eternally just thus
(tathā). Even though it is devoid of sign it does not diminish294; even though it
possesses sign it does not increase 295; for thus some believe that the sign itself is sign-
less. Here now he gives the reason: as the consequence of his acquisition of
patient acceptance in regard to non-originating dharmas. Thus, on the
eighth spiritual level the bodhisattva penetrates the fact that there is neither diminution
nor increase on the part of the dharmadhatu because he acquires patient acceptance in
regard to non-originating dharmas. In regard to defilement and purification,
there is neither a diminution nor augmentation of any dharmas whatso-
ever296, because there can be no origination of new dharmas.
[11] Mastery is fourfold: (a) mastery over the absence of conceptual
differentiation, (b) mastery over the complete purification of the 'field',
(c) mastery over direct intuition and (d) mastery over karma. Because of
the spontaneous absence of the manifestation of all signs therein, the dharmadhātu is to
be known as the basis for mastery over direct intuition297 devoid of conceptual differ-
entiation. Even on the seventh [level] the non-manifestation of signs is possible by
way of formative influence; however, here [on the eighth level] [it is possible] by way
of the absence of formative influence [i.e. spontaneously 1298 that is the difference.
Also, by means of the eighth [he penetrates the reality] that it is the
basis for mastery over the complete purification of the 'field'; the topic under
discussion is the fact that he penetrates [this reality] of the dharmadhātu 299. The

138
dharmadhātu is to be understood as the basis for mastery over the complete purifi-
cation of the 'field' because [the bodhisattva] obtains the power to exhibit it at will to
the Buddha fields and the circles of assembly 300. Therefore, the perfection of vows is
more excellent on this spiritual level due to continual endeavour in regard to the whole-
some on account of the acquisition of mastery over both the absence of conceptual
differentiation and the 'field'.
[12] By means of the ninth 301 [he penetrates the reality] that it forms the
basis for mastery over direct intuition; the topic under discussion is the fact
that he penetrates [this reality] of the dharmadhatu. How is this discerned that [the
bodhisattva] penetrates [the dharmadhātu) as the basis for mastery over direct intuition
by the ninth [level]? Due to his acquisition of analytical knowledge³02.
Since, on this level, he acquires analytical knowledge consisting in: (a) the Dharma, (b)
meaning, (c) grammatical analysis and (d) a ready intellect, which are not obtained by
others. Hence here, it is discermed that the penetration of the dharmadhātu is the basis
of mastery over direct intuition. Therefore, the perfection of the powers is more
excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva] possesses the special power
of wisdom.
[13] By means of the tenth303 [he penetrates the reality] that it forms the
basis of mastery over karma; it is the fact that he penetrates [this reality of the
dharmadhātu] that is referred to.304 How is this understood? Hence he says: as the
consequence of his working for the welfare of sentient beings at will
through his creative transformations. Through this resolve 305 on the tenth
spiritual level [the bodhisattva] penetrates [the reality] that the dharmadhātu is the basis
of mastery over karma. On account of this he obtains supremacy in regard to the
actions of a tathāgata. For thus, like the sugata, through his Transformation Bodies he
acts at will doing what is to be done at the appropriate time306 for the sentient beings
abiding in the infinite world-spheres of the ten directions. Therefore, the perfection of
direct intuition is more excellent on this spiritual level because [the bodhisattva]
omitted from the Tib., is most likely a partial quotation of the following passage from the
Bhasya: prathamadvitiyavasitaśrayatvam dharmadhatav aştamyaiva bhūmya pratividhyatiti

possesses the distinctive ability to both enjoy the Dharma and bring sentient beings to

[14] In this way the ten spiritual levels of the bodhisattva are respectively determined
as the counteragents to undefiled nescience which is an obscuration to each single
spiritual level and is also an impediment to the complete purification, in every respect,
[which facilitates] the tenfold penetration of the dharmadhatu and which is relevant to
these spiritual levels of the bodhisattva as has [just] been described. The peculiar
nature of the ninth and tenth spiritual levels is revealed through their results but not
through a peculiar penetration of a different objective support307, because [the
bodhisattva] in these states reaches a condition which cannot be defined. The purpose
of the penetration of the meaning of all-pervading etc. is [for the attainment of] a state
of excellence of the ten perfections, respectively, on the ten spiritual levels. Therefore,
these obscurations to the spiritual levels that have been described are also said to be
obscurations to the state of excellence of the perfections. Alternatively, it is said in a
Sūtra that the purpose of penetrating308 the meaning [of the dharmadhātu] as all-
pervading etc. is [to attain] the result such as the attainment of meditative concentration
which is distinguished by [the attainment of] ever-increasing spiritual levels and which
culminates in direct intuition in regard to all aspects.
5. The Totality of Obscuration.
However, in total:
II.17 abcd
Obscuration that consists in moral
defilement and obscuration that con-
sists in the knowable have now been
elucidated these are all the obscu-
rations in this regard. Liberation is
considered as being due to their
extinction.
For the liberation from all obscuration is considered as being due to the
extinction of this twofold obscuration.

Y107.7 [1] All the obscurations, which are of various kinds, have been described in the above.
In order to demonstrate that they are [all] included within two obscurations, he says:
however, in total...
II.17 ab
Y108
140
Obscuration that consists in moral
defilement and obscuration that con-
sists in the knowable has now been
elucidated.
As to how this is understood that in total there are only two and that a third does not
exist, he says:
II.17 c
These are all the obscurations in this
regard.
The ellipsis is that [all] are included 309. It is understood that all curation is included
within the two obscurations; another, i.e. a third, does not exist. Consequently, all
obscuration is included herein, hence liberation from all obscuration is con-
sidered as being due to the extinction of this twofold obscuration,
consisting in both moral defilement and the knowable which comprise all obscuration.
What is meant is: one should relinquish all obscuration ³10.
[2] Although obscuration to the Buddha level has not been elucidated, is it also
included in these [two]? [It is included, however] its inclusion is not due to its direct
mention but rather is due to its intrinsic nature. Moreover, it has certainly been
mentioned because of the statements about the pervading obscuration; otherwise it
would be just a limited obscuration. Alternatively, in order to include³11 the obscu-
ration to the Buddha level, he says:
II.17 cd
These are all the obscurations in this
regard. Liberation is considered as
being due to their extinction³12.
Because there can be no liberation in the absence of the extinction of the obscuration to
the Buddha leve!. Hence it has been illustrated that the latter [i.e. obscuration to the
Buddha level] is also an obscuration, just like the remaining obscurations. However,
undefiled nescience which is a condition of extraordinary subtlety and the latent
impressions of moral defilement are described as obscurations to the Buddha level.
Therefore, it has been elucidated in this way because it cannot be examined differently
due to its extraordinary subtlety.

The Summary Meaning of Obscuration.
The summary meaning of the obscurations Extensive obscuration
refers to the pervading. Minute obscuration refers to the limited.
Obscuration to application refers to the excessive. Obscuration to
attainment refers to the equal. Obscuration to the special attainment
refers to acceptance and rejection.
Obscuration to correct application
refers to the ninefold obscuration consisting in moral defilement.
Obscuration to the [instrumental] causes refers to [the obscuration] to
virtue etc. and is due to the influence of the tenfold causal categories³13.
Obscuration to the entry into reality refers to [the obscuration] to the
factors that contribute to enlightenment. Obscuration to supreme virtue
refers to the obscuration] to the perfections. Obscuration to the state
of excellence of the latter refers to [the obscuration] to the spiritual
levels. The complete collection of obscurations refer to the two types
in total.
313
141
[Sthiramati]
Y108.8 Extensive obscuration refers to the pervading; i.e. obscuration that consists in
both moral defilement and the knowable which pertains to the spiritual lineages of the
bodhisattva. Minute obscuration refers to the limited; i.e. only obscuration
that consists in moral defilement and which is pertinent to the spiritual lineages of the
śrävaka etc. Obscuration to application refers to the excessive; this pertains
only to those who course in passion etc. and it is on account of this that application is
not attained. Obscuration to attainment refers to the equal314; this pertains to
those who course in equal shares for it acts as an impediment to attainment. Obscu-
ration to the special attainment refers to acceptance and rejection³15
pertains to those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva because it is the
obscuration to a special understanding. The special understanding consists in [the
attainment of the nirvāṇa [in which the bodhisattva is] not permanently fixed and this
should be understood as a special result. Obscuration to correct application
refers to the ninefold characteristics of moral defilement316; since it is

[qualities] such as virtue and is due to the influence of the causal categories", rgyu la sgrib pa ni

142
stated that the nine fetters are obscurations. The way in which these become obscu-
rations to correct application has [already] been described. Obscuration to the
[instrumental] causes refers to [the obscuration] to virtue etc. and is
due to the influence of the tenfold causal categories317; because it acts as an
obscuration by causing obstruction318 to the cause of virtue etc., it is described as an
obscuration to the [instrumental] causes. Obscuration to the entry to reality
refers to [the obscuration] to the factors that contribute to enlight-
enment 319; for [the bodhisattva] enters reality by means of these. Obscuration to
supreme virtue refers to [the obscuration] to the perfections320; because
there is no virtue superior to this. Obscuration to the special state of
excellence of the latter refers to [the obscuration] to the spiritual levels;
because only the perfections which form the basis of supramundane excellence are
described as the spiritual levels. The complete collection of obscurations
refer to the two types in total; i.e. obscuration that consists in moral defilement
and obscuration that consists in the knowable because all obscurations are included in
these two.
The statements of summary meaning are for the purpose of ease in comprehension
and retention since [a treatise] which has been summarized is comprehended and

neous inversion, (d) the reality that
consists cause and result and (e)
that of the gross and the subtle;
(f) Well-established reality, (g) the
reality of the sphere of purity, (h)
the reality of the aggregation, (i) that
which is characterized by differen-
tiation and (j) the tenfold reality of
the skills which [act] in opposition
to the false view of self.
144
There are ten kinds of reality, namely, (a) the basic reality, (b) the
reality of characteristic, (c) the reality free from erroneous inversion,
(d) the reality of cause and result, (e) the reality of the gross and the
subtle, (f) well-established reality, (g) the reality of the sphere of
purity, (h) the reality of the aggregation, (i) the reality of differentiation
and (j) the reality of the skills. Moreover, the latter [which act] as the
counteragents to the ten kinds of self-grasping should be understood as
being tenfold, namely, skill in the aggregates, skill in the elements, skill
in the sense-fields, skill in dependent origination, skill in the possible
and the impossible, skill in the sense faculties, skill in the times, skill
in the [four] truths, skill in the vehicles and skill in the conditioned and
the unconditioned.
[1] Immediately following the explanation of the obscurations is the appropriate place
for the explanation of reality since it was listed immediately after [the obscurations].
Hence [Vasubandhu] says: with reference to reality, [Maitreyal says... There
are various kinds of reality, consequently, without an understanding of their differen-Y111
145
tiation the essential nature of the realities is difficult to understand. Hence, in order to
clearly illustrate the differentiation of the realities at the beginning, he says:
III.1 a
There is: (a) basic reality, (b) the
reality of characteristic etc.
[2] [Some say] the statement about the basic reality is for the sake of showing
that the other realities are included there within the basic reality. The statement about
the reality of characteristic is for the sake of overcoming the faults that have
entered into clear comprehension, relinquishment and realization in regard to basic
reality. The statement about the reality free from erroneous inversion is for
the sake of demonstrating the expedients for withdrawal from samsāra. The statement
about the reality of cause and result is for the sake of showing the 'going forth'
by means of the śrävaka vehicle for one who has become weary [of samsāra] because
the śrävaka goes forth by virtue of his penetration of the four noble truths and (his
progress in] meditative development. The statement about the reality of the gross
is for the sake of showing the expedients for the accomplishment of knowledge of all
aspects. The statement about the reality of the subtle is for the sake of showing
the expedients for the relinquishment of all obscuration. The statement about well-
established reality is: (a) for the sake of showing the expedients which facilitate the
explanation of the extremely well-defined³ Dharma and (b) for the sake of showing the
expedients for the refutation of all counter-arguments. The statement about the real-
ity of the sphere of purity is for the sake of showing the differences in purity
according to its differentiation with regard to spiritual lineage, sense faculty and mental
disposition, although equal [i.e. non-differentiated] with regard to the dharmadhātu.
The statement about the reality of aggregation is for the sake of showing the
expedients for entry into defilement and purity in all aspects. The statement about the
reality of differentiation is for the purpose of showing the capacity for reversal of
all uncertainty, beginning with funcertainty in regard to] thusness. The statement about
the reality of the skills is for the sake of showing the expedients for the estab-
lishment of non-substantiality after having checked self-grasping, in all its modes.

to incorrect application only in respect to the former [i.e. the bodhisattvas]. The third
reality is conformable to correct application. The fourth reality is common to both
śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. The fifth reality is an expedient for accomplishment.
The sixth reality is common to people in general. The seventh reality is not common to
the latter. The eighth reality consists in the totality of the knowable. The ninth reality
refers to intrinsic nature. The tenth reality refers to the eradication of the root of
defilement.
[4] In brief, these ten realities are the basis of all the statements of the tathāgatas with
hidden meaning. In detail, reality is immeasurable. Some believe that because it is
conformable with reality the conventional too is described as a reality in this context.
Others believe that these are all realities because they are not disconsonant with the
modes as described, considering that, that which is not disconsonant with a particular
mode, is a reality as such.
In the above, the basic reality refers to:

The three natures;
[Namely], the imaginary, the other-dependent and the perfected,
because the other realities are respectively determined in relation to
these. Why is reality considered in relation to the three natures?

(a) That which is eternally
existent, (b) that which exists but not
as a reality and (c) that which both
exists and does not exist as a reality;
these are thus considered [as the
realities] in relation to the three
natures.
(a) Since that which is characterized as the imaginary is eternally
non-existent, it is a reality in relation to the imaginary nature because it
is not erroneously inverted. (b) Since that which is characterized as the
other-dependent exists, but not as a reality because it consists in error,

Since these have not been established, he says: the imaginary, the other-
dependent and the perfected. In order to demonstrate the reason why the three
natures are described as comprising the basic reality, he says: because the other
realities are respectively determined in relation to these. What is meant is:
the other realities, such as that of characteristic, are included within that [basic reality).
[2] Why should these three natures be studied? Some believe that it is in order to
demonstrate: (a) conventional usage, (b) the absolute and (c) the basis of the latter.
Others believe it is in order to demonstrate: (a) erroneous inversion, (b) the cause of
that and (c) the objective support that acts as the counteragent to these. Others believe
it is in order to demonstrate the foundation of: (a) relinquishment, (b) clear comprehen-
sion and (c) realization so as to facilitate separation from obscurations on the part of the
bodhisattva. Others believe that it is for the sake of the error-free understanding of the
nature of the perfection of wisdom, which is profound by nature, by way of the three
natures. For it is stated as follows in two verses from the Abhidharmasūtra 10:
Y112
147
it is a reality in relation to the other-dependent nature. (c) Since that
which is characterized as the perfected both exists and does not exist as
a reality, it is a reality in relation to the perfected nature.
Teachings about magical creations and the
like are in relation to the world¹1; teachings
about non-existence are in relation to the
imaginary; however, teachings about the
perfected pertain to the four kinds of purity
these are: intrinsic purity, immaculate
purity, the purity of the objective support
and the purity of the path, for, the pure
dharmas are incorporated in these four.
[The teachings from the Sutras about magical creations etc. are in relation to the
world¹2, i.e. the other-dependent nature, because, like a magical creation etc., it is a
false appearance. The teachings about non-existence are in relation to what does not
exist, i.e. the imaginary nature. The teachings about the perfected are in relation to the

fourfold purities. In regard to the fourfold purities: (a) intrinsic purity refers to
'thusness' etc. [intrinsic to] the stained state, (b) immaculate purity refers to the latter in
the stainless state (c) the purity of the path, which consists in the attainment [of the
understanding] of emptiness etc., refers to the factors that contribute to enlightenment
etc., (d) the purity of the objective support for the generation of the path refers to the
Dharma teachings, such as the Sutras, which flow out of the dharmadhatu because the
origination of the path is dependent upon these. Thus the abridged meaning of these
two verses is that all pure dharmas are included in these four purities.] Others
believe that the natures are admitted as threefold¹* in order to demonstrate that they are
the respective objects of mundane, supramundane and the direct intuition attained
subsequently to the latter ¹5,
13
14
[3] Why is reality considered in relation to the three natures? For 'reality'
has the sense of being 'not erroneously inverted', thus what is intended by this
question: "why reality considered in relation to the three natures?", is: why is that
which is not erroneously inverted considered in relation to the three natures?
III.3 ab
The three natures [refer to]: (a) that
which is eternally non-existent¹6 etc.
That which is characterized as the imaginary is eternally non-existent.
That [object] in regard to which naive people have notional attachment to the appre-
hended object and apprehending subject and also to the signified and signifier, like in a
dream, has¹7 an imaginary nature because its essential nature does not exist. Hence¹8,
since it has both the nature of a non-ens and is without error, that which is character-
ized by the imaginary does not exist. Consequently, only non-existence is described as
the reality in relation to the imaginary nature because it is not erroneously
inverted. Here he shows the meaning of reality as 'not erroneously inverted'.

[4] That which is characterized as the other-dependent exists but not as
a reality ¹9. That which is characterized by the imaginary, i.e. the apprehended object
and apprehending subject etc., does exist since it is the basis of conventional
[linguistic] usage. However, because it does not exist in its nature as apprehended
object and apprehending subject etc. it does not exist as a reality as such. In order to
clearly illustrate this, he says: because it consists in 'bare' error. This is what is
being said: that which appears 20, like the material cause of a magical creation, does
exist; the way in which it appears, like a magically created man etc., i.e. in the aspect of
apprehended object and apprehending subject, does not exist as such hence it is
[described as] error. It is a reality in relation to the other-dependent
nature21. That which exists in a different way is manifested in the aspect of some-
thing non-existent in relation to itself. That it is because it is not erroneously inverted
is understood here also because this is the subject under discussion.
[5] That which is characterized as the perfected both exists and does not
exist as a reality 22. That which is characterized by the perfected is a reality that
both exists and does not exist. It exists because it has the nature of the existence of the
non-existence of the duality; and it does not exist because it has the nature of the non-
existence of the duality. It is a reality because it is the objective support for purity. It
is a reality in relation to the perfected nature; it is the fact that this is because
it is not erroneously inverted that is referred to.

[1] Since the reality of the three natures has been described but its characteristic has
not, or else, since the reality of characteristic was [initially] mentioned immediately
following basic reality and it has not been established, he asks: what is the reality
of characteristic? Hence he says:
III.4 ab
Views that consist in imputation and
negation in regard to: (a) the
dharmas and the personal entity etc.
Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to the personal
entity and the dharmas do not arise due to the knowledge of this 24 the
reality-characteristic in relation to the imaginary nature. Views that con-
sist in imputation refer to the notional attachment to the self and to the dharmas of form
etc. as existing25 in an absolute sense and which, being separate26 from consciousness
in the appearance of these, form its objective supports. The view that consists in nega-
tion refers to the notion that they [i.e. self and dharmas etc.] do not exist even by way
of conventional [linguistic] usage. Others say that the view that consists in negation is
that which rejects consciousness as an appearance of the personal entity and the
dharmas; this should be thought of as the rejection of the apprehending subject27.
Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to the personal entity and the
dharmas do not arise due to the discrimination of a particular characteristic [this is]
the reality-characteristic in relation to the imaginary nature which should be understood
as being devoid of imputation and negation is that characteristic. And this is a reality
as conventional usage but not by way of own-being because the views that consists in

Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to the
personal entity and the dharmas do not arise due the knowledge of this
the reality-characteristic in relation to the imaginary nature. Views that
consist in imputation and negation in regard to the apprehended object
and apprehending subject do not arise due to the knowledge of this the
reality-characteristic in relation to the other-dependent nature. Views
that consist in imputation and negation in regard to existent and non-
existent [entities] do not arise due to the knowledge of this the reality-
characteristic in relation to the perfected nature. This non-erroneously
inverted (reality-) characteristic23 in relation to the basic reality is
described as the reality of characteristic.

imputation and negation in regard to the dharmas and the personal entity do not arise,
i.e. they are not produced, due to the awareness that they are imaginary.
[2] Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to the
apprehended object and apprehending subject...; the erroneous appearance of
apprehended object and apprehending subject is [respectively] grasped as dharma and
personal entity if one is notionally attached to their existence as a reality - the impu-
tation in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject occurs in this way.
Now if one is notionally attached to the non-existence of both the apprehending subject
and apprehended object alike, then the negation in regard to the apprehended object and
apprehending subject [occurs]28. Views that consist in imputation and nega-
tion in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject do
not arise due to the knowledge of this characteristic, the reality-character-
istic in relation to the other-dependent nature which should be known as
devoid of imputation and negation. Furthermore, the latter does not exist insofar as its
nature as apprehended object and apprehending subject imaginatively constructed 29,
but it does exist insofar as it forms the basis for the conventional usage in regard to it.
Due to clear comprehension thus, the views that consist in imputation and negation do
not arise in regard to the other-dependent.
[3] Views that consist in imputation and negation in regard to non-
existent [entities] ³0...; certain people say that if one perceives emptiness as some-
thing existent, then this is [equivalent to] the view that imputes existence. Conversely,
if [one perceives emptiness] as something non-existent, then this is [equivalent to] the
view that it is not an existent. Moreover, both of these views in regard existent and
non-existent [entities] do not arise due to the knowledge of this character-
istic³1 the reality-characteristic in relation to the perfected nature. Some
believe that³2 this [i.e. the reality-characteristic] is, in its own-being, free from both
existence and non-existence because views abour existence and non-existence in regard
to the perfected nature do not arise as the consequence of its knowledge. Others again
say that the notion the. the emptiness of essential nature is [equivalent to] the non-
existence of the duality33 is [to succumb to] the extreme of the imputation of exis-

tence34 because there is the imputation of an existent essential nature to that which in
its nature is free from both existence and non-existence. Conversely, the notion that
this [i.e. the non-existence of the duality] does not exist by way of an essential nature
consisting in the non-existence of the duality which is free from both existence and
non-existence and is the sphere of direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation³5
is [to succumb to] the extreme of the negation of non-existence. Others 36 believe that
both of these explanations should be reflected upon because of the intimate connection,
individually, of existence and non-existence with the views that consist in imputation
and negation. In this context, existence refers to the existence of the non-existence of
the duality. If one grasps the latter as a definite ens, then existence is imputed. If one
grasps it as a definite non-ens, then it is negated. Moreover, non-existence refers to the
non-existence of the duality. If one grasps this in terms of annihilation, then non-exis-
tence is imputed as an absolute non-existence. Now if one grasps it just by way of the
duality, then there is negation because it is manifested as a non-existent duality. Alter-
natively, if one grasps it as having an existent essential nature, then there is imputation.
Conversely, if one grasps it purely as a non-ens, then defilement and purification are
negated. This avoidance of the two extremes³7 is [equivalent to] the reality character-
istic in relation to the perfected nature. [Objection]: Is it not so that the characteristic of
the three natures has already been mentioned in the above? [I.e. Ch.1.5 cd]: "[The three
natures] ...are taught on account of the object, the imagination of what is unreal and the
non-existence of the duality [respectively]". [Response]: In the latter, the
'characteristic' refers to the own-being (svabhāva) but here it refers to the mark (cihna)
hence its mention here is not tautologous [as is evident in such statements as]: "...this
the reality-characteristic due to the knowledge of which the two [views] do not arise",
that is to say, the views that consist in imputation and negation in relation to the
personal entity etc. do not arise due to the knowledge of this 38 the characteristic of the
basic reality.

For the three natures consist in basic reality. In relation to these

object as non-existent, (b) the object as coming into being and passing
away and (c) the object as stained and stainless41.

An impermanent object is: (a) a non-

coming into being and passing away;
and (c) stained and stainless, respec-
tively, in relation to basic reality.
In relation to [the threefold] basic reality, respectively42. Suffering
is: (a) due to appropriating, i.e. due to the appropriating of notional
attachment to the personal entity and the dharmas, (b) due to the char-
acteristic, i.e. due to the characteristic of the threefold nature of
suffering and (c) due to association, i.e. due to the association with
suffering. Thus should [suffering] be understood43 in relation to that
[threefold] basic reality, respectively.

Suffering is stated as being due to:
(a) appropriating, (b) the character-

other and (c) intrinsic nature;

Since the imaginary characteristic does not exist in any mode what-
soever the very non-existence is its emptiness. Since the other-depen-
dent characteristic does not exist in the manner in which it is imagined
but is not non-existent in every respect, its existence as something other
is emptiness. Since the perfected characteristic has emptiness for its
own-being its very intrinsic nature is emptiness.

Since the very characteristic of the imaginary nature does not exist
the very absence of characteristic is its insubstantiality. Since the char-
acteristic of the other-dependent does exit, but not in the manner in
which it is imagined, the characteristic which is a characteristic differ-
ent from that [which is imagined] is its insubstantiality. However,
since the perfected nature consists in insubstantiality, the individual
characteristic44 itself is its insubstantiality.
The three kinds of impermanence have now been revealed in relation
to the threefold basic reality as the impermanence of: (a) a non-existing
object, (b) the impermanence of what comes into being and passes away
and (c) the impermanence of what is stained and stainless.
The nature of suffering is threefold: (a) suffering due to appropri-
ating, (b) suffering due to the characteristic and (c) suffering due to
association. Emptiness is threefold: (a) the emptiness of what is non-
existent, (b) the emptiness of what exists as something other and (c) the
emptiness of own-being. Insubstantiality is threefold: (a) insubstan-
tiality as the absence of characteristic, (b) insubstantiality as a different
characteristic and (c) insubstantiality as the individual characteristic.
[Sthiramati]
Insubstantiality is explained as: (a)
the absence of characteristic, (b) the
difference of characteristic from that
[which is imagined] and (c) the indi-
vidual characteristic.
Y116.15 [1] Immediately following the reality of characteristic45, the reality free from erro-
neous inversion should be stated because the latter was listed immediately after the
former; hence he says: the reality free from erroneous inversion. For the
permanent, the painful, the empty and the insubstantial46 are described as

the reality free from erroneous inversion because they [act as] counteragents 47
to the erroneous inversion of permanence, pleasure, purity and the substan-
tiality. Previously, the inclusion of the other realities within the basic reality was
asserted, hence he asks: how do the latter relate to basic reality? As the
impermanence [of what is impermanent] etc48. The impermanent etc. refers
to the modes of the impermanent, the painful, the empty and the insubstantial the state
(-tā of anitya-tā) of that is impermanence etc. In order to demonstrate that the reality
free from erroneous inversion is included within the basic reality, he says:
[2]
An impermanent object is: (a) a non-
existent object etc.
For there are three kinds of impermanent object: (a) the object as
existent, (b) the object as coming into being and passing away and (c)
the object as stained and stainless; that which exists eternally as such is perman-
ent; the inverse of this is impermanent; ...in relation to these [three], respec-
tively. With regard to these: (a) the imaginary nature is impermanent in the sense of
the impermanence of something eternally non-existent; others believe that this is to be
understood according to the rules of grammatical analysis, i.e. the impermanent (anitya)
is always non-existent (asannitya). (b) The other-dependent nature is impermanent in
the sense of impermanence characterized by coming into being and passing away every
moment, because it arises from causal conditions, and because there is no causality
when it passes away. (c) The perfected nature is impermanent in the sense of adven-
titious impermanence 49 which is characterized by both the possession of stain and
stainlessness, although it consists in a dharma50 that does not change.

Suffering is stated as being due to:
(a) appropriating, (b) the charac-
teristic etc.
Suffering51 is threefold: (a) the suffering due to appropriating, (b) the suffering due to
the characteristic and (c) the suffering due to association. Of these, the imaginary
nature consists in suffering that is (a) due to appropriating. There is suffering
since suffering is appropriated (upādīyate) either in the present life or in other lives on
account of the absence of clear comprehension. And in order to demonstrate the
manner in which suffering is appropriated on account of this absence of clear compre-

hension, he says: due to the appropriating of notional attachment to the
personal entity and the dharmas. There is the notional attachment to the
personal entity and the dharmas since one becomes notionally attached to the personal
entity and the dharmas through 'grasping' an entity on account of this [absence of clear
comprehension]. This [appropriating] belongs to the imaginary nature because it has
'fallen' into duality. It is described in this way because the continuation of suffering is
due to the notional attachment to the imaginary nature52. The imaginary itself is not
suffering because it does not exist53. Alternatively, since the imaginary nature is
appropriated in the nature of an entity on account of the notional attachment to the
personal entity and the dharmas, thus the imaginary nature consists in the suffering that
is due to grasping.
[4] The other-dependent nature is referred to as the suffering that is (b) due to the
characteristic. For the threefold nature of suffering refers to the suffering of
suffering, the suffering of change and the suffering of the formative forces. Moreover,
since these three sufferings are the sufferings that pertain to the other-dependent54,
they are [described as] the suffering that is due to the characteristic.
[5] The perfected nature consists in suffering that is: (c) due to association. The
word "and" has a conjunctive sense. How is it due to association? He says: due to
the association with suffering. The other-dependent nature consists in suffer-
ing; the real nature of the latter is described as suffering because even though perfected
it is also associated with suffering. [Thus should suffering be understood] in
relation to that [threefold] basic reality, respectively. In this regard, the
suffering that is on account of grasping consists in the imaginary. [The suffering] that
is on account of the characteristic consists in the other-dependent. [The suffering] that
is on account of association consists in the perfected.
[6]
52
Emptiness is threefold: (a) emptiness as non-existence, (b) emptiness as an existence as
something other and (c) emptiness as intrinsic nature. Therein, emptiness as non-exis-
tence pertains to the imaginary nature. In order to clearly illustrate just this55, he says:
since the imaginary characteristic, like the essential nature of horns on a hare
53
III.7 ab

55
Emptiness is considered as: (a) non-
existence, (b) existence as something
other and (c) intrinsic nature;
Tib. is slightly different: "...because notional attachment to the imaginary nature is the ground
for the continuity of suffering", kun brtags pa'i no bo ñid la mnon par žen pa ni sdug bsnal gyi
rgyun gyi rgyu yin pas (D246a.6).

etc., does not exist as the existing apprehended object in any mode whatsoever
through direct perception or inference; the very non-existence is its empti-
ness56. The emptiness of what exists as something other pertains to the other-depen-
dent [nature]. In order to clearly illustrate just this, he says: since the other-depen-
dent characteristic does not exist in the manner in which it is imagined
by naive people, i.e. in the nature of the duality, but is not non-existent in every
respect. Moreover, the mode in which it does exist is understood through mundane
direct intuition that is pure; therefore its existence as something other is empti-
ness 57. The emptiness as intrinsic nature pertains to the perfected [nature], hence he
says: since the perfected characteristic has emptiness for its own-being;
because it has the non-existence of the duality for its own-being; therefore, its very
intrinsic nature is emptiness, i.e. its very own-being.

III.7 c
Insubstantiality is threefold: (a) insubstantiality as the absence of characteristic, (b)
insubstantiality as a difference of characteristic59 and (c) insubstantiality as the individ-
ual characteristic. Of these, the absence of characteristic itself is an insubstantiality
because there is the absence of the characteristic of a nature that is imaginary. This is
why he says: since the very characteristic of the imaginary nature does not
exist, the very absence of characteristic is its insubstantiality 60, i.e. he
shows that it does not exist in any other mode. Insubstantiality as a difference in char-
acteristic pertains to the other-dependent, because, the characteristic of the other-
dependent does exist, in the nature of an entity, but not in the way in which
it is imagined by naive people, i.e. as the duality; the other-dependent character-
istic which is a characteristic different from that, i.e. dissimilar to the
imagined characteristic is its insubstantiality. Thus, its insubstantiality is shown
to be an imaginary substantiality61. Insubstantiality as the individual characteristic62 is
pertinent to the perfected since the perfected nature consists in insubstantial-
ity because it has the non-existence of the apprehended object and apprehending
62
157
Insubstantiality is explained as: (a)
the absence of characteristic58 etc.

subject as its nature; hence by saying: the individual characteristic itself is its
insubstantiality, he shows that the perfected dharma has insubstantiality for its
own-being63
[8] Just what difference is there between these two terms, i.e. emptiness and insub-
stantiality? Some believe that wherein something does not exist, the former is empty of
the latter; however, if something is not the substance (ātman), i.e. the own-being of
something else, on account of this, the latter is insubstantial (anãtman) - this is the
difference between the two. Others again believe that although there is no difference in
reality, there is a difference according to the way in which they are respectively deter-
mined, since that wherein something does not exist is insubstantial because of the
absence of own-being on its part, however, in the former case, its emptiness is on
account of the absence of the perfected nature within it.
[9] In order to demonstrate that they [act as] the counteragents to the extremes of
imputation and negation and also that they consist in adventitious stain the three
kinds of impermanence have now been respectively revealed64 in relation
to the threefold basic reality as: (a) the impermanence of a non-existing
object, (b) the impermanence of what comes into being and passes away
and (c) the impermanence of what is stained and stainless. The reality free
from erroneous inversion65 is described in this way, concluding with the statement:
insubstantiality is threefold.
4. The Reality of Cause and Result.
The reality consisting in cause and result is [equivalent to the
[noble] truth of suffering, its origination, its cessation and the path [to
the latter] in relation to that same basic reality. How does the threefold
basic reality consist in the [four] truths beginning with suffering?
Because the latter are characterized by impermanence etc.
III.8 b
Hence it is considered as the truth of
suffering;
The truth of origination [is considered] through the threefold cate-
gories of origination. The threefold categories of origination are:

(a) latent impression, (b) manifes-
tation and (c) non-separation.
Origination as latent impression refers to the latent impressions of
the notional attachment to the imaginary nature. Origination as mani-
festation refers to karma and moral defilement. Origination as non-sep-
aration refers to the non-separation of thusness from obscuration.
The truth of cessation [is considered] through the three kinds of
cessation. The three kinds of cessation are:
III.9 ab
III.8 cd
Considered as: (a) non-origination
by way of own-being, (b) non-origi-
nation by way of the duality and (c)
the two extinctions of stain;
Non-origination by way of own-being, non-origination by way of
the apprehended object and apprehending subject and the two extinc-
tions of stain are stated as cessation through critical consideration and
also as thusness. These are the three kinds of cessation, namely,
cessation by way of own-being, cessation by way of the duality and
cessation by way of intrinsic nature.
How is the truth of the path respectively determined in relation to
the threefold basic reality?
III.9 cd & 10 a
66
159
In relation to their: (a) clear compre-
hension, (b) renunciation and (c)
realization as attainment; this is
stated as the truth of the path.
I.e. in relation to: (a) the clear comprehension of the imaginary [nature],
(b) the clear comprehension and renunciation of the other-dependent
[nature] and (c) the clear comprehension of the perfected [nature] and
its realization as attainment. Thus it should be understood that the
establishment of the truth of the path in this regard is in relation to
clear comprehension, renunciation and realization.
[Sthiramati]
[1] Since the reality of cause and result should be discussed immediately after the
latter [i.e. the reality free from erroneous inversion], he says: the reality consisting
in cause and result ...in relation to that same basic reality 66. Therein,
concerning the side of defilement, the truth of suffering is [equivalent to] the reality of
Read: phalahetumayan tattvam tatraiva malatattve in place of milatattve phalahetutattvam;
cf. Bhäşya N40.5.Y121
160
the result; the truth of origination is [equivalent to the reality of the cause. Moreover,
concerning the side of purification, the truth of cessation is [equivalent to] the reality of
the result and the truth of the path is [equivalent to] the reality of the cause. In this way
the four truths, beginning with suffering, are [equivalent to] the reality of cause and
result. It has been said that [this reality] is [equivalent to the truth67 of
suffering, its origination, its cessation and the path [to the latter] in rela-
tion to that same basic reality68.
[2] And since it is not discerned how basic reality pertains to the own-being of the
truth of suffering etc. he asks: how does the threefold basic reality consist in
the [four] truths beginning with suffering? Hence he says: because the
latter are characterized69 by impermanence etc.
III.8 b
Hence 70 it is considered as the truth
of suffering;
In detail, it is said that the impermanent, the painful, the empty and the insubstantial are
the characteristics of the truth of suffering and, as a totality, these exist individually in
the imaginary etc. Hence, the imaginary etc. are intended, individually, as the truth of
suffering.
71
[3] The truth of origination [is considered] as the threefold basic reality,
respectively, through the threefold categories of origination. Since their
origination is not understood, he says: the threefold categories of origination
are:
67
68
III.8 cd
The three kinds of origination are: (a) origination as latent impression, (b) origination
as manifestation and (c) origination as non-separation. Of these, the origination as
latent impression should be understood as the imaginary nature; hence he says:
...refers to the latent impressions of the notional attachment to the
imaginary nature. Since, although the imaginary nature does not exist, the dharmas
that consist in the mundane respectively determine the latent impressions of both con-
ceptual differentiation and moral defilement72 on account of notional attachment to its
existence; however, the [dharmas that consist in the] supramundane and which are
without notional attachment, do not. Consequently, the imaginary nature is described
as origination as latent impression. Origination as manifestation should be
(a) latent impression, (b) manifes-
tation and (c) non-separation.

understood as the other-dependent [nature]73; manifestation refers to the acquisition of
a substantial nature. That which comes into being from something else is [described
as] "origination as manifestation", because it originates from this. Furthermore, as to
its essential nature, he says: ...refers to karma and moral defilement and these
two consist in the other-dependent nature because they have the nature of substantial
entities. Origination as non-separation refers to [the non-separation] of
thusness74; how so? Hence he says: [its] non-separation from obscuration.
This is what is being said: [thusness] receives the title "origination" since: (a) suffering
originates as long as thusness is not separate from obscuration, or (b) thusness which
is not separate from obscuration -
is the real nature of origination.
[4] The truth of cessation which consists in basic reality [is considered]
through the three kinds of cessation and since these are not discerned, he says:
the three kinds of cessation are:
III.9 ab
Considered as: (a) non-origination
by way of own-being, (b) non-origi-
nation by way of the duality and (c)
the two extinctions of stain;
Therein, non-origination by way of own-being refers to the imaginary [nature]
since it is an absolute non-origination because it is devoid of own-being, like the son of
a barren woman. Non-origination by way of the apprehended object and
apprehending subject refers to the other-dependent; moreover, since this is absol-
utely devoid of the essential nature 75 of an apprehended object and apprehending
subject, it is non-origination by way of a nature that consists in an erroneous duality.
And the two extinctions of stain refer to the perfected; the word "and" has the
conjunctive sense. But since these [extinctions] are not discerned, he says: ...are
stated as cessation through critical consideration and also as thusness76.
Stain is twofold: (a) obscuration such as passion and (b) the imaginary. Therein, when
the 'seed' has been extracted from its basis through direct intuition that is without impu-
rity, an extinction [is achieved] which consists in the absolute non-origination of the
stain of passion etc. this is cessation through critical consideration. By means of
direct intuition into the absence of the duality which belongs to the sphere of thusness,
an extinction [is achieved] which consists in the non-origination of the stain of the
imaginary; this is thusness. Both of these consist in the perfected nature. These three

kinds of cessation are to be discerned in relation to basic reality, beginning with the
imaginary, according to their respective enumeration. However others believe that the
extinction77 of these dual stains consisting in moral defilement and the imaginary are
described as thusness on account of the penetration of thusness because of the state-
ment: cessation by way of the duality and cessation by way of intrinsic
nature. Intrinsic nature refers to thusness because this refers to the intrinsic luminos-
ity of mind. Hence, since it has thusness for its objective support, this cessation is
described as cessation by way of intrinsic nature, [whereas] cessation alone78 is
[described as] cessation through critical consideration. Others believe that cessation is
[equivalent to] thusness inasmuch as [suffering] has ceased in the latter79. Further-
more, since cessation consists in non-origination, after collecting together all [elements]
that have non-origination etc. for their own-being, they are described as the truth of
cessation. The inclusion of the truth of cessation within basic reality has now been
described.
[5] However, since the truth of the path should be included immediately after the latter,
he asks: how is the truth of the path respectively determined in relation to
the threefold basic reality ?80 Hence the statement beginning with:
III.9 c
In relation to their: (a) clear compre-
hension [(b) renunciation]81 etc.
i.e. in relation to: (a) the clear comprehension of the imaginary [nature];
since the imaginary nature is absolutely non-existent there is only its clear comprehen-
sion and not its renunciation, for the renunciation of what does not exist is not tenable.
(b) In relation to the clear comprehension and renunciation of the other-
dependent [nature], for the other-dependent is to be understood as not existing in
the manner in which it appears but not as non-existent in its whole nature, like the
imaginary; also, because karma and moral defilement have the nature of entities82, it
[i.e. the other-dependent] is to be renounced. And (c) in relation to the clear
comprehension of the perfected [nature] and its realization as attain-
ment. For the perfected should be clearly comprehended as being characterized by
both the exemption from existence and non-existence and as the turning about of the

basis 83. Since the turning about of the basis is to be realized as the liberated Dharma
Body, emptiness should be clearly comprehended. Cessation should be realized
through the realization as attainment. Others believe that there are two aspects to both
[clear comprehension and realization] because clear comprehension is twofold: (a) clear
comprehension as knowledge and (b) clear comprehension as renunciation84. Therein,
the first and the third [natures] are to be clearly comprehended through clear compre-
hension as knowledge but the second [nature] should be clearly comprehended as both.
Realization also is twofold: (a) realization as knowledge and (b) realization as attain-
ment. Therein, although all three [natures] are to be realized through realization as
knowledge only the third is [to be realized] through realization as attainment. Thus it
should be understood that the establishment of the truth of the path in
this, i.e. within basic reality, is in relation to clear comprehension, renunci-
ation and realization85; but not because it is included therein [i.e. within basic real-
ity]. In this [section] the following are revealed through the four truths: (a) defilement,
(b) that from which it originates, (c) the purification of these two and (d) that from
which this originates. However, their sequential order is in accordance with one's
intuitive understanding.
The reality of the gross and the subtle refers to the conventional and
absolute truth. How should this be understood in relation to basic
reality?
III.10 be
5. Gross and Subtle Reality.
83
For the conventional is threefold: (a) conventional as designation,
(b) conventional as knowledge and (c) conventional as utterance.
Through these [three], the conventional truth should be known in rela-
tion to the threefold] basic reality, respectively.
III.10 d
84

The gross [should be understood] by
way of: (a) designation, (b) knowl-
edge and (c) utterance;
However, the absolute [should be
understood] by way of the one.

164
The absolute truth is to be understood as being due to the one, i.e.
due only to the perfected nature. But how can that be absolute?
III.11 ab
Because the absolute is considered as
threefold, i.e. by way of: (a) object,
(b) attainment and (c) spiritual prac-
tice;
(a) The absolute as object is thusness, considering that it is the
object of the highest direct intuition. (b) The absolute as attainment is
nirvana, considering that it is the highest object. (c) The absolute as
spiritual practice is the path, considering that the highest is its object.
How can both the unconditioned and the conditioned be described as
the perfected nature?
III.11 cd
The two [are considered] by way of
perfection that is unchanging and
free from erroneous inversion.
The unconditioned is perfected insofar as it is [equivalent to]
unchanging perfection. The conditioned, which is incorporated in the
truth86 of the path, [is perfected] insofar as it is [equivalent to]
perfection free from erroneous inversions because of the absence of
erroneous inversion in regard to the entity that is the object of
knowledge.

[Sthiramati]
Y123.9 [1] The reality of the gross and the subtle87; gross reality refers to conven-
tional truth; subtle reality refers to absolute truth. Since, at the beginning, [the
bodhisattva] brings beings to maturity by means of the gross but liberates those who
have reached maturity by means of the subtle, the gross is [explained] prior to the
subtle which follows. This statement is contradictory to the congruity of a verse [i.e.
III.1d]. Therein conventional truth refers to gross reality because it is the domain of
non-concentrated knowledge; absolute truth refers to subtle reality because it is the
domain of concentrated knowledge. Alternatively, [the former] refers to the gross
because it is the domain of consciousness and [the latter] refers to the subtle because it
is the domain of direct intuition. Since it has been asserted that all the realities are
intended as being included within basic reality, he asks: how should this be
understood in relation to basic reality? Hence he says:
satya is omitted from the Tib. (cf.D12b.2).

[2]
In relation to the sic reality, the gross reality is to be understood by way of designa-
tion, knowledge and utterance 89. In order to clearly illustrate just this, he says: for the
conventional is threefold. Respectively determining the form of a non-existing
object, i.e. calling it a water-pitcher or a cloth90 is (a) the conventional as desig-
nation. Others believe that the conventional as designation refers to the articulation
by way of the name as distinct from the essential nature of form, sensation and con-
ceptualization etc. Others believe that the conventional as designation is that which is
conventionally expressed as form or sensation, depending upon verbal articulation. It
is the imaginary nature because, like mind and the mental concomitants91, it is non-
existent.
[3] (b) The conventional as knowledge. The conventional as knowledge refers
to that92 conceptual differentiation on account of which one becomes notionally
attached to forms etc. and water pitchers etc.93 in accordance with their respective
determination as having the nature of entities as if they were external realities, although
they are not external to the appearances in consciousness.
88
[4] And (c) the conventional as utterance. The word "and" has a conjunctive
sense. The conventional as utterance refers to the demonstration of the perfected
[nature] through its synonyms such as emptiness, thusness, the possession of stain and
stainlessness etc. 94, although it transcends conceptual differentiation and verbal
description.
89
III.10 bc
[5] The conventional truth should be known in relation to the [threefold]
basic reality, respectively, through these three aspects of the conventional.
The "conventional" refers to the conventional [linguistic] usage. "Designation" refers
to verbal expression. The conventional as designation refers to the conventional

[linguistic] usage through verbal expression alone in the absence of an object; there-
fore, the conventional truth is imaginary since it consists in the conventional as desig-
nation because the object does not exist. "Knowledge" refers to the notional attach-
ment to an object although it does not exist. The conventional usage that results from
that [knowledge] is the conventional as knowledge; furthermore, this refers to the
conceptual differentiation that pertains to notional attachment. Therefore, the conven-
tional truth consists in the other-dependent as it consists in the conventional by way of
knowledge. "Utterance" is that which [provides] a clear indication of the dharmadhātu
- which is inexpressible through words such as 'thusness'. The conventional usage in
regard to the dharmadhātu by means of that [utterance] is the conventional as utterance.
Hence, conventional truth consists in the perfected [nature] since it consists in the
conventional as utterance. Of these, the conventional as designation and utterance
should be understood as respective determinations [that occur] as comprised by the
circumstances but not in terms of own-being. Conventional truth has now been
described.
[6] Now the absolute truth should be mentioned, hence he says:
III.10 d
However, the absolute [should be
understood] by way of the one.
For it is impossible that the absolute can belong to the imaginary and other-dependent
[natures]; however, absolute truth is to be understood as being due to the
one, i.e. due to just the perfected nature 95. But, for what reason is that per-
fected [nature] described 96 as absolute? Hence he says:
[7]

the highest object (paramārtha) considering that⁹9 it is the object (artha) or [sense]
object (vișaya) of that [direct intuition], just like an object of the sense faculties. In
order to demonstrate this, he says: considering that it is the object of the
highest direct intuition. What is meant is: because it is determined as being an

objective support. [However], since it is not something that is separate from direct
intuition, at the time [of being intuited] it does not become an objective support, like the
appearances as representation-only; for example, apart from their mere representation
as form etc., the appearances as form etc. do not exist for those [objects] for which rep-
resentation-only is allowed 100,
[8] (b) The absolute as attainment is nirvāpa; thusness which is absolutely
devoid of stain is the characteristic of the turning about of the basis. How can this be
the absolute? Hence he says: considering that it is the highest objecti01, i.e.
considering that it is both an object (artha) and is the highest (parama), it is the highest
object (paramārtha). It is the highest in this regard because it is foremost among the
unconditioned and conditioned dharmas; it is an object in the sense that it is the aim of
the path. For thus, the attainment of nirvana is the aim of the path but nirvāṇa is the
object [i.e. the aim] because it is free from all harmful faults since that which is accom-
panied by fault is described as a non-object.
[9] (c) The absolute as spiritual practice is the path; why is this? Consid-
ering that the highest is its object; object (artha) here means [sense]-object
(vişaya) or aim (prayojana)102; the object is thusness, the aim is nirvāṇa. [Objection]:
If it is described as the highest 103 on account of the object, would there not be a recip-
rocal dependence [i.e. the path is highest on account of the object and the object is
highest on account of the path]? [Response]: If there is reciprocal dependence 104, what
fault is there? [Objection]: there can be no positive determination. [Response]: This
will not be so because there is reciprocal dependence as in the case of a lion and a
forest 105
[10] How can both the unconditioned, namely nirvana, and the condi-
tioned, namely the path, be described as the perfected nature?106 For absol-
ute truth has been explained as the perfected nature, however, it is not tenable that the
path be perfected considering that it has no non-existent previous and subsequent
portions. Therefore, the path is not [equivalent to] absolute truth and if it is not per-
fected it cannot be included within absolute truth. Hence he says:

The two [are considered] by way of
perfection that is both unchanging
and free from erroneous inversion 107.
An alternate [objection]: how can the unconditioned, namely nirvana, and the condi-
tioned, namely the path, be described as the perfected nature? For the perfected refers
to thusness and since it is devoid of the characteristic of the duality that pertains to the
other-dependent, the condition of perfection on the part of both nirvāṇa and the path is
not tenable. [Response]: this objection is not tenable108 since the non-existence of the
duality therein refers to the perfected, however, it is only the non-existence of the dual-
ity that is [referred to as] the perfected, thus what is other than this is not refuted. And
hence the two perfected [natures) other than this which comprise the absence of change
and the absence of erroneous inversion are also referred to as perfected. The uncondi-
tioned refers to nirvāṇa and thusness. The unconditioned is perfected insofar
as it is [equivalent to] unchanging perfection because it cannot be otherwise.
The conditioned, which is incorporated in the truth of the path and not
elsewhere, is perfected insofar as it is [equivalent to] perfection free from
erroneous inversion. As to why this is so, he says: because of the absence
of erroneous inversion in regard to the entity that is the object of
knowledge; i.e. since erroneous inversion never occurs in regard to the object of
knowledge. Therefore, the path is also perfected and consequently, due to the differ-
ences in intended meaning, [the assertion] that the perfected [nature] pertains to both
the conditioned and the unconditioned is not contradictory.
6. The Well Established Reality.
168
How is the well established reality respectively determined in rela-
tion to basic reality? Well established reality is twofold: (a) that which
is generally established and (b) that which is established through
reasoning. In this respect:
III.12 a
That which is generally established
results from the one;
It results from the imaginary nature. There is a similarity in the per-
spective of all worldlings insofar as their intellects enter into familiarity

It results just from the imaginary [nature]113 because of the impossibility [of its
establishment] in accordance with verbal description since it does not result from
something other. However, its essential nature is not known, hence he says: in
regard to entities etc.; the conventional symbol refers to knowledge which
connects the name and the possessor of the name. Familiarity...; this refers to the
endeavour and perspective that is repeatedly oriented towards that [conventional
symbol]114. Insofar as their intellects enter into the latter two115; just what
does this entry into familiarity with conventional symbols by the intellect refer to? It
refers to memory. This is what is being said: there is a similarity in the per-
spective of all worldlings, i.e. those who know the treatises and those who do
not, in regard to things that are conventionally expressed, insofar as their intellect is in
conformity with their memory which has familiarity with the conventional symbol.
Thus [they share beliefs] such as: "this is definitely earth...116" This

[2]
That which is established through
reasoning results from the three;
Since reasoning¹18 is carried out in regard to the threefold natures, the reality that is
well established through reasoning is respectively determined through the three
natures. In order to demonstrate this since it is not known, he says: that ...by those
who are wise, i.e. learned in argumentation... Therein, those who are wise
refers to those who are learned in argumentation¹19⁹. The dialecticians refers to the
examiners; after thinking about the explanation of the former [i.e. those who are
learned in argumentation], the latter term [i.e. dialecticians] is stated ¹20. Alternatively,
those who are wise are the seekers for what is wholesome. Those who are learned in
argumentation are those whose skill is complete in regard to the non-contradictory
meaning of the four types of reasoning which consist in: (a) consideration, (b) cause
and effect, (c) [proof of] logical possibility and (d) real nature¹21. The dialecticians are
those who have the capacity for conjecture and exclusion and are the authors of the
treatises that are free from erroneous inversion for they are based upon the scriptural
statements of the tathāgatas. The examiners are learned in their own and other's
treatises and are scrutineers of virtues and faults. However, some people do not read
"examiners", consequently, they query just who these "wise ones" are when it is said:
on the part of those who are wise'. Hence¹22, [Vasubandhu] says: "those who are
learned in argumentation". Moreover, the latter are of two types because they can be
situated on the level of dialectic or on the level of meditative development; therefore,
the dialecticians are specified. Since certain of these people are investigators of what is
generally established 123, he says: based upon the three means of valid knowl-
edge. What is meant is: since there is no contradiction with the three means of valid
knowledge ¹24. The three means of valid knowledge are: (a) direct perception, (b)
inference and (c) scriptural tradition. Direct perception in this context refers to: (a) the

experiencing of pleasure and pain and the like which arises from the five sense facul-
ties and (b) mental [perception]125, Inference refers to the knowledge of the meaning
that is to be inferred through the three types of [inferential] mark, 126 Scriptural tradi-
tion refers to the words of trustworthy people; moreover, trustworthy people are those
who are free from the causes of falsehood. Alternatively, he says: "based upon the
three means of valid knowledge" because the probandum that has been established can
be proved for others by means of the reason and example established through direct
perception, inference and scriptural tradition. An entity is established 127 through
reasoning which consists in the proof of logical possibility; logical possi-
bility refers to the three types of [inferential] mark because they are the means of
substantiating the probandum. The term: "proof of logical possibility"
(upapattisādhana) is a tatpurușa compound. The three types of [inferential] mark are
mentioned because the substantiation of that [proof] is on account of these. Reasoning
is the means, through the specific formulation of which, all that pertains to the three
types of [inferential] mark is stated. Alternatively, the logical possibility is that which
is not possible otherwise. The reasoning that consists in its proof refers to the [train of
thought] that connects the component parts of a syllogism - thus is the resolution of the
term: "reasoning that consists in the proof of logical possibility"
(upapattisādhanayukti), Alternatively, it may be resolved as: 'the reasoning that
consists in the proof is logically possible' [i.e. as a karmadhārya compound]. The
term: "logical possibility" is employed in order to distinguish this from the other
reasonings of proofl28. In this way, based upon the three means of valid knowledge,
an entity consisting in either of the three natures which is established through the
reasoning of the proof of logical possibility is described as well established through
reasoning ¹29. The well established reality has now been described.

7. The Reality of the Sphere of Purity.
172
There is the reality of the twofold sphere of purity: (a) the sphere of
direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in moral
defilement and (b) the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of
obscuration that consists in the knowable. This [reality] is:
III.12 cd
A twofold sphere of purity; it is pro-
claimed as being due just to the one.
It is due just to the perfected nature for the other natures do not
belong to the sphere of the two pure direct intuitions.
[Sthiramati]
Y129.10 [1] Since the domain of purity should be mentioned immediately following the latter
[i.e. the well established reality], he says: there is the twofold reality of the
sphere of purity. Now, in order to demonstrate this twofold mode, he says: (a)
the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that
consists in moral defilement and (b) the sphere of direct intuition for
the purification of obscuration that consists in the knowable. The purifi-
cation of obscuration that consists in moral defilement is [equivalent to] the relinquish-
ment of obscuration that consists in moral defilement ¹30.
The term:
kleśăvaraṇaviśuddhijñāna may be interpreted either as [a dative or locative tatpuruşa
compound, i.e.:] the direct intuition: (a) leading to the purification of obscuration con-
sisting in moral defilement, or (b) in regard to the purification of obscuration consisting
in moral defilement. What is meant is [the direct intuition]: (a) that has the purification
of obscuration consisting in moral defilement for its aim, or (b) that causes that
[purification]. The words: "the sphere of that direct intuition for the purification of
obscuration consisting in moral defilement" refer to [direct intuition which has the
purification of that] for its object.131 The sphere of direct intuition for the purification
of obscuration that consists in the knowable should also be described in this way.
[2] Of these, obscuration that consists in moral defilement refers to all moral defile-
ments and secondary defilements that are to be relinquished by the paths ¹32 of vision
and meditative development. Hence the domain of the direct intuition in regard to
vision, meditative development and what relates to these two which is the reality of the
śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas133 is described as the truth of suffering, its origination,
130 Ms.(40a) line 2 begins: -varaṇaprahāṇam although Y's reading (p.129.13) would indicate that
these two words are fully reconstructed.

173
its cessation and the path (to the latter]. This is the sphere of the direct intuition for the
purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement. The knowable refers to
that which is to be known and this, collectively, comprises the five branches of learn-
ing. These are stated as the learning in regard to: (a) subjectivity, (b) grammatical anal-
ysis, (c) logic, (d) medicine and (e) all arts and crafts. The obscuration that consists in
the knowable refers to undefiled nescience which is an impediment to direct intuition in
regard to these. The purification of that is [the knowledge] comprised in the spiritual
level that is [equivalent to] the course of firm conviction which conforms with supra-
mundane direct intuition and [the knowledge] comprised in the eleven spiritual levels
beginning with the 'Joyous'. Moreover, [this purification] refers to the knowledge that
is attained subsequently to that [knowledge in the eleven levels]. This is present within
the mental continuum of the bodhisattvas and tathāgatas, and, since its objective
support is thusness because this has the sense of being all-pervading etc., the reality of
the sphere of direct intuition for the purification of obscuration that consists in the
knowable is [equivalent to] thusness. [Objection]: Since the twofold sphere of purity
has already been explained by way of the description of both the reality of the cause
and result and the reality of the subtle, is it not so that their enumeration again here is
unnecessary? [Response]: It is not unnecessary because the reality of the cause and
result and of the subtle were formerly mentioned in order to define them as entities.
However, in this context, it concems the mode in which obscuration is purified, hence,
this [reality] is explained.
[3] This twofold sphere of purity is proclaimed as being due to just the one, i.e. it is
due just to the perfected nature. Here now he provides the reason for the
other natures do not belong to the sphere of the [two]134 pure direct
intuitions 135. What is the reason? Because unreal imagination [which is equivalent
to the other-dependent nature] is stained on account of its possession of the two stains
that comprise disquiet, and the imaginary [nature] does not exist. However, since real
nature is the domain of the twofold direct intuition, the reality of the domain of
purity 136 is determined as being just due to the perfected [nature]. The reality of the
sphere of purity has now been described.

reality be understood in relation to the threefold137 basic reality? In order
to demonstrate that the inclusion reality is included within the threefold basic reality, he
says:
III.13 ab
There is the inclusion of: (a) the
causal-sign, (b) conceptual differen-
tiation and (c) the name, within the
two;
These are included within the two: (a) the other-dependent and (b) the imaginary
[natures]. Therein, the inclusion reality comprises five categories, hence he says: from
the point of view of the five categories, according to which is appropri-
ate...
138 Five categories should be understood as being included within basic reality,
according to which is appropriate, but not according to sequential order. Now, the five
categories are: (a) the causal-sign, (b) the name, (c) conceptual differentiation, (d) thus-
137 Ms.(40b.1): trividhe; disregard Y's fn.1 p.131.
138
In the Ms.(40b.2) this passage reads as follows: tatra samgrahatattvam pañcavastūnity ata aha
yathayogam pañcavastiny ärabhyeti, however the Tib. has simply: de la bsdu ba'i de kho na ci
rigs su sbyar ro źes bya ba ni (D253a.3).Y132
175
ness and (e) correct direct intuition. These five categories are described as the inclu-
sion reality because all that is knowable is included within these five categories. In this
respect, some believe that the causal-sign refers to the store-consciousness, defiled
mind and the actual consciousnesses. It is [described as the "causal-sign" because it
exists as a reciprocal cause. The "name" is an expression or indication of just that
causal-sign although it is inexpressible, like [a gesture such as] the winking of the eye.
"Conceptual differentiation" refers to mind and the mental concomitants associated
with all the three realms [of existence] which consist in conceptual differentiation, as
both own-being and particular, of the causal-sign as has just been described.
"Thusness" refers to emptiness. "Correct direct intuition" consists in the supra-
mundane and has thusness for its objective support. Now, as to their sequential order:
the causal-sign comes first therein because it is the foundation for the designation as
the defilement; then comes the name because it is designated as the defilement; then
comes conceptual differentiation because as soon as it has a name, then conceptual
differentiation [occurs] in regard to that entity designated as a defilement; then comes
thusness and correct direct intuition because that defilement is checked on account of
thusness and correct direct intuition. Others believe that the meaning of these five
categories [is evident] in this verse:
Error is the cause of error, the cause of that
is disquiet. Therefore, the cause of the
latter is error¹39. But knowledge in this
regard 140 is intrinsically tranquil.
Therein, the cause of error¹41, which is incorporated in the internal consciousnesses of
sight etc., is external and internal error which are incorporated in form and the like and
sight and the like. Furthermore, the cause of this external and internal error¹42 is
disquiet and this is a latent impression of the store-consciousness. The cause of this
latent impression143 is none other than the external and internal error. As a conse-
quence, verbal expression in regard to it manifests and it is due to verbal expression
that the latent impression is lodged in the store-consciousness. The term "intrinsically
tranquil" refers to thusness because the dharmadhātu is intrinsically undefiled ¹44. The

words "...but knowledge in this regard", refer to that direct intuition included in the
path which has thusness for its objective support.
[2] Of these, there is the inclusion of the causal-sign and conceptual
differentiation by way of the other-dependent [nature]145, because they are
produced through causes and conditions, and [the inclusion] of the name by
way of the imaginary [nature]. The name is included by way of the imaginary
[nature] because no object exists in keeping with its name; thus, by connection, there is
inclusion of name by way of the imaginary [nature] but its inclusion is not by way of
own-being. And if it is said that the imaginary nature in not included in the five cate-
gories beginning with the causal-sign because it is established as being devoid of own-
being, such a statement is not contradicted because in that context there is the desire to
state inclusion in terms of own-being.146
[3]
[There is the inclusion] of correct
direct intuition and true reality etc.
Reality that is eternal or pure is true reality 147, i.e. thusness. Correct direct intuition
refers to: (a) the direct intuition that has emptiness for its objective support and is free
from the duality and (b) the purified mundane [knowledge] that is attained subse-
quently to the latter. I.e. there is the inclusion of thusness and correct
direct intuition by way of just the one, i.e. the perfected nature because it is
perfected on account of its perfection that is respectively without change and is free
from erroneous inversion. The inclusion reality has now been described.

146 This passage evidently aims to reconcile the differing views held by the various Yogacara
schools concerning the relationship of the five vastu with the three svabhāva. For example, the
Yogācārabhūmi-viniscayasamgrahani (D22b.2) asserts that none of the five vastu are included
in the parikalpita svabhāva, i.e. the first four are included in the paratantra and only tathata is
parinişpanna. Cf. J.D.Willis: A Study of the Chapter on Reality... (pp.75-83) for a discussion
on this matter. The Lankavatāra Sūtra (Nanjio p.227.11) on the other hand apportions both
nāma and nimitta to the parikalpita, vikalpa to the paratantra and samyagjñāna and tathata to the
parinişpanna. Cf. also Siddhi (p.537 ff.) where the five vastu and three svabhāva are discussed
in the context of the nimittabhäga / darśanabhaga dichotomy.
Tib. omits satattvam; cf. D253b.7.177
tual practice, (f) the reality of purification and (g) the reality of correct
spiritual practice. 148 And these seven have been explained in the
Sandhinirmocana Sutra as [the sevenfold] thusness149. Of these:
III.14 a
The reality of continuance is
twofold;
Basic reality should be understood as being characterized by the
imaginary and other-dependent [natures]. Inasmuch as it is the reality
of continuance, similarly it is:
III.14 b
Arrangement and wrong course;
The realities of arrangement and wrong spiritual practice should be
understood 150 similarly as comprising two [of the three] kinds of basic
reality.
III.14 cd
The one consists in: (a) the charac-
teristic, (b) the representation, (c)
purification and (d) correct spiritual
practice.
The four realities beginning with that of the characteristic consist in
the one basic reality which is characterized by the perfected.
[Sthiramati]
Y133.8 [1] Now151, the variety [of the realities] that are found in relation to the reality of
differentiation and the way they are incorporated within basic reality is not known,
hence he asks: how should the reality of differentiation be understood in
relation to basic reality? Hence he replies: the reality of differentiation is
sevenfold. As to which these are, he says: (a) the reality of continuance, (b)
the reality of characteristic etc. The seven types of thusness described in the
Sandhinirmocana Sutra, beginning with the thusness of continuance and concluding
with the thusness of correct spiritual practice are [equivalent to] these described here as
the sevenfold reality of differentiation, beginning with the reality of continuance and
concluding with the reality of correct spiritual practice. Therein, the reality of contin-
uance refers to the beginningless and endless nature of samsāra; and this is also
148 The Sanskrit text of the Bhäşya includes a passage of text here which is partly incoherent and
does not appear relevant to the context. It is not found in the Tibetan or Chinese versions, nor
is it acknowledged in the Tika, hence it has been omitted from the translation. It reads as
follows: tatra pravṛttitattvaditrividham/ anavaragreşv eti samsāraḥ tathatacittasamkleśät sattvāḥ

[equivalent to] the thusness of continuance because by no means does [samsăra] have
a beginning. The reality of characteristic is [equivalent to] the insubstantiality of the
personal entity and the dharmas; and since it is not something other this is also
equivalent to the thusness of characteristic 152, (c) The reality of representation
is [equivalent to the state of mere-representation of the dharmas. Others believe that
the reality of representation refers to the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differen-
tiation because this is the basis of representation 153. And since the reality of repre-
sentation is not something other, it is also described as the thusness of representation.
(d) The reality of arrangement is [equivalent to] the truth of suffering because
the formative forces are arranged [i.e. established] in suffering; and this is lequivalent
to] thusness considering that it is eternally just thus. (e) The reality of wrong
spiritual practice is [equivalent to] the truth of origination and this refers to the
continuance that is on account of the perception of virtue in regard to those formative
forces. (f) The reality of purification is [equivalent to] the purification of obscu-
ration that consists in moral defilement154 and this refers to thusness and the truth of
cessation. Others believe that the nature of the turning about of the basis, i.e. the nature
of cessation155, is [equivalent to] the truth of cessation. (g) The reality of correct
spiritual practice is [equivalent to] the truth of the path. Others believe that the
reality of representation156 is a fundamental application and that the reality of correct
spiritual practice and the reality of representation are [equivalent to] just the truth of the
path. Moreover, since these three realities are eternally just thus, they are described as
thusness.
[2] Of these:
III.14 a
The reality of continuance is
twofold;
Basic reality 157 should be understood as being characterized by the
imaginary and the other-dependent [natures]. Continuance therein refers to
the continuity of creatures who have no beginning, and since this [continuity] does not
exist, it consists in the imaginary nature. However, these [creatures] consist in the
other-dependent nature because their continuity is constituted by causes. In this way,
both the continuance and those for whom there is continuance are explained as the
152 Read: ananyathärvat ca tad eva lakṣaṇatathata in place of ananyathatvac caturvidhalaksanatathata
which is not substantiated by the Ms.(41a.7) nor by the Tib. which reads: gźan du mi 'gyur pa'i
phyir de ñid mtshan ñid kyi de bzin ñid (D254a.4).
153
154
155
156

The Tib. is slightly different: "...the reality of representation refers to direct intuition devoid of
conceptual differentiation or the basis of representation"; mam par mi rtug pa'i ye ses sam /
mam par rig pa'i gnas 'di ni mam par rig pa'i de kho na (D254a.5).
Ms.(41b.1): klesajñeyāva(raṇa) but jñeya is not found in the Tib. (cf. D254a.7).
nirodhatmată is not found in D (cf. D254a.7).
vijñaptitattvam is not found in the Ms.(41b.2) and has been inserted on the basis of the Tib.
(cf. D254b.1).
Read: mülatattvam in place of milatattve; cf. Bhaşya N43.13.&
Y135
reality of continuance. Alternatively, the beginningless production of moral defilement,
karma and rebirth is described as the continuance of samsara and this is characterized
by notional attachment to the imaginary nature, hence, the reality of the twofold contin-
uance is described as basic reality.
[3] Similarly it is:
III.14 b
Arrangement and wrong course158;
Wrong course is [equivalent to] wrong spiritual practice; these [should be under-
stood] similarly as comprising two [of the threel kinds of basic reality.
Since suffering and its origination are constituted by causes and conditions and
because they have the imaginary [nature] for their object, the realities of arrangement
and wrong spiritual practice are incorporated in these two [of the threefold basic
realities].
[4]
III.14 cd
179
The one consists in: (a) the char-
acteristic, (b) the representation, (c)
purification and (d) correct spiritual
practice 159.
[The one consists in the reality of characteristic, the reality of representation, the reality
of purification and the reality of correct spiritual practice. These four realities consist in
just the one basic reality, namely, the perfected nature. Therein, the reality of charac-
teristic and the reality of purification are perfected insofar as they consist in the perfec-
tion ¹60 that cannot be otherwise. The reality of representation and the reality of correct
spiritual practice are perfected insofar as they consist in the perfection that is free from
erroneous inversion.
[4] Herein, the sameness of sentient beings is shown through the three realities of
continuance, arrangement and wrong spiritual practice. The sameness of the dharmas
[is shown] through the two realities of characteristic and representation. The sameness
of enlightenment [is shown] through the reality of purification. The sameness of
wisdom is demonstrated through the reality of correct spiritual practice. Hence it is
said:
The sameness of sentient beings is pro-
claimed through the three, but the sameness
of the dharmas through the two. Thus the
sameness of enlightenment and wisdom is
demonstrated singly.

10. The Reality of the Skills.
The reality of the skills is said to act as the counteragent to false
views. What are the tenfold false views concerning the self [which
manifest] in regard to the aggregates etc.?
III.15 abcd & 16 ab
The false views concerning the self
[which manifest] in regard to these
[aggregates etc.] are in relation to:
(a) oneness, (b) causality, (c) an
experiencer, (d) an agent, (e) inde-
pendence, (f) sovereignty, (g) per-
mancnce, (h) a basis for defilement
and purification, (i) a yogi and (j)
release and non-release.
180
There are ten kinds of
skill that act as the counteragents to these ten
kinds of adherence to the belief in a non-existent self which manifests
in regard to the aggregates etc. These [adherences] are: (a) The adher-
ence to the belief in its oneness. (b) The adherence to the belief in its
causality. (c) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an experi-
encer. (d) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an agent.
(e) The
adherence to the belief in its independence. (F) The adherence to the
belief in its sovereignty. (g)
The adherence to the belief in its perma-
nence. (h) The adherence to the belief in its defilement or purification.
(i) The adherence to the belief in its nature as a yogi. (j) The adher-
ence to the belief in its release or non-release.
How can this tenfold reality of skills be included within basic real-
ity? Because the aggregates etc. are included in the three natures. How
are they included?
III.16 cd
The former are [included] within the
latter by way of: (a) the imaginary,
(b) conceptual differentiation and (c)
real nature.
Form is threefold: (a) Imaginary form, i.e. the imaginary nature that
belongs to form. (b) Conceptually differentiated form, i.e. the other-
dependent nature that belongs to form since it is in relation to that
[nature] that [an entity] is conceptually differentiated as form.
(c) Form
as real nature, i.e. the perfected nature that belongs to form. The
aggregates, such as sensation, and also the elements and sense-fields
}181
etc. should be construed in the same way as form [has been construed
above]. Thus, since the aggregates etc. are included within the three
natures the tenfold reality of skills should also be understood in rela-
tion to basic reality. Although it has been stated that the skill in the
aggregates etc. acts as the counteragent to the ten kinds false view in
regard to the self, the meaning of the aggregates etc. has not been
stated. This will now be discussed.
[Sthiramati]
Y135.19 [1] The reality of the skills was listed immediately after the reality of differentiation 161,
so in order to clearly illustrate this he says: the reality of the skills is said to act
as the counteragent to false views 162. Moreover, since it is not known as to
how the tenfold false views concerning the self [manifest] in regard to the aggregates
etc., he asks: which are the tenfold false views concerning the self [that
manifest] in regard to these163 [aggregates etc.]? Hence he says:
III.15 abcd & 16 ab
The false views concerning the self
[which manifest] in regard to these
[aggregates etc.] are in relation to:
(a) oneness, (b) causality, (c) an
experiencer, (d) an agent, (e) inde-
pendence, (f) sovereignty, (g) perma-
nence, (h) a basis for defilement and
purification, (i) a yogi and (j) release
and non-release. 164

It is the fact that [these false views arise] in regard to the aggregates etc. that is referred
to. However, these ten kinds of adherence to the belief in a non-existent
self165...; this says that there is the adherence to the belief in what is non-existent

because the self does not exist.166 [Objection]: If the self does not exist how do these
adherences which are dependent upon the other, i.e. the apprehended object, manifest,
when they are devoid of an object? [Response]: But they are not devoid of an object;
they manifest in regard to the aggregates etc. Therefore, it is said that there
are ten kinds of skill in regard to the aggregates etc. which act as the counter-
agents to these167. How does this adherence [manifest] in regard to just the aggre-
gates etc. although the self cannot be positively determined to exist? Because, when it
is closely examined through reasoning, the self that is separate from the aggregates etc.
cannot be discerned; indeed all the deeds and essential nature that belong to the self,
which those who believe in the self maintain, manifest only in regard to the aggregates
etc. Hence it is evident that it is just the aggregates etc. which form the substratum for
the adherence to the belief in the self. Since this adherence to the self, on the part of
those who are notionally attached to the self168, manifests in these ten forms and not in
others, the skills in regard to the aggregates etc. should be understood as the counter-
agent to all adherence to the belief in the self. These [adherences] are 169: (a) The
adherence to the belief in its oneness; this is due to the adherence to the belief
in the self as a whole entity among the five aggregates that have been appropriated.
The skill in the aggregates acts as the counteragent to this. (b) The adherence to
the belief in its causality; the adherence to the belief in causality in regard to the
self is because sight and the like promote [such an adherence]. The skill in regard to
the elements (dhātu)170 acts as the counteragent to this. The adverse [adherence] and
its counteragent should be stated similarly in regard to the other [sense faculties].
Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its causality 171 [is also explained as] the
notion that everything proceeds from the self; i.e. the adherence to the belief in its
causality refers to the volition that consists in the notion that the self is the cause of
virtuous and non-virtuous action for which there is an agreeable or disagreeable result
in this birth¹72. (c) The adherence to the belief in its nature as an experi-
encer; [the notion that] the self is the agent of experience because it consists in voli-
tion, but the 'manifest' and 'unmanifest' [of the Samkhya] 173 is an object of experience
because it does not consist in volition. Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its
nature as an experiencer refers to the notion that an internal agent of virtuous and non-

virtuous actions is the experiencer of the result of those [actions]. (d) The adher-
ence to the belief in its nature as an agent; the belief that the self is the
agent174 of properly performed and wrongly performed actions. Alternatively, the
adherence to the belief in its agency refers to the notion that the self possesses instru-
mentality etc.175 (e) The adherence to the belief in its independence¹76; [the
notion that] the self exerts influence of its own accord; i.e. the notion that it is the self
that holds sway. Alternatively, the adherence to the belief in its independence refers to
the notion that it exerts an influence in the production of the result which is in confor-
mityli
177 with the cause. (f) The adherence to the belief in its sovereignty; the
notion that the self is the ruler, the master, or the iśvara. Alternatively, the adherence to
the belief in its sovereignty refers to the notion that the self rules over activity that con-
forms with the result178. (g) The adherence to the belief in its perma-
nence 179; the notion that, although it is impure in terms of the five entities beginning
with cause, the self is definitely permanent, otherwise there would be the imputation of
action not performed and the loss of action that has been performed 180 [i.e. if there is
no ātman, an action performed by A would be imputed to B and the result of an action
performed by A would not be obtained by A] and similarly there would be an absence
of memory and recognition. (h) The adherence to the belief in its defilement
and purification; because [one would believe that] it is the basis of defilement and
purification. (i) The adherence to the belief in its nature as a yogi; yoga is
the fixation of the mind upon the self or the suppression of the breath and the mind.
Yoga is the special union of self with mind a yogi means one who has it [i.e. yoga].
And (j) the adherence to the belief in its release and non-release; i.e. the
conceptual differentiation that the self is liberated from a previous [state of]
bondage 181

reality? 183 Because kill refers to proficiency¹84 in regard to the aggregates etc.
How can this be included within the three natures? This question is posed by one who
thinks this to be impossible185. Because the aggregates etc. are included in
the three natures. The fact that [the aggregates] relate to the domain of the skills is
shown by the word "skill", but they do not relate to skill alone; hence the reality of the
skills should be understood as being included therein by way of connection, but not by
way of own-being. Just as the truth of the path, which consists in the reality of the
cause and result, is said to be included within the three [natures]. Although this may
be so,
it is not known just how they are included, hence it is asked: how are they
included?186 Hence he says:
III.16 cd
It is the fact that the aggregates etc. are included within these three natures that is
referred to. In this context, the inclusion of the aggregates is to be elucidated firstly
because they were listed prior to the elements etc. and since they pertain to form, he
says: form is threefold. How so? As: (a) imaginary form, (b) conceptually differ-
entiated form and (c) form as real nature. What is (a) imaginary forml
188 therein? It
is the imaginary nature belonging to form; i.e. that which, with the exception
of its perception by way of name, is imagined in this regard as the own-being of the
sense-object. Because this is absolutely non-existent it is described as imaginary. (b)
Conceptually differentiated form, i.e. the other-dependent nature
belonging to form; what is meant is: it is dependent upon causes and conditions.
But why is this described as conceptually differentiated form? Hence he says: since
it is in relation to that [nature] that [an entity] is conceptually differen-
tiated as form. Due to a failure in clear comprehension 189 on account of their lack
of insight into reality, people are notionally attached to form because of the fact that
they perceive consciousness in the appearance of form 190. just as form [i.e. as matter,
The former are [included] within the
latter by way of: (a) the imaginary,
(b) conceptual differentiation and (c)
real nature. 187

pure and simple], as for instance, one grasps at a self among the aggregates. There-
fore, it is said that form is conceptually differentiated in relation to the other-dependent
[nature]. (c) Form as real nature, i.e. the perfected nature that belongs to
form. This refers to emptiness whose nature is devoid of both imaginary form and
conceptually differentiated form. The aggregates, such as sensation, and also
the elements and sense-fields etc. 191 should be construed in the same
way as form [has been construed above], i.e. in the same way that form is
included in the three natures after having differentiated it as threefold. [By "etc." is
meant]: the aggregates that consist in sensation, perception, the formative forces and
consciousness, as well as the elements, the sense-fields, the limbs of dependent origi-
nation, the worthy and unworthy objects, the sense faculties, the three times192, the
four truths, the three vehicles and both the conditioned and the unconditioned. More-
over, [all] that pertains to sensation etc. and the elements etc., individually, are to be
included in the three natures after distinguishing them as threefold according to the
differences in their essential natures as imaginary 193, conceptually differentiated and
real nature.
[3] Therein, in the same way that [an entity] in the appearances of form is imagined as
the apprehended object, [so too] that absolutely non-existent existence of apprehending
subject and apprehended object, which is imagined in relation to the appearances of
sensation etc., is [described as] imaginary sensation, up to and concluding with imagi-
nary consciousness. Conceptually differentiated sensation, up to and concluding with
conceptually differentiated consciousness, refers to that [sensation] in regard to which
the conceptual differentiation as apprehending subject and apprehended object is
performed. Sensation as real nature refers to the perfected nature pertinent to
sensation; it is to be understood in the same way [for the other aspects] up to and con-
cluding with consciousness as real nature. In detail, it should be stated in the same
way, according to the circumstances, in regard to the elements and sense-fields etc.
[4] An entity that is to be nominally designated as form or sensation, and so on up to
and concluding with the conditioned and unconditioned, should also be understood as
consisting in the imaginary, the other-dependent and the perfected 194 natures. How so?
The imaginary consists therein because [an entity] is designated as of the essential
nature of form etc. The other-dependent [consists therein] since it is this which is the
support for the designation because it depends upon other causal conditions. That
which is absolutely devoid of an entity of form etc. is the perfected.

[5] [Objection]: Since only the other-dependent [nature] is nominally described as an
entity of form etc.195 and the imaginary is not, the conceptual differentiation of the
imaginary is meaningless. [Response]: It is not meaningless because the essential
nature of form etc. is superimposed on that [i.e. the imaginary nature] since the object
does not exist in exactly that way in which 196 the name is used in regard to it; however,
naive people are notionally attached to its essential nature. [Objection]: Why is it that
one is attached to it but not ¹97 as an object [existing] in reality? [Response]: Because
there is the exclusion from the relation of 'signified' and 'signifier' on the part of the
name and the object be they similar or dissimilar; i.e. if the words for trees etc. and
their objects were not different by nature then the name's capacity to signify would be
excluded, like the object, because it would not be distinct from the essential nature of
the object. And the object's capacity to be signified would disappear because it would
not be distinct from the essential nature of the name, due to the absence of a specific
cause [i.e. which causes the existence of that which is to be signified]. Alternatively,
since there would be one 'signifier 198 belonging to the name and a different 'signified'
belonging to the object, there would be an endless series of statements. Moreover, if
there were numerous names for the one object and numerous objects for the one
name199, there would be multiple essential natures; however, it is untenable that the one
[entity] can have multiple natures 200. Moreover, a 'signifier' of non-existence would
not exist, like the object, because the object would be [of the nature of]201 a non-exis-
tent; alternatively, if the name were to exist its object would also exist. In regard to
dissimilarity, there would be no ascertainment of [the existence of an object con-
formable with a word, since in this regard a 'tree' is only a word, it is not an object.
However, the object is not a 'tree' nor is it a 'non-tree'. Therefore, the object of the
word 'tree' is not the sphere of the knowledge of the 'tree' because the object of that
[word] does not have the nature of a tree. In this way202 there is the exclusion of the
word and the object from the relation of 'signified' and 'signifier'. In regard to dispar-
ity, there would be no determination of 'signified' and 'signifier because of the absence
of a determining cause.
[6] There is a theory that the name may generate the object or cause it to become mani-
fest. In this regard, [the name] does not generate [the object] because the name is
applied to the object only after it has arisen. This would lead to the conclusion that,

although the object] has [already] arisen, it would be generated again and again
because the name is applied again and again. Nor does [the name] cause [the object] to
become manifest because the name is applied after the object is apprehended and it is
not tenable that it would cause the manifestation of what has not been apprehended 203,
i.e. another person who does not know an object will not apprehend it with the same
name; also, it is not tenable that that same [name] can cause both the manifestation and
the non-manifestation of the same object. Lamps etc. which cause things to become
manifest do not cause the manifestation of a manifest204 object in dependence upon
knowledge 205. Also, since no determining cause of manifestation is seen in regard to
manifest206
pots and clothing etc., all objects would be caused to manifest by all names.
Moreover, there would be no determination by way of smell etc.207 because axes and
water etc. are considered to be agents that generate smell etc., but not things that cause
manifesta Therefore, it is evident that the notional attachment to the 'signified' and
'signifier', like the notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending
subject208, is meaningless.
[7] Thus, since the aggregates etc. are included within the three natures,
the tenfold reality of the skills should also be understood in relation to
basic reality. Although it has been stated that the skill in the aggregates
etc. 209
acts as the counteragent to the tenfold false views in regard to the
self, the meaning of the aggregates etc., in regard to which the skill in the
aggregates etc. is the counteragent to the adverse views regarding self210, has not
been stated, hence this will now be discussed.

Now at the beginning these, i.e. the aggregates, should be under-
stood in a threefold sense: (a) In the sense of 'multiple'; in detail it is
said: "any form belonging to the past, present or future..." (b) In the
sense of 'collected'; i.e. [the same scriptural reference continues]:
"...after collecting all that [form] together..." And (c) in the sense of
'disparate'; because the characteristic of form etc. is respectively deter-
mined as separate. For 'aggregate' (skandha) has the sense of 'heap'
(răsi) and thus is it generally understood in the sense of a 'heap'.
[Sthiramati]
[1]
At the beginning [they are consid-
ered in the sense of: (a) multiple,
(b) collected and (c) disparate;
The term: "at the beginning"211 refers to the fact that [the aggregates] are stated initially.
Now at the beginning these, i.e. the aggregates are described and they
should be understood in a threefold sense: (a) In the sense of
'multiple'212; [in detail it is said]: "any form213 belonging to the past,
present or future, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or exalted, distant or
near..."214; thus [they should be understood] in the sense of 'multiple' because numer-
ous substantial entities of the past etc. 215 are described by the word 'aggregate'. The
aggregates [should be understood]; (b) in the sense of 'collected' because of the
scriptural statement: "...after collecting together...". By "after collecting
...together" is meant: after making into one216. (c) In the sense of 'disparate'; it
is the aggregates that are referred to. The word "and" has a collective sense, i.e. this
belongs with the previous two statements: i.e. in the sense of 'multiple' and in the sense
of 'collected'. Here now he gives the reason: because the characteristic of form
etc. 217, belonging to the aggregates, is respectively determined as separate,
from the characteristic of sensation etc. The words "separate" and "disparate" are
synonyms. What is the reason that in this context the meaning of the aggregates is
respectively determined in terms of these three aspects? For 'aggregate' (skandha)

has the sense of 'heap' (rasi)218, hence, and thus is it generally under-
stood, i.e. established. Thus, what is generally understood as 'multiple', 'collected'
and 'disparate' is described as a 'heap'. The aggregates of sensation etc. are to be
understood in the same way as the aggregates of form. Therein, an act of skill in
regard to the meaning of the aggregates is described as the counteragent to the adher-
ence to the belief in a unique self, namely, such as that all this that has been and will be
in the future is none other than the puruşa [of the Samkya]. How so? Because form
etc., differentiated as belonging to the past etc. and collected together as a unity, is
designated as the aggregate of form etc. Moreover, the aggregates are respectively
determined as threefold as counteragents to three kinds of confusion; the three kinds of
confusion are: (a) confusion in regard to singularity, (b) confusion in regard to the
conventional and (c) confusion concerning the mixture of characteristics.

b. The Meaning of the Elements.
The next is considered in the sense
of the 'seed' of: (a) the apprehending
subject, (b) the apprehended object
and (c) the perception of the latter.
What is next? The elements. In the above, (a) the sense of the 'seed'
of the apprehending subject refers to the elements of sight etc.; (b) the
sense of the 'seed' of the apprehended object refers to the elements of
form etc.; and (c) the sense of the 'seed' of the perception of the latter
refers to the elements of sight-consciousness etc.

meaning of the elements immediately following the meaning of the aggregates.

subject, (b) the apprehended object

The word "next" in this context219 refers to the elements since they were listed immedi-
ately after the aggregates; this is why the author of the commentary also says: what is
next? The elements. 'Element' (dhātu) has the sense of 'seed' (bija); accordingly,

when there is gold220 it is said to be the element gold the 'seed' of gold is thus under-
stood. Moreover, this is distinguished as threefold because of the difference in result:
(a) the element that consists in the apprehending subject, (b) the element that consists in
the apprehended object and (c) the element that consists in the perception of the latter.
In the above, (a) the sense of the 'seed' of the apprehending subject
refers to the element of sight etc.221; the element of sight is the first of the
elements which begin with sight and conclude with mind. They are [described as]
apprehending subjects because they form the basis for the perception of sense-objects
of form etc. They are described as elements because they are the cause of [the elements
of sight etc. of the same genus. (b) The sense of the 'seed' of the appre-
hended object refers to the elements of form etc., concluding with the non-
sensuous element. Because they are the objects of sight-consciousness etc. 222 they are
[described as] apprehended objects. These too are described as elements because they
are thus causes [in the production] of the form etc. of a similar nature. (c) The sense
of the 'seed' of the perception of the latter refers to the elements of
sight-consciousness etc.; the perceptions regard to form etc. are those which
begin with sight-consciousness and conclude with mind-consciousness because they
have the knowledge of form etc. for their own-being. These too are described as ele-
ments because they are causes [in the production] of the sight-consciousness etc. of a
similar nature, i.e. beginning with the element of sight-consciousness and concluding
with the element of mind-consciousness.
[2] However, others say223 that the store-consciousness, imbued with the latent
impressions of 224 the karma of notional attachment to sight etc., is the 'seed' of those
respective [elements] of sight etc. Similarly, the store-consciousness, imbued with225
[the latent impressions of 226 the karma inherent to the notional attachment to form etc.,
is the 'seed' of those respective [elements] of form etc. Likewise, just the store-
consciousness, imbued with the latent impressions of the karma inherent to the
notional attachment to sight-consciousness etc., is the 'seed' of those respective
[elements] of sight-consciousness etc. [Objection]: If this is so, the following should
be reflected upon: it would be just the store-consciousness that is signified by the word
"element" and not (the faculty of sight etc. [Response]: The elements have been
respectively determined in this threefold sense as 'seed' in order to remove confusion
concerning: (a) the agent, (b) the deed and (c) the karma. In this respect, the former

[element of] sight etc. is the cause of just the latter [element of sight etc. and there is

elements.

c. The Meaning of the Sense-Fields.
The next [is considered] as the
medium of origination for the experi-
ence of: (a) sensation and (b) the
discrimination of an object;
What is next? The sense-fields. Of these, the six internal sense-
fields [are considered] in the sense of the medium of origination for the
experience of sensation. The six external [sense-fields are considered]
in the sense of the medium of origination for the experience of the dis-
crimination of an object.
[Sthiramati]
Y144.19 [1] The meaning of the sense-fields should be mentioned immediately following the
meaning of the elements, hence he says:
III.18 ab
The next [is considered] as the
medium of origination for the experi-
ence of: (a) sensation and (b) the
discrimination of the object;227
Since there are numerous [topics] apart from the elements such as the sense-fields and
dependent origination and also because of the general nature of the word "next", he
poses the question: what is next? This word "next", as a matter of course, stands
just for the sense-fields because they were listed immediately following the elements,
thus in order to show this, he says: it refers to the sense-fields. Of these, the
six internal sense-fields [are considered] in the sense of the medium of
origination for the experience of sensation228. The six external sense-
fields [are considered] in the sense of the medium of origination for the
experience of the discrimination of the object. The medium of origination
(āyadvāra) is equivalent in meaning to sense-field (ayatana). Origination (āya) is

192
[equivalent to] an arrival; they are sense-fields (ayatanăni) insofar as they propagate
(tanvanti) that [which originates] among the experience of sensation and the discrimi-
nation of an object. This differentiation as internal and external is according to the
difference in the medium of origination for an experience either as sensation or
conceptualization. Sensations are either pleasurable, painful or neither pleasurable nor
painful. Because the latter are partaken of (upabhujyate), they are [described as]
enjoyment (upabhoga); what is meant is: they are experienced (anubhūyate). Only the
internal sense-fields 229 are described as the medium of origination 230 for that experi-
ence of sensation because, although the sense-objects are the medium of the origination
of that [sensation], the support231 i.e. sight etc., is the basis on account of the fact that:
(a) it is helpful or obstructive, (b) it consists in clear comprehension in regard to that
[sensation] and (c) it is specific, since the experience of sensation [occurs] by means of
it when there is sight etc. and [the experience of sensation] does not [occur] when there
is no [sight etc. 1232. The discrimination of an object refers to conceptualization
(samjñā) because it has the nature of the apprehension of the sign of the object. This
consists in the experience of sense-objects 233 because it has the nature of the know-
ledge of objects. The external sense-fields are described as the medium of origination
for those [conceptualizations]; but not the internal [sense-fields], for, even if they were
the medium of origination for those [conceptualizations], in the absence of a sense
object, there is no experiencing of the discrimination of the object234 even if the internal
sense-fields of sight etc. do exist. The sense-fields should be known because they are
the medium of origination for both sensations and the discrimination of objects
together with their associated elements.
[2] The two apprehendings are very important. Furthermore, apprehending is very
important because it consists in the experience of the result of karma and also because
it consists in the discrimination of objects. Since there is the conceptual differentiation
of an agent of experience on account of the experience of sensation and the discrimina-
tion of objects, the sense-fields are respectively determined 235 in a twofold sense.
Thus, skill in the sense-fields [leads to the understanding that] the agent of experience
consists in the internal sense-fields and the object of experience consists in the external
sense-fields. And since no other236 agent of experience exists, the adherence to the
belief in the self as the agent of experience is checked.

[3] [Objection]: The assertion that was made above is not tenable, i.e. that because the
sense-fields of sight etc. are helpful or obstructive it is just the support of that
[sensation] which is conventionally expressed as the agent of experience because, on
account of the denial of [the existence of] form, the sense-fields of sight etc. would
also not exist, like the self. [Response]: This censure is not appropriate because it is
only imaginary form that is denied here, not conceptually differentiated form. In the
above, the internal sense-field is the store-consciousness which undergoes a special
transformation on account of its projection by the karma that is imbued with the
conceptual elaborations of sight etc. The external sense-field is the appearance as form
etc. and belongs to the actual consciousness which has the latter [i.e. the store-
consciousness] as its cause. The appearance as a common object and the237 appearance
as sentient beings belong to the store-consciousness and are described as the external
sense-field because they are the predominant-causal conditions in the arising of the
actual consciousness which appears as the apprehended object and apprehending
subject. However, it is not because these [external sense-fields] consist in the sense
object.
[4] [Objection]: Is it not so that this (interpretation] conflicts with the words of the
Sūtras which state that sight-consciousness and the like are produced in dependence
upon the two [i.e. sense faculty and external object]? The appearance as form etc.238 is
different from consciousness and it is not tenable that it alone can be the causal condi-
tion for the arising of just itself because of the existence of the arisen and the non-
existence of the non-arisen states239, and because action in regard to itself is contra-
dictory. Therefore, form and the like should necessarily be acknowledged as being
different from their appearances in consciousness. [Response]: This censure is not
appropriate because consciousness in the appearance of form etc. deposits the (causal)
latent impression 240 in the causal consciousness for the arising of a consciousness of a
similar nature; and due to a transformation in the latent impression, consciousness in
the appearance of form etc. is born again. In this way, consciousness, when it has
deposited a latent impression in the nature of an appearance of form etc.241, is
described as the causal condition for consciousness, hence there is no contradiction
with the Sutras. Thus, the meaning of 'support', too, is appropriate for the appearance
as form etc. because it is the causal condition for consciousness in (the aspect of 242 its
own appearance. Alternatively, that which is innate to consciousness is established as

the objective support-causal condition by those who hold to the [existence of the]
external object by way of connection with the fact that the existence or non-existence of
consciousness is due to the existence or non-existence of that [causal condition for the
objective support] although there is no relation of producer and produced. Similarly,
here too, although the appearance of form etc. and consciousness do not have243 the
relation of that which is produced and producer, they are respectively determined as the
causal condition and the possessor of the causal condition because there is no falla-
cious reasoning regarding the existence or non-existence of consciousness as being
due to the existence or non-existence of that [causal condition for the objective
support].
[5] [Objection]: There would be no actual correspondence with an example for both
the appearance of form etc. and consciousness because they cannot be differentiated.
[Response]: This is not so because they are figurative differences244; for example, the
consciousness of dreams, magical creations and cities of Gandharvas and the like,
although ultimately undifferentiated, is respectively determined in the relation of that
which is supported and the supporter just as it is (conventionally)245 differentiated in
the aspects of apprehended object and apprehending subject because it is the basis for
the conceptual differentiation of apprehended object and apprehending subject. Like-
wise, there is no contradiction in the other cases too. Moreover, the relation of that
which is supported and the supporter is, in all cases, only expressed figuratively; it
does not actually exist. Because, whether consciousness has or has not arisen, it does
not take a sense-object as objective support due to the fact that this [object] passes
away immediately upon origination since [in the former case] it does not continue to
exist at the time of the act of supporting and because [in the latter case] it does not
exist. Also, the sense-object is not tenable as the objective support whether it has or
has not arisen or has both [arisen and not arisen], because: (a) it does not continue to
exist when it has arisen and (b) that which has not arisen does not exist, since the act of
supporting devoid of a foundation is not tenable. An objective support for the
presently existing consciousness is meaningless since it is through the mere fact of its
existence that the relation of cause and result is determined 246 as the relation of that
which is supported and the supporter because it is established as having the nature of
that [which is supported]. Also, [the objective support] for that [consciousness] which
is in the process of arising is meaningless because it does not [yet] exist. [Objection]:
[an objective support for that consciousness] in the process of arising is not meaning-

less because when the sense-object really exists, consciousness acquires the nature of
an appearance as the latter. [Response]: If the appearance as the object were caused by
an object that is external to consciousness, then the consciousness of things belonging
to the past, the future or to dreams would be devoid of aspect (niräkära), or else would
not exist because of the non-existence of the object of those [things belonging to the
past etc.]. An effect cannot be produced by causal conditions that are deficient247 since
this would transcend the bounds of logic248 and the assertion that something non-exis-
tent can possess a causal condition is also not tenable. Moreover, the external object is
not the causal condition of the objective support for consciousness since the latter
exists even without the former. Therefore, all consciousness of people who have
ophthalmia is to be acknowledged as having no dependence on an objective support
that consists in the external object.

The meaning of dependent origination:

[It is considered in the sense of the
absence of both imputation and
negation in regard to cause, result
and activity.
Dependent origination is considered] in the sense of the absence of
both the imputation and negation of cause, result and efficacy. In this
respect, (a) there is the imputation of causality due to imagining that the
formative forces etc. have dissimilar causes. (b) There is the negation
of causality due to imagining that [the latter] are devoid of causality.
(c) There is the imputation of result due to imagining that the formative
forces etc., together with the self, manifest from causal conditions such
as ignorance. (d) There is the negation of result due to imagining that
the formative forces etc., which have ignorance etc. for their causal
conditions, do not exist. (e) There is the imputation of efficacy due to
imagining that ignorance etc. is instrumental in the production of the
formative forces etc. (f) There is the negation of efficacy due to imag-
ining that [the latter] are devoid of power. The absence of both impu-
tation and negation should be understood as being due to the non-exis-
tence of these [conditions).

Y148.6 [1] Since the meaning of dependent origination should be mentioned immediately after
the meaning of the sense-fields, he says: the meaning of dependent origination:

cause, result
It means: arisen from causal conditions that are inactive, impermanent and have power;
as has been stated in a Sutra: "when this exists, there is that. Due to the arising of this,
that is produced in detail: the formative forces have ignorance for their causal condi-
tion." In order to illustrate that in this context dependent origination is considered by
way of the refutation of the imputation and negation of cause, result and efficacy, he
says: dependent origination [is considered] in the sense of the absence of
both the imputation250 and negation of cause, result and efficacy.
"Efficacy" is stated by the word: "activity".

[2] In this respect, there is the imputation of causality...; this is due to
imagining that the purușa, the iśvara, the atom 251 or the pradhana etc. possess causality,
having rejected ignorance etc. [as the cause]. In order to demonstrate this, he says:
...due to imagining that the formative forces etc., concluding with old-age
and death, have dissimilar causes. "Dissimilar" refers to the notion that some-
thing permanent such as the puruşa can be the cause of the formative forces etc. which
are impermanent; what is meant is: 'different' [i.e. that a cause can produce something
that is of a completely different nature to itself]. Alternatively, a cause is considered to
require a modification of its essential nature, like the seed in relation to the sprout etc.,
but there can be no modification of essential nature on the part of that which is per-
manent. The imputation of causality is due to imagining causality in regard to a [result
that is dissimilar [to its] cause.
[3] There is the negation of causality due to imagining that [the latter]
are devoid of causality 252, ...; if one agrees that the formative forces etc. are
produced without a cause, ignorance etc. is excluded as the cause of the formative
forces etc.-

[4] There is the imputation of result254 due to imagining that the forma-
tive forces etc., together with the self, manifest from causal conditions
such as ignorance. Some believe that the formative forces etc. manifest from
causal conditions such as ignorance if the self exists, but do not [manifest] if it does
not exist. Thus, there is the im tion of result if the self is imputed upon the result
such as the formative forces 255. Others believe that the imputation of result is due to
imagining that the formative forces etc., together with the self, manifest from causal
conditions such as ignorance, either by being intimately connected with a substantial256
self or by being an agent that is beneficial or obstructive257 to the latter.
[5] There is the negation of result due to imagining that the formative
forces etc., which have ignorance for their causal condition, do not
exist258; for example 259, there are heretics who negate good conduct, bad conduct and
other worlds [i.e. subsequent rebirths] believing that there is no good conduct, there is
no bad conduct and there are no other worlds.260
[6] There is the imputation of efficacy due to imagining that ignorance
etc. is instrumental in the production of the formative forces etc. If it is
imagined that in the production of the formative forces etc. ignorance etc. can cause the
nature of an entity to become something other261, then there is imputation of efficacy.
[7] There is the negation of efficacy due to imagining that [the latter]
are devoid of power. There is the negation of efficacy due to imagining that the
formative forces are devoid of power although they have the capacity for origination
through the mere [imputation of the] existence of ignorance etc.
[8] The absence of both imputation and negation should be understood
as being due to the non-existence of these [conditions]. The absence of
imputation and negation should be understood as being due to the absence of that
imputation and negation in regard to cause, result and efficacy 262. Thus, whether [this
belief relates] to a self separately 263 from ignorance etc. or to something else, this skill
in dependent origination should be understood as the counteragent to the adherence to
the belief in an agent. For, there is no self nor anything else in this regard, apart from

ignorance, which is the agent of pure or impure actions. There is no other agent of
consciousness apart from the formative forces. And this should be stated in all cases

formative forces etc. arise from ignorance etc. which is inactive, impermanent and has

e. The Meaning of the Possible and the
Impossible.
The next [is considered] in the sense
of an other-dependence in relation to:
(a) what is not desired, (b) what is
desired, (c) purity, (d) concurrent
births, (e) sovereignty, (f) complete
attainment and (g) behaviour.
The possible and the impossible should be understood in the sense
of a sevenfold dependence upon something other. Of these, (a) there is
dependence upon something other in relation to what is not desired due
to falling into wretched states of existence, although not desiring it, on
account of bad conduct. (b) There is dependence upon something other
in relation to what is desired due to the attainment of propitious states
of existence on account of good conduct. (c) There is dependence upon
something other in relation to purity because of not bringing suffering
to an end by not relinquishing the five hindrances and so on up until
not having cultivated the seven limbs of enlightenment. (d) There is
dependence upon something other in relation to concurrent births of the
two existing simultaneously, i.e. of two tathāgatas or two cakravartins,
since they cannot be born into the one world sphere. (e) There is
dependence upon something other in relation to sovereignty since
women cannot become cakravartins etc. (f) There is dependence upon
something other in relation to complete attainment since a woman can-
not become perfectly enlightened, whether it be individual enlight-
enment or supreme enlightenment. (g) There is dependence upon
something other in relation to behaviour because one endowed with
[sound] views does not engage in [violent]264 behaviour, such as
264 Tib. omits upakrama; cf. D14b.2.199
murder, in contrast to the behaviour of ordinary people. This can be
followed up
detail through a perusal of the Bahudhätuka Sūtra265.
[Sthiramati]
Y150.7 [1] The meaning of the possible and the impossible should be mentioned immediately
following the meaning of dependent origination, hence he says:
III.19 abcd
[The next (is considered) in the
sense of an other-dependence in
regard to]: (a) what is not desired,
(b) what is desired, (c) purity etc.266
The possible and the impossible should be understood in the sense of a
sevenfold dependence upon something other. In the above "possible" is
[equivalent to] 'cause'. "Iimpossible" is [equivalent to] 'absence of cause'. As has been
stated in this verse [from Dhammapada, 223]:
One ought speak the truth and not be angry;
one ought give to a beggar even from a
little267. Through these three proprieties
here in this world one ought proceed to the
presence of the gods.
It is understood that [proprieties (sthāna)] are [equivalent to] causes. Alternatively,
propriety (sthana) is (equivalent to] possibility (sambhava) and impropriety (asthāna)
is [equivalent to] impossibility (asambhava). The skill in these is [equivalent to] skill
in the possible and the impossible. "Dependence upon something other" (päratantrya)
is the state (bhäva) of being dependent upon something other (paratantrasya); what is
meant is: resting upon something other (parāyattatā). Although this is sevenfold it is
included within the three other-dependencies of karma, defilement and rebirth.
Y151
[2] Of these, there is dependence upon something other in relation to
what is not desired...; what is not desired refers to the wretched states of exis-
tence. In order to demonstrate that the attainment of these [states of existence] rests
upon bad conduct268 and is a dependence upon something other, he says: ...due to
falling into wretched states of existence, although not desiring it269, on
account of bad conduct, including actions of body speech and mind, such as the
taking of a life, together with their preparation and consequences. The wretched states
265 Majjhima Nikāya, 115; cf. N's fn. 13 p.46.
266 The Tib. includes all four pädas of this verse.
267 The Ms.(18a.1) suggests a reading of dadyad alpac ca yãcitaḥ in place of dadyad alpo pi yacitaḥ,
Tib. slon la chun yan sbyin bar bya (D262a.6). For further discussion on this verse, see
F.Bernhard: Udänavarga, XX.16 p.274 and J.Brough: The Gandhari Dhammapada, 281 p.262.
Tib. omits duścaritāyattatvam; cf. D262b.1.

269
•200
of existence refers to the hells, the Pretas and animals270. Because of the extreme
suffering271 in these [states], there is no desire on the part of anyone to attain rebirth
there. Since actions are powerful and are the cause of wretched states of existence, on
account of the power of actions alone, one whose conduct is bad attains rebirth in such
places although not desiring it.
[3] There is dependence upon something other in relation to what is
desired due to the attainment of propitious states of existence on
account of good conduct; what is desired refers to the attainment of the propitious
states of existence. The propitious states of existence are those of the gods and
mankind. Good conduct consists in: (a) abstention from the taking of life etc. together
with the preparation and consequences of the latter, (b) acts of generosity, respect and
honour etc. towards teachers, preceptors and those who possess virtue etc. and (c) the
special virtues of love and compassion and the like. There is dependence on something
other since rebirth in the propitious states of existence is dependent upon good conduct
alone, for even those who seek it do not attain a propitious state of existence in any
other way apart from [the practice of] good conduct.
[4] There is dependence upon something other in relation to purity...;
purity refers to the relinquishment of moral defilement272. ...[by not relinquish-
ing] the five hindrances, i.e.: (a) the desire for sensual pleasure, (b) malice, (c)
torpor and drowsiness, (d) excitability and remorse and (e) doubt; they are five after
combining torpor and drowsiness as one, and similarly, excitability and remorse. Non-
specifically, they are hindrances (nivaraṇāni) since they hinder (nivṛṇvanu) the whole-
some side. Specifically, they are hindrances since they respectively conceal: (a) the joy
of setting forth273 [from the household life], (b) correct spiritual practice for one who is
inspired in the right way by fellow brahmacarins towards the actions of body and
speech that conform to that [correct spiritual practice], (c) the absence of fainthearted-
ness at the time of meditative calm, (d) the absence of distraction at the time of exertion
and (e) the state of spontaneity at the time of meditative calm and penetrating insight.
...By not relinquishing; i.e. by not abandoning274, those [hindrances] and so on
up until not having cultivated the seven limbs of enlightenment. He says:

power, the faculties and the powers are also included. ...Because of not bringing
suffering to an end. The end of suffering refers to that [state] where suffering is
non-existent and this is nirväņa277. That this is not brought about is [equivalent to] its
non-attainment; what is meant is: one does not attain nirvāṇa. Alternatively, the end of
suffering refers to the fact that one does not create the suffering pertinent to rebirth, for
one does not create such278 suffering as that from which other suffering is entailed.
The dependence upon something other in regard to purity refers to the fact that it is
subject to the relinquishment of the five hindrances.279
[5] There is dependence upon something other in relation to concurrent
births of two tathāgatas or cakravartins280, existing simultaneously. What is
meant is: both together; ...i.e. of two tathāgatas or two cakravartins, since
they cannot be born into the one world sphere. Some schools believe that
with regard to the two tathāgatas, the world-sphere of 3,000 million worlds is meant;
however, [the world-sphere that consists in the four continents [is meant] in regard to
the two cakravartins. Others believe that the world consisting in the four continents [is
meant] in regard to the two tathāgatas as well.281 For the Buddhas, the Venerable
Ones, display their perfect enlightenment and parinirvāṇa in the world-sphere of 3,000
million worlds through the influence of the Dharma Body, in each world consisting in
four continents, by means of the Transformation Body282. For thus, the aim of the
bodhisattvas, i.e. the possession of death and rebirth283 in one of the worlds that con-
sist in the four great284 continents in the Tuşita realms or among mankind 285, is the
same in regard to the other worlds that consist in the four continents. Therefore, they
believe that the Venerable One, who was perfectly enlightened already in the Akaniştha
realm, displays by means of the Transformation Body: (a) his birth and passing away
in all of the worlds consisting in the four continents which are included in the [world-
sphere of 286 3,000 million worlds and in the Tuşita realms and (b) everything such as
the possession of rebirth among mankind. In this respect the dependency on some-
thing other in regard to concurrent existences refers to the fact that the birth of a
Buddha and a cakravartin depends on unequal productive karma287.

since women288 cannot become cakravarting etc. Because it is only in the
body of a man that the karma conducive to [rebirth as] a cakravartin has the power to
provide the [appropriate] karma result, for a woman289 does not have the capacity to
enjoy the [seven] 'jewels' such as a wife.290 The word "etc." refers to sakra [i.e. Indra]
etc.
202
[7] There is dependence upon something other in relation to complete
attainment since 2 woman291 cannot become perfectly enlightened,
whether it be individual enlightenment or supreme enlightenment.
"Attainment" refers to the realization of: (a) Buddhahood or (b) pratyekabuddha-hood.
The dependence on something other in this context refers to its attainment by a man
and its non-attainment by a woman292, because, like a rhinoceros [i.e. a pratyeka-
buddha], [a woman] is not suited to: (a) become a teacher in the three realms and (b)
have no contact [with people], respectively. Furthermore, [women] are vulnerable to
all kinds of rogues and are unfit for perfect enlightenment without a teacher due to their
scant wisdom.
[8] There is dependence upon something other in relation to behaviour
because one endowed with [sound] views does not commit [violent]
behaviour such as murder293, in contrast to the behaviour of ordinary
people. One endowed with [sound] views is [equivalent to] one who has insight into
the truth. "Murder" 294 refers to the taking of a life. By the word "etc.", the taking of
what is not given and the like are referred to. Those [acts] such as murder which have
the acts of body and speech for their own-being do not manifest on the part of one
who has insight into the truth295 because such a person has relinquished the moral
defilement which causes the arising of bad conduct such as murder296 by means of the
path of vision. These [acts] do manifest on the part of ordinary people since they do

not relinquish these [moral defilements]. Furthermore, they do not relinquish the latter
due to the fact that the path which [acts] as the counteragent to them has not arisen.
[9] Thus, the skill in the possible and the impossible is associated with a dependence
upon something other in relation to what is not desired etc. and is the counteragent to
the adherence to the belief in the independence of the purușa and the iśvara etc. For, if
there were no dependency whatsover, [people] should not fall into wretched states of
existence on account of bad conduct. It should be stated similarly in regard to the other
cases as well.
f. The Meaning of the Faculties.
There are twenty-two kinds of faculties:
III.20 ab
[These are considered] as being for
the purpose of: (a) perception, (b) du-
ration, (c) continuity, (d) experience
and (e) the two purities.
[They are considered] as being for the purpose of [the five begin-
ning with perception and concluding with the two purities, since they
exercise a dominant influence in regard to these [five]. For, (a) there is
the dominant influence of the six beginning with sight in relation to the
perception of sense-objects of form etc. (b) [There is the dominant
influence of the vital faculty in relation to duration since death does
not occur on account of its dominant influence. (c) [There is the domi-
nant influence] of the female and male faculties in relation to the
continuation of the family because these [faculties] exercise a dominant
influence in the procreation of offspring. (d) [There is the dominant
influence] of the faculties of sensation in relation to experience since
one experiences the result of wholesome and unwholesome action. And
(e) [there is the dominant influence] of faith etc. in relation to mundane
purity; [there is the dominant influence] of the faculty of understanding
what has not been understood etc. in relation to supramundane purity.
[Sthiramati]
[1] Since the meaning of the faculties should be mentioned immediately following the
explanation of the meaning of the possible and the impossible, he says: there are
twenty-two kinds of faculties, i.e. beginning with the faculty of sight and204
concluding with the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge. Moreover, in this
context "faculty" (indriya) has the sense of 'dominant influence' (adhipatya). As to
which has dominant influence where, he says:
III.20 ab
[These are considered] as being for
the purpose of: (a) perception, (b) du-
ration, (c) continuity, (d) experience
and (e) the two purities. 297
In this [verse] the word "dominant influence" is to be understood as having been
omitted for metrical reasons; properly298 [it should read]: "as being for the purpose of
exercising a dominant influence upon: ...(e) the two [purities]". Therefore, the author
of the commentary says: since they exercise a dominant influence in regard
to these [five]. The expression: "for the purpose of" (artha) in the statement: "for
the purpose of perception", signifies 'aim' (prayojana). He shows that the faculty
therein is for the purpose of perception 299. The same should be stated, respectively, in
other cases as well. "in regard to these" [means] in regard to the perception of the
object etc. It is a dominant influence since it is a superior power; what is meant is: the
dominant influence is [equivalent to; causality.
[2] The sense-objects of form etc. are those beginning with form and concluding
with the non-sensible. The perception of the latter consists in sight-consciousness
etc. In relation to these, there is the dominant influence of the six beginning
with sight. It is described as a faculty since it is a superior power over colour etc.300
because sight is the basis for the consciousness which differentiates form/colour (rūpa)
without exception. However, the colour blue cannot be the objective support for the
consciousness of the colour yellow etc.- 301 In detail, the same should be stated, respec-
tively, with regard to hearing etc.
[3] [There is the dominant influence] of the vital faculty in relation to
duration. The vital faculty, which is pierced by the latent impressions of previous
karma302 when there is no interrupting condition in the karma result continuum,
consists in the capacity for rebirth in each subsequent moment which corresponds to
each preceding moment. Here now he gives the reason for the fact that there is the

dominant influence of the vital faculty with regard to duration303: since death does
not occur on account of its dominant influence. The absence of death is
[equivalent to the continuance of the homogeneous groups projected by previous
karma. Food and the like are not faculties even though they are instrumental in the
maintenance of life because, in spite of their presence, there is no continued existence
when life is extinguished and also, because in the realm of form and the formless
realm, the presence of continued existence is due only to the vital faculty, even though
there is no bodily nutriment. Moreover, in this case the dominant influence of contact
etc. in relation to continued existence is not tenable because the maintenance of sentient
beings in the conditions of the attainment of cessation and non-consciousness and also
in [induced] non-consciousness is possible, even though contact etc. is absent.
[4] [There is the dominant influence] of the female and male faculties in
relation to the continuation of the family304. Since there is no break in the
continuation of the family when a son is born the continuation of the family refers to
the birth of a son. Now, in order to demonstrate this, he says: because of their
dominant influence in procreation. A certain part of the faculty of touch
receives the title: "female" or "male faculty" because it exerts a particular dominant
influence. Where there is the establishment of the family, there is the presence of the
female faculty and the male faculty and by virtue of these there is no break in the conti-
nuity of the family. Moreover, the family is established among the gods dwelling in
[the realm of] form if the female faculty and the male faculty are present, but not if they
are not present. For, there is no dominant influence in this respect on the part of
gandharvas etc. because there is no capacity for the procreation of sons on the part of
eunuchs etc. who have no female or male faculties305, even if the gandharvas etc. are
present306. Furthermore, food and the like are not faculties because they are not enu-
merated among animate things although they are dominant influences [of sorts].
[5] [There is the dominant influence] of the faculties of sensation in
relation to experience; the fact that this is a dominant influence is understood.
How so? Hence he says: because one experiences the result of wholesome
and unwholesome action. The faculties of sensation are five: pleasure, pain,
gladness, sadness and equanimity. It is [through the dominant influence] of these that
one experiences the result of wholesome and unwholesome karma because they have
the nature of experience, but name / form (nămarūpa) have no dominant influence over
them because they are [only] the ground for sensation. And the state of having them

[i.e. nämarūpal as the ground refers to sensation because of the predominance of the
karma-result.
[6] Mundane purity refers to the relinquishment of the mundane moral defilement.
In regard to this (there is the dominant influence] of faith etc., i.e. of the five
faculties of faith, vigour, mindfulness, meditative concentration and wisdom; that these
are dominant influences remains in force because they are characterized by the mun-
dane path since they are the counteragents to lack of faith etc. Others believe that it is
because they are characterized by [the elements] that are conducive to liberation.
[7] [There is the dominant influence] of the faculty of understanding
what has not been understood etc. in relation to supramundane purity.
The fact that this is a dominant influence remains in force. Supramundane purity refers
to the relinquishment of moral defilement by means of the supramundane path. In
relation to this, there is the dominant influence of three: (a) the faculty of understanding
what has not been understood, (b) the faculty of understanding and (c) the faculty of
the possession of perfect knowledge, for these three are respectively incorporated in
the paths of: (a) vision, (b) meditative development and (c) the adept. Therein, with
reference to which is appropriate according to their differences in being based on the
preliminary stage [of the first dhyana]³07 etc., these nine faculties, i.e. the five begin-
ning with faith as well as mind, happiness, gladness and equanimity, are called: (a) the
faculty of understanding what has not been understood, on the path of vision, (b) the
faculty of understanding, on the path of meditative development and (c) the faculty of
the possession of perfect knowledge308, on the path of the adept.
[8] However, this arrangement is different for the yogäcāra the faculty of under-
standing what has not been understood and the faculty of understanding comprise ten
faculties, i.e., there are ten after adding 'sadness' to the nine mentioned above. How-
ever, the faculty of the possession of perfect knowledge 309 comprises only nine. In
this regard, on the path of preparation which consists in the aids to insight³10, and on
the fifteen moments of the path of vision, there is the faculty of mind and the five
beginning with faith and any one of the faculties of happiness, gladness, sadness and
equanimity3 311, as is appropriate according to their differences in being based on the
preliminary stage [of the first dhyāna] etc. Furthermore, the faculty of sadness³12
should be understood as being included because of the longing for supreme deliver-
ance that follows after the aids to insight, at the time of preparation. These tenfold
faculties, according to which is appropriate, are described as the faculty of under-

standing what has not been understood since they manifest in order to understand a
reality that was not previously313 understood. The same ten kinds of faculties are
described as comprising the faculty of understanding on this the path of one who is
still in training, i.e. extending from the sixteen moments of the path of vision up until
the vajra-like meditative concentration, because there is nothing to be known that was
not previously known. On the path of the adept, the remaining [faculties] with the
exception of the faculty of sadness receive the title [collectively]: 'the faculty of the
possession of perfect knowledge'. Since it is the faculty pertinent to one who
possesses perfect knowledge it is [described as] the faculty of the possession of perfect
knowledge³¹4. In this way the adherence to the belief in a dominant influence in regard
to the purușa, the nārāyaṇa or the iśvara is checked for one who is skilled in the facul-
ties.

The cause therein refers to the cause of rebirth; the result is that which is incorporated
in the rebirth. The experience of the cause is the imparting of the result; the experience
of the result is the expiration of what has been experienced. And since such a cause
and its result pertain to the past, he says: the past time [should be known] in
the sense of the experience of the result and cause317. The future time
[should be known] in the sense of the non-experience of the result and
cause318 in that same mode. Furthermore, the present319 time, i.e. the present
rebirth, should be known in the sense of the experience of the cause,
because the cause has produced a result; and in the sense of the non-experience
of the result, because this result follows the present rebirth. The determination of
the times should be understood as referring to momentariness, for the existing entities,
at every instant, possess the nature of cause and result³20. Therein, the experience of
the cause is due to the production of its own result. The experience of the result is due
to the destruction of the effect³21 immediately following its birth. Thus the subject
under discussion is the fact that the past time [should be understood] in the sense of the
experience of the result and the cause; the future time [should be understood] in the
sense of the non-experience of the result and the cause. The non-experience of the
result and its cause should be known as being due to: (a) the non-production³22 of the
effect and (b) the absence of the destruction of what has not come into being. The
statement: [the present time should be understood] in the sense of the experience of the
cause and the non-experience of the result [means]: (a) the experience of the cause is
due to the production of the effect and (b) the non-experience of the result is due to the
non-destruction of the effect. In this way, the adherence to the belief in the self as
something permanent is checked for one who is skillful in the times because he does
not perceive anything other apart from the times323.

considered] in the sense of sensation together with its cause, consider-
ing that it is said]: "whatever sensation is, in this context it [has the
characteristic] of suffering". Furthermore, the cause of sensation
should be known as the dharmas that pertain to sensation. The truth of
origination [is considered in the sense of the practice caused by that,
i.e. the practice caused by the truth324 of suffering. The truth of cessa-
tion [is considered] in the sense of the appeasement of the [first two.
The truth of the path [is considered] in the sense of the counteragent.

[1] The meaning of the four truths should be mentioned immediately following the
meaning of the three times, hence he says:
III.21 ab
(The next is considered] in the sense
of: (a) sensation together with its
cause, (b) the practice325 caused by
the latter etc.326
It is generally known that sensation has the sense of suffering; also, according to this
statement from a treatise327; "whatever sensation is, in this context it [has the charac-
teristic] of suffering". With regard to the respective determination of the [four] truths,
all sensation together with its cause, be it pleasurable and accompanied by impurity,
painful, or neither pleasurable nor painful, means the truth of suffering; in order to
demonstrate this the author of the commentary says: of these, the truth of
suffering [is considered] in the sense of sensation together with its
cause. Why is it that all sensation is [equivalent to] suffering? He says: consider-
ing that³28 [it is said]: "whatever sensation is, in this context it [has the
characteristic of suffering". These sensations are [equivalent to] suffering since
they have the nature of: (a) the suffering of suffering, (b) the suffering of change and
(c) the suffering of the formative forces, respectively. Alternatively, [sensation is
equivalent to] suffering on account of just the fact that it has the nature of the suffering
of the formative forces. Furthermore, the cause of sensation should be
known as the dharmas that pertain to sensation. The dharmas that pertain to

sensation are those consisting in the sensations of pleasure, pain, and neither pleasure
nor pain. In this way the five aggregates are explained as the truth of suffering.
[2] The truth of origination [is considered in the sense of the practice
caused by the latter³29. The truth of suffering is referred to by "the latter". That
practice on account of which suffering is brought into being consists in the truth of
origination. Moreover, the latter, which has the activities of body, speech and mind for
its essential nature, is preceded by the cause of the craving for sensation and the
dharmas that pertain to sensation. In brief, it has been said that the truth330 of origina-
tion consists in the karma331 that is the source of becoming.
[3] The truth of cessation [is considered] in the sense of the appease-
ment of the [first] two. The [first] two are the truths of suffering and of origina-
tion. The words: "in the sense of the appeasement..." "332 are [equivalent to] 'in the
sense of the non-production.... Thus, since it is characterized by the non-origination of
suffering together with its causes, cessation is described as being twofold: (a) as
possessing a remaining substratum in the sense of the appeasement of origination and
(b) as not possessing a remaining substratum in the sense of the appeasement of
suffering.
[4] The truth of the path..., i.e. the way leading to the cessation of both suffering
and its origination [is considered] in the sense of the counteragent to these
same two which have been referred to, i.e. suffering and its origination. In this way,
since one who is skillful in the truths has an understanding of defilement and purifica-
tion alone, his adherence to the belief in defilement and purification other than this is
checked because [he understands that] it does not exist.

The next are to be known because
one goes forth through the know-
ledge of virtues and faults and
[through direct intuition] devoid of
conceptual differentiation [learnt]
from others or by oneself;

[The next are the three vehicles, respectively. Of these, the śrāvaka
vehicle [should be known] because one goes forth [as a mendicant],
having learnt from others through the knowledge of the virtues and
faults of airvāpa and samsāra. The pratyekabuddha vehicle [should be
known] because one goes forth on one's own, without having learnt
from others, through that same [knowledge]. The universal vehicle
should be known because one goes forth on one's own through direct
intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.
[Sthiramati]
Y159.15 [1] The meaning of the three vehicles is illustrated immediately following the meaning
of the truths, hence he says:
III.22 ab-
...Through [the knowledge] of
virtues and faults and [direct intu-
ition] devoid of conceptual differen-
tiation³33 etc.
The word "knowledge" is understood with both, i.e. (a) as the knowledge of virtues
and faults and (b) as the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation. Alterna-
tively, the words '[knowledge that consists in conceptual differentiation can be
regarded as having been omitted from (a). It should be mentioned that in (a) above [the
word "knowledge" has the sense of] the knowledge of virtues and faults after distin-
guishing it as [being learnt] from others or on one's own. Since that which is devoid
of conceptual differentiation is only learnt by oneself, in the commentary he says:
respectively. Of these, ...through the knowledge of the virtues and
faults of nirväņa and samsāra. The word "nirvāņa" in this context includes
both the path and cessation, as does the word "tranquillity". Therein, the knowledge of
virtue in relation to nirvana refers to knowledge that is: (a) in the aspects of tranquillity
etc. 334 in regard to cessation and (b) in the aspects of definitive liberation etc. in regard
to the path 335. Although samsāra has the nature of both suffering and its origination,
therein, the knowledge of faults in relation to samsāra refers to knowledge that is: (a)
in the aspects of impermanence and suffering etc. and (b) in the aspects of origination
and causal conditions etc. Having learnt from others...; i.e. having learnt of the
virtues and faults of nirvana and samsăra, as have been described 336 from the Buddhas
and bodhisattvas etc.. Because one goes forth [as a mendicant]...; i.e. because
one departs from samsāra, the śrävaka vehicle [should be known]; i.e. because

margin.N48.6
212
one goes forth relying on the utterances of others. By the term "śrāvaka vehicle", he
shows that it is distinct from the pratyekabuddha vehicle.
[2] Through that same knowledge of the virtues and faults of nirvāṇa and samsāra
because one goes forth on one's own, not having learnt 337 from
others 338, i.e. from the Buddhas and bodhisattvas, the pratyekabuddha vehicle
[should be known]. By the words: "on one's own, not having learnt from
others "339, [he shows that] it is distinct from the śrävaka vehicle.
[3] Through direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation...; direct
intuition is devoid of conceptual differentiation because it penetrates the ineffable real
nature of samsāra and nirvana; the universal vehicle should be known
because one goes forth just on one's own without having learnt from others. In
this context, the term "direct intuition" distinguishes this from the pratyekabuddha
vehicle.
[4] However, others believe: (a) the śrävaka vehicle is [described as] a going forth
through the direct intuition which has the insubstantiality of the personal entity for its
object and consists in an absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to virtues and
faults, after having learnt from others, (b) the pratyekabuddha vehicle [is described as]
a going forth on one's own without dependence upon³40 learning [from others) and (c)
the universal vehicle is described as a going forth on one's own through direct intuition
which is devoid of conceptual differentiation, having the insubstantiality of the
dharmas for its object and leading to the nirvāṇa [in which the bodhisattva is] not per-
manently fixed. However this explanation³41 is contradicted by the commentary.
In this way the adherence to the belief that the self is a yogi is checked for one who
possesses skill in the three vehicles due to the observation that there is just yoga.

tranquillity
[The final topic] refers to the conditioned and the unconditioned.
The words: "in accompaniment with its designation" in this [verse]
refer to the name-group etc. The "cause" refers to that in which the
'seeds' are incorporated, i.e. the store-consciousness. The "causal-sign"
refers to that in which the support, the body and experience are incor-
porated. Those [elements] that are incorporated in the actual
consciousnesses are: (a) mind, (b) apprehending and (c) conceptual
differentiation. This the causal-sign, in accompaniment with both its
designation and cause together with its associated elements, is to be
known as the conditioned. Therein, "mind" refers to the aspect of
mental activity that is eternal; "apprehending" refers to the five groups
of consciousness; "conceptual differentiation" refers to the mind-con-
sciousness because it is this that conceptually differentiates.
The unconditioned refers to: (a) cessation which is [equivalent to]
tranquillity and (b) the object of tranquillity, i.e. thusness. [Therein,
tranquillity refers to both cessation and the path, considering that the
former [i.e. cessation] consists in tranquillity and tranquillity is on
account of the latter [i.e. the path]. Thusness is the object of tran-
quillity (prašamārtha), considering that it is the object of tranquillity
(praśamasya artha)]342 because thusness is the objective support of the
path. Tranquillity belongs to the path because tranquilization [occurs]
on account of it.

Thus, it is in these meanings that the knowledge in regard to the
aggregates etc. should be known as the skill in the aggregates etc.

tioned, he says:

The final [topic] is declared as being
due to: (a) the causal-sign in accom-
paniment with both its designation
and cause and (b) tranquillity
together with its object.343
The passage marked by parenthesis (N48.15-17) is not found in the Tib. Bhasya (cf. D15a.7)
although portions of it are glossed by the Tika; cf. Nagao's fn.7 p.48.

saprajnaptisahetukam /
nimittam praśamaḥ sarthaḥ pašcad eva prakasitam // Cf. Bhäşya N48.6.214
What is this that is listed as the final [topic]? He says: it refers to the conditioned
and the unconditioned because this was listed at the very end. Therein, the condi-
tioned is determined as being due to the causal-sign in accompaniment with its desig-
nation and cause; whereas, the unconditioned is determined as being due to tranquillity
together with its object. Moreover, in order to clearly illustrate the designation, cause
and causal-sign since they are not known, he says: The words: "in accompani-
ment with its designation"344 refer to the name-group etc.
The name-group
and sentence-group consist in the designation since the own-being and particular of
things are designated through the name-groups and sentence groups 345; but the sylla-
ble-group consists in the designation because it causes the manifestation of the latter
two. The "cause" refers to that in which the 'seeds' are incorporated, i.e.
the store-consciousness. The latter, which is endowed with the latent
impressions of all impure dharmas and is not the imparted result, is incorporated in the
truth of origination. Consequently, in order to distinguish this from the imparted
result, he says: "that in which the 'seeds' are incorporated". The "causal-sign"
refers to that in which the support, the body346 and experience are
incorporated. 347 It is the store-consciousness that is referred to. The [elements]
incorporated in the actual consciousnesses are: (a) mind, (b) appre-
hending and (c) conceptual differentiation348. The "support" in the above
refers to the inanimate world, i.e. the store-consciousness in the appearance of the
latter. It is incorporated 349 as the support since it is incorporated in its nature as the
support. The "body"350 refers to the physical body together with the faculties, i.e. the
store-consciousness in the appearance of the latter. It is that in which the body is
incorporated; what is meant is: it possesses the body for its nature. It is that in which
experience is incorporated this has already been described in the above. It consists in
experience³51 since the other consciousnesses experience these two [i.e. the body and
experience] as being the dominant entities352. Alternatively, it is experience (bhoga)
since food and drink and the like are experienced (bhujyate). That within which expe-
rience is incorporated is the [store]-consciousness in the appearance as the latter. This
the causal-sign, in accompaniment with both its designation and cause
together with its associated elements, is to be known as the conditioned

since it is included in the other-dependent nature. "Together with its associated
elements" 353 refers to the mental concomitants; he shows that the conditioned is not
solely these. But to what does the causal-sign belong? To the name-group etc.
because these clearly indicate the own-being and particular of that [causal-sign] and
since it is in conformity with these [i.e. the name-group etc.], the causal-sign belongs to
the [elements] called mind, apprehending and conceptual differentiation, i.e. the mind
and mental concomitants354 of those who are notionally attached to the own-being and
the particular.
[2] Some believe that mind, apprehending and conceptual differentiation 355 consist in
the causal-sign which belongs to the store-consciousness because the nourishment of
the latent impressions occurs there. Others again believe that since it designates the
own-being and particular, the sign belongs to the designation and consists in concep-
tualization (samjñā) because of the statement356 that it has the nature of the apprehen-
sion of the sign. The store-consciousness which incorporates the support, the body
and experience is the causal-sign of the foundation because there is the nourishment of
the latent impressions [therein]. Mind, apprehending and conceptual differentiation are
also the causal-sign of the objective support because they create the objective support-
sign³57; and since it creates the sign in both cases, the causal-sign belongs to both the
objective support and the supporter358.
[3] Therein, "mind" refers to the aspect of mental activity 359 that is eter-
nal; that which eternally thinks (manyate) in terms of 'me' and 'mine' is described as
mind (manas). It is associated with: (a) delusion regarding the self, false view of the
self, affection for the self and self-conceit and (b) the five all-pervading (dharmas], i.e.
sensation, conceptualization, volition, contact and mental attention. "Apprehending"
refers to the five groups of consciousness because they have the characteristic
of 'seizing the essential nature of the sense-object. Since the latter are to be understood
intuitively and cannot be stated, they are described as 'apprehending'. "Conceptual
differentiation" refers to mind-consciousness because it is this which
conceptually differentiates 360 the characteristic of the dharmas as individual or
universal. All361 of these, the causal-sign in accompaniment with its designation and

cause, consist in the conditioned because they are brought about through karma and
moral defilement.
[4] The unconditioned refers to: (a) cessation which is [equivalent to]
tranquillity and (b) that which is the object of tranquillity, i.e. thusness.
It is appropriate that cessation has tranquillity for its essential nature because it is char-
acterized by the appeasement of suffering together with its causes. Why is thusness
described as the object of tranquillity? Considering that it is the object of
tranquillity. If thusness362 has no connection whatsoever with cessation, how can it
be the object of tranquillity? Because thusness is the objective support of the
path. How is it that tranquillity belongs to the path? Because tran-
quilization363 [occurs] on account of it. Nirvāṇa is [equivalent to tranquillity
because it consists in tranquillity, and since tranquilization364 [occurs] on account of
this [i.e. the path], tranquillity refers to ...the path. Thus, from analysing365 the
resolution of the compound (i.e. praśamārtha) [it is evident that] both nirvāṇa and the
path are referred to through the single expression "tranquillity". But does the truth of
the path consist in the conditioned or the unconditioned? It consists in the conditioned
because it is to be produced 366. If one were to say that it consists in the unconditioned
because: (a) it is not brought about through karma and moral defilement and (b) it is
characterized by the unconditioned, there would be no fault in this. Thus it is in
these meanings that the knowledge in regard to the aggregates etc.
should be known as the skill in the aggregates etc.
At the beginning (they are considered] in
the sense of: (a) multiple, (b) collected and
(c) disparate. (III.17 ab)

The Summary Meaning of Reality.
[Sthiramati]
The summary meaning of reality. In brief, reality is twofold: (a)
mirror reality and (b) visible reality. Mirror reality in this regard is
[equivalent to] basic reality because the others are visible therein.
Visible reality is ninefold: (a) the visible reality free from illusory
notions; (b) the visible reality free from erroneous inversion367; (c) the
visible reality of going forth by means of the śrävaka vehicle; (d) the
visible reality of going forth by means of the universal vehicle because
it brings about maturity by way of the gross and liberates by way of the
subtle; (e) the visible reality of the refutation of opponents because they
are refuted through reasoning based upon example; (f) the visible real-
ity of the lucid explanation of the universal vehicle; (g) the visible real-
ity of entry into the knowable in all aspects; (h) the visible reality of
the lucid explanation of true thusness and (i) the visible reality of
entry368 into all intended meanings in regard to the foundation for the
adherence to the belief in the self.

detail, it has been described as tenfold. Hence in brief, it is twofold371: (a) mirror
reality and (b) visible reality. Mirror reality in this regard is

why it is described as "mirror reality" because the others, i.e. the reality of charac-
teristic etc., are visible therein372. Visible reality which was explained pre-
viously as the reality of characteristic etc. is ninefold. Why is it described as visible
reality? Because it is visible within basic reality. (a) The visible reality free
from illusory notions; i.e. the reality of characteristic, for the freedom from
illusory notions [comes about] on account of this because there is neither imputation
nor negation in regard to: (a) the personal entity and the dharmas, (b) the apprehended
object and apprehending subject and (c) existence and non-existence. (b) The visi-
ble reality free from erroneous inversion 373; i.e. that which is characterized by

the absence of erroneous inversion, for this is the counteragent to erroneous inver-
sion374 such as the notion of permanence. (c) The visible reality of going forth
by means of the śrävaka vehicle; i.e. the reality of cause and result. The going
forth of the śrävaka is via meditative development and the penetration of the four noble
truths. (d) The visible reality of going forth by means of the universal
vehicle; i.e. the reality of the gross and the subtle. One goes forth via the universal
vehicle because it brings beings to maturity by way of the gross, i.e. by way
of conventional truth, and because it liberates them by way of the subtle, i.e.
by way of ultimate truth375. (e) The visible reality of the refutation of oppo-
nents, i.e. well established reality. How so? He says: because they are refuted
through reasoning based upon example 376; examples are generally accepted
when refuting an opponent. It is reasoning since it is based on words 377 that are well
established through reasoning. (f) The visible reality of the lucid explanation
of the universal vehicle; i.e. the reality of the sphere of pure direct intuition, for
this refers to the sphere of the pure direct intuition378 of both obscuration that consists
in moral defilement and the knowable 379 and comprises the lucid explanations of other
scriptural traditions this is the versal vehicle. (g) The visible reality of
entry into the knowable in all its aspects; i.e. the reality of inclusion. More-
over, this refers to the five categories because with reference to them, one enters into all
that is knowable. (h) The visible reality of the lucid explanation of true
thusness380; i.e. the reality of differentiation, for the lucid explanation of both the true
thusness and the unaltered thusness of things is on account of this. (i) The visible
reality of entry by way of all intended meanings 381 in regard to the
foundation for the adherence to the belief in the self; i.e. the reality of the

of Reality, hence the Fourth Chapter is undertaken in order to clearly illustrate these
[subjects]. The State Therein and the Attainment of the Result are stated because: (a)

Meditative Development of the Counteragent.

Counteragent.

Introductory.
The meditative development of the counteragent which is [equivalent
to] the meditative development of the factors that contribute to enlight-
enment should now be mentioned.
[Sthiramati]
[1] In order to demonstrate that in a Sūtra, the factors which contribute to enlighten-
ment are asserted as being counteragents, he says: the meditative development of
the counteragent which is [equivalent to] the meditative development of
the factors that contribute to enlightenment2... For they are described as
counteragents since they gain strength while being cultivated for the relinquishment of
adverse obscuration as described [in Chapter II]. Furthermore, they number thirty-
seven, [beginning with] the four applications of mindfulness up until the noble eight-
limbed path. The meditative development of these is synonymous with: (a) their
promotion, (b) their generation, (c) their practice and (d) their repetition³. [These]
should now be mentioned because they were listed immediately after Reality.

a. The Four Applications of Mindfulness.
Y167
Now, in regard to these, at the beginning:
IV.1 abcd
The meditative development of the
applications of mindfulness leads to
the comprehension of the four truths
and is due to: (a) disquiet, (b) the
cause of craving, (c) the foundation
[of the latter] and (d) the absence of
confusion.
222
on
(a) Disquiet is made manifest through the body; one comprehends
the truth of suffering through the investigation of the latter because [the
body] is characterized by the formative forces together with disquiet;
for, disquiet consists in the painful nature of the formative forces
account of this the Noble Ones regard all impure entities in terms of
suffering. (b) The cause of craving is sensation; through the investiga-
tion of this, one comprehends the truth of origination. (c) Mind is the
foundation for the notional attachment to the self; through the inves-
tigation of this, one comprehends the truth of cessation due to the
removal of the fear of self-annihilation. (d) Through the investigation
of the dharmas one comprehends the truth of the path due to the absence
of confusion concerning the dharmas pertinent to defilement and purifi-
cation. Hence the meditative development of the applications of mind-
fulness is established at the beginning for the comprehension of the
four truths.
[Sthiramati]
Y166.15 [1] Why is the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness described
firstly and not the other, i.e. the meditative development of the factors that contribute to
enlightenment? He says: Now, in regard to these, in the beginning:
IV.1 a
...Due to: (a) disquiet, (b) the cause
of craving etc.
"In regard to these" [means]: in regard to the meditative development of the factors that
contribute to enlightenment. The word "now" has the sense of sequential order. Now,
at the beginning, the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness is
mentioned and [the meditative development of the others [are mentioned] subse-
Read: dauşthulyat tarşahetutväd in place of dauşthulyatṛṣṇahetutvād; cf. Bhāṣya N50.6.Y168
quently. Because they are not aware of the virtues and faults of nirvana andsamsāra
[respectively] on account of their notional attachment to something pleasurable, pure,
permanent and substantial among the formative forces, naive people delight in enjoy-
ment and existence and are fearful of the meaning of nirvāṇa7. Moreover, this lack of
awareness in regard to virtues and faults and the notional attachment to the pleasurable
etc. are checked because of the insight into the truths. Hence, in order to encourage
them to shrink from samsāra and to bring them face to face with nirvāṇa, just the
meditative development of the applications of mindfulness is mentioned at
the beginning for the comprehension of the four truths.
[2] Disquiet is made manifest through the body. Disquiet (dauşthulya) is
[equivalent to] uneasiness (duḥsthitatā) because, while it is formatively influenced
every day, the body is certainly changed; hence disquiet is made manifest through the
body. Consequently, one comprehends the truth of suffering through the
investigation of the body. As to why this is so, he says: because [the body] is
characterized by the formative forces together with disquiets. Since the
formative forces, accompanied by disquiet, are the characteristic, i.e. the own-being, of
the truth of suffering and disquiet is made manifest through the body, therefore, one
comprehends the truth of suffering through the investigation of the body. However,
since disquiet is not understood, he says: for, disquiet consists in the painful
nature of the formative forces. Formative force refers to the arising of states [of
existence]; and since it is the foundation of all ruin, it is disquiet. And this consists in
suffering because it is repugnant to the Noble Ones. As has been said:
This rebirth is unfortunate, for when there is birth, there are the enemies of
old-age, death, disease, misfortune, murder, bondage and so on. These mis-
fortunes would not occur if the body9 did not originate, [just as] there would be
no destruction through fire, wind and forest fires if trees did not arise.
On account of this, i.e. it is on account of the painful nature of the formative
forces, and not on account of the painful nature of change nor the painful nature of
suffering, because: (a) the latter two do not pervade and (b) they are the causes of the
painful nature of the formative forces. The Noble Ones regard all impure enti-
ties in terms of suffering10 but not [entities] that are free from impurity because

the truth of the path is the counteragent to the arising of rebirth. However, ordinary
people¹2 do not [regard impure entities in terms of suffering] because their mental
disposition is impaired by erroneous inversion¹3. The following is stated in a Sūtra
too: "In brief, suffering consists in the five aggregates that have been appropriated."
Others believe that the painful nature of the formative forces is [equivalent to] the lack
of pliability (akarmaṇyata). Others again believe that disquiet does not consist in the
lack of pliability 14. What is the reason? The state of being accompanied by impurity
should necessarily be acknowledged as having arisen from a causal 'seed' because the
lack of pliability15 is accompanied by impurity, however sometimes, even without a
'seed' [lack of pliability] exists in the mental continuum of an arhat due to a defect in
diet, or environment¹6 etc. and this does not have the capacity to become disquiet
because it is free from impurity. Hence, it is the 'seed' of an impure dharma which
lodges in the store-consciousness and is considered as disquiet in this context. This
body, accompanied by [sensations that are] pleasurable, painful and neither pleasurable
nor painful, is the result of that ['seed']. Therefore, disquiet is made manifest through
the body which comes into being every moment accompanied by the state17 of pleasure
etc. The term ["made manifest"] is equivalent in meaning to 'made evident'. For
example, a seed that has slipped into a crack in the floor of a granary [manifests]18
through its sprout. Therefore, one comprehends the truth of suffering through the
investigation of the body. Here now he gives the reason: "because [the body] is char-
acterized by the formative forces together with disquiet" 19. What is meant is: because
[suffering] consists in the formative forces together with their 'seeds'. For, the painful
nature of the formative forces is described as disquiet20 because: (a) it is associated
with the disquiet of both the painful nature of change and the painful nature of suffer-
ing and (b) it is the cause of these two21. Hence, on account of the painful nature of the
formative forces the Noble Ones regard all impure entities in terms of suffering22. In
this way one comprehends the truth of suffering through the application of the mind-
fulness of the body.

[3] The cause of craving is sensation. The intended meaning here is that it
arises from contact which consists in ignorance, because [sensation] that is free from
impurity does not cause such[ craving]. In this respect, a pleasurable sensation is the
cause of the craving for connection with that [sensation] and non-separation from it. A
painful [sensation] is the cause of the craving for separation from that (sensation] and
non-connection with it. [A sensation that is neither pleasurable nor painful is the
cause of: (a) craving for the delight in that state and (b) craving for connection with that
[sensation] and non-separation from it23 in regard to any attainment. Even a painful
sensation is a cause of craving for pleasure since it is said that: "one who has made
contact24 with a painful sensation rejoices in the pleasure of sensual delight." One
comprehends the truth of origination through the investigation of this.
While investigating sensation by way of essential nature, cause, effect, impermanence25
and suffering, one indeed comprehends the truth of origination. What is meant is: one
understands that craving is the effect of these [sensations]. In a Sūtra, craving is
described as the truth of origination; in detail it is said: "What is the origination of
suffering? It is the craving which leads to further existence and which is accompanied
by the passion for joy."2 In this way one comprehends the truth of origination
through the application of the mindfulness of sensation.
[4] Mind is the foundation for the notional attachment to the self. Since
there is no other self that is distinguished by the quality of permanence etc., the objec-
tive support for the notional attachment to the self is mind alone. Therefore, through
the investigation of this, one comprehends the truth of cessation, i.e. as
tranquillity. Here now he provides the reason: due to the removal of the fear of
self-annihilation. For the notional attachment to the self is checked by investigat-
ing impermanence etc. in regard to mind, and its perception as suffering arises. Hence,
due to the removal of the fear of self-annihilation, one comprehends the truth of cessa-
tion as tranquillity 27 because it is [equivalent to] the annihilation of suffering alone. In
this way one comprehends the truth of cessation through the application of the mind-
fulness of mind 28.
[5] Through the investigation of the dharmas, one comprehends the
truth of the path due to the absence of confusion concerning the

dharmas pertinent to defilement and purification. Therein, the dharmas that
pertain to defilement are the moral defilements and the secondary defilements; but those
that pertain to purification, i.e. love and friendliness etc., are the counteragents to the
moral defilements and secondary defilements 29. Having become aware of the nature of
the [respective] adverse elements and counteragents to those [dharmas] that pertain to
defilement and purification, one comes face to face with the expedient for the absolute
relinquishment of all distress, i.e. the truth of the path. In this way one comprehends
the truth of the path through the application of the mindfulness of the dharmas.
[6] "Comprehension" in the above refers to the understanding of the characteristic of
truth in regard to each of the [four] truths. Therein, the meditative development of the
applications of mindfulness of the body refers to [its understanding] as: (a) imperma-
nent, painful, empty and insubstantial, (b) having many impure substances for its own-
(c) the 'seed' of the impure, (d) the outflow of the ure, (e) the cause of
continued existence of impurity, (f) a modification into impurity, (g) the absence of
essence, like a mass of foam, (h) a state of existence and (i) a place of birth. Further-
more, the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness of sensation, mind
and the dharmas refers to [their understanding] as: (a) impermanent, painful, empty and
insubstantial, (b) an individual characteristic, (c) a universal characteristic³0, (d) a
cause, (e) a result, (f) a realm of existence, spiritual level and state of existence, (g)
wholesome, unwholesome and undefined and (h) adverse elements and counteragents.
For the bodhisattvas however, the meditative development of the applications of mind-
fulness for the purpose of the relinquishment of conceptual differentiation is both in
this way [as described] and is also in the aspect of non-perception. Although the
applications of mindfulness have wisdom for their own-being, the term "applications
of mindfulness" is so-called because [the wisdom elements] are applied by the force of
mindfulness, or, mindfulness is applied by means of these [wisdom elements ] ³1.

b. The Four Correct Exertions³2
When there is clear comprehension of the adverse elements and their
counteragents, in all modes, through the meditative development of the
applications of mindfulness a fourfold vigour arises for : (a) the
removal of the adverse elements and (b) the production of their counter-
agents. In detail, these are for the relinquishment of the evil unwhole-
some dharmas that have already arisen.
Y170.18 [1] Immediately following the meditative development of the applications of mindful-
ness, the meditative development of the correct exertions is described. As
to why, he says: because...

meditative development of the application of the mindfulness of the dharmas. When
there is clear comprehension of the adverse elements and their counter-
agents, in all modes 34; i.e. [in modes such as] the relinquishment of the realms of
existence and spiritual levels and in aspects of the universal characteristic etc., and also,
according to their differentiation as: impure, without impurity, realm of existence,
spiritual level, one still in training and the adept etc.35 For: (a) the removal of the

The interchangeability of the two terms samyakprahāṇa and samyakpradhana is noted in BHSD

here because it is essentially their vigorous and effortful nature that brought out in this
context.

adverse elements; the removal of adverse elements³6 here signifies the breaking of
the continuity of those that have already arisen and the non-generation of those that
have not yet arisen. And (b) the production of their counteragents³7; the pro-
duction of their counteragents is [equivalent to] the continuing supply of those that
have already arisen and the generation of those that have not yet arisen. A fourfold
vigour³8 arises39, i.e. a fourfold vigour arises according to its differentiation as an
adverse element or counteragent, which has already arisen or has not yet arisen. In
detail, these are for the relinquishment of the evil, unwholesome
dharmas that have already arisen. By this he shows the fourfold arising of
vigour in accordance with scriptural tradition. The term "in detail" refers to additional
text; this is the additional text: For the relinquishment [of evil unwholesome elements
that have already arisen]40 one generates will-power, makes endeavour, undertakes
with vigour, 'seizes' the mind and strives with correct effort. Thus, in detail: one
generates will-power for the non-production of the evil, unwholesome dharmas that
have not yet arisen. Similarly, in detail: one generates will-power for the production of
the wholesome dharmas that have not yet arisen. For the maintenance, increase, [non-
deprivation]41 and completion of the wholesome dharmas that have already arisen, one
generates will-power, makes endeavour, undertakes with vigour, 'seizes' the mind and
strives with correct effort. The maintenance of those that have arisen refers to their
non-decrease42. Increase is [equivalent to] continuous production; completion is
[equivalent to] culmination. By the rds: "one generates will-power", he shows that
it is an earnest application of the meditative development of vigour43. By "one makes
endeavour" is meant: one focuses on the body and mind for the relinquishment of lazi-
ness44. "One undertakes with vigour", in order to dispel both indolence and excitabil-
ity. How does one undertake? By 'seizing' the sluggish mind through the mental
attentions directed towards the dharmas that are both perceptible 45 and agreeable.

c. The Four Bases of Psychic Power.
The pliability of the stability of mind in the context of that medita-
tive development of the vigour for the removal and production of those
[dharmas] 49 consists in the four bases of psychic power because they
are the causes of mental power in all subjects, Stability, which refers
to the stability of mind here, should be known as meditative concentra-
tion. Hence, the bases of psychic power follow immediately after the
correct exertions. Furthermore, this pliability is to be known as
following from the meditative development of the eight formative forces
that facilitate relinquishment leading to the relinquishment of the five
faults.

production of adverse elements and their counteragents51; pliability 52 is [equivalent
to] the capacity for mental power in all subjects and this pliability comes about under
the influence of will-power, vigour, mind and examination. Hence he says: pliability
consists in the four bases of psychic power. Psychic power is [equivalent to]
mental power in all subjects such as the higher knowledges. These are the bases of
psychic power in the sense that they are the support for it - what is meant is: the bases
of psychic power are the causes of psychic power53. Hence he says: because they
are the causes of mental power. Moreover, they are: (a) the base of psychic
power associated with the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which
consists in the meditative concentration of will-power. (b) The base of psychic power
associated with the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in
the meditative concentration of vigour. (c) The base of psychic power associated with
the formative force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in the meditative
concentration of mind. (d) The base of psychic power associated with the formative
force that facilitates relinquishment and which consists in the meditative concentration
of examination. Of these, (a) the meditative concentration of will-power occurs when
one attains single-pointedness of mind while earnestly engaging in the meditative
development of vigour under the influence of will-power. (b) The meditative concen-
tration of vigour occurs when one attains single-pointedness of mind while undertak-
ing with vigour due to continual application. (c) The meditative concentration of mind
occurs when one attains single-pointedness of mind while holding the mind on mind
alone owing to the 'seed' of previous meditative concentration. (d) The meditative con-
centration of examination occurs when one who has thoroughly analysed the objective
support attains single-pointedness of mind. Stability, which refers to the
stability of mind here, should be known as meditative concentration; the
reference to meditative concentration is for the purpose of distinguishing this from
those [states] characterized by the conditioned elements. The pliability of mind 54
pertinent to one who has undertaken with vigour consists in the four bases of psychic
power; hence 55, the bases of psychic power are explained immediately.

The Five Faults.
Which are the five faults?
He says:
Laziness, (b) the forgetting of
instructions, (c) indolence and
excitability 59, (d) the absence of for-
mative influence and (e) formative
influence these are considered as
the five faults.
IV.4 abcd
In the above, indolence and excitability are made one fault. The
absence of formative influence is a fault at the time of the tranquilliza-
tion of indolence and excitability. Formative influence [is a fault] at
[the time of] tranquillity.
(a)
[Sthiramati]
Y173.11 [1] Since these five faults are not known, he asks: which are the five faults 260 In
order to demonstrate them he says:
IV.4 ab
49856
(a) Laziness, (b) the forgetting of
instructions, (c) indolence and
excitability 61 etc.
Since these faults number six, he says: in the above, indolence and excitability
are made one fault thus there are five. Of these, laziness is a fault at the time of
application because the absence of application is on account of it. The forgetting of
instructions is a fault on the part of one who has undertaken [to act] because the
absence of the concentration of mind is on account of it. Indolence / excitability is a
fault on the part of one whose mind is concentrated because the absence of pliability of
mind is on account of this. The absence of formative influence is a fault at

58 The Tib. for this final section (Y173.7-9) is slightly different: "...what is its cause? Hence he
says: ..is to be known as following from the cause which is the meditative
development of the formative forces for the relinquishment of the five faults

the time 62 of [the tranquillization of]63 indolence and excitability; the
absence of formative influence is [equivalent to] indifference because the absence of
the tranquillization of these two is on account of that. Formative influence [is a
fault] at [the time of] tranquillity; [the word] "fault" remains in force. Forma-
tive influence consists in volition, for it is said that tranquillity is due to the attainment
of 'sameness' (samatā) which is because of the removal of indolence and excitability.
The Eight Formative Forces that Facilitate Relinquishment.
How are the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment
respectively determined for the relinquishment of those [faults]? Four
are for the relinquishment of laziness, namely: (a) will-power, (b)
effort, (c) faith and (d) quiescence. Moreover, these should be known
sequentially as:
IV.5 ab
(a) Will-power is the basis of effort. (b) Effort is that which is
based [on will-power]. (c) Faith is the cause of that basis, i.e. will-
power, because there is an eagerness in one who has firm belief. (d)
Quiescence is the result of that which is based [on will-power], i.e.
effort, because one who undertakes with vigour attains a special medi-
tative concentration.
(a) The basis, (b) that which is based
on it, (c) the cause of the former and
(d) the result;
There are four remaining formative forces that facilitate relinquish-
ment, namely, (a) mindfulness, (b) full awareness, (c) volition and (d)
equanimity which are the counteragents to the [other] four faults as
enumerated. Furthermore, they should be known sequentially, begin-
ning with mindfulness:
62
63
64
IV.S cdef
(a) the non-loss64 of the objective
support, (b) the understanding of
indolence and excitability, (c) the
formative influence for the removal
of the latter and (d) the employment
of meditative calm when appease-
ment occurs.

(a) Mindfulness is the non-loss of the objective support. (b) Full
awareness is the understanding of indolence and excitability when there
is no loss of mindfulness. (c) Volition is the formative influence for
the removal of the latter [two] after they have been understood. (d) The
employment of meditative calm refers to the equanimity of mind that
occurs when that indolence and excitability are appeased.
[Sthiramati]
Y174.4 [1] [The term]: 'formative forces that facilitate relinquishment' (prahäṇa-samskäräḥ)65
is [resolved as]: 'formative forces that lead to relinquishment (prahāṇāya samskäräh)
[i.e. as a tatpuruşa compound]. They are for the relinquishment of what? For the
relinquishment of the five faults that have just been described. If so, then this should
be stated: How are the eight formative forces that facilitate relinquishment
respectively determined for the relinquishment of those66 [faults]? Of
these, four are for the relinquishment of laziness, namely: (a) will-
power, (b) effort, (c) faith and (d) quiescence. Will-power therein is
[equivalent to] eagerness; effort is [equivalent to] vigour; faith is [equivalent to] firm
belief; and quiescence is [equivalent to] pliability. Just how are they respectively
determined as leading to the relinquishment of laziness? Hence he says: moreover,
these should be known sequentially as:
IV.5 ab
(a) The basis, (b) that which is based
on it, (c) the cause of the former and
(d) the result;
Hence he shows that they are conducive to the relinquishment of laziness because they
arise 67 one from the other. (a) Will-power is the basis of effort. (b) Effort
is that which is based [on will-power], because eagerness is preceded by
effort. (c) Faith is the cause of that basis68, i.e. will-power... How so? He
says: ...because there is an eagerness in one who has firm belief, for, one
who possesses faith in regard to the cause and result is eager to act. Quiescence is
the result of that which is based [on will-power], i.e. effort. How so?
He says: ...because one who undertakes with vigour attains a special
meditative concentration; for the attainment of a special meditative concentration
is the cause of quiescence. Hence quiescence is described as the result of effort
because one who undertakes with vigour attains a special meditative concentration.

For thus, joy arises in one who has undertaken with vigour due to the absence of the
fault of conceptual differentiation that consists in disquiet69. The quiescence of body
and mind that results from a joyous mind has the characteristic70 of pliability; conse-
quently, it is described as: "the attainment of a special meditative concentration".
Moreover, in this context, it is vigour together with its cause and result that is
described as the counteragent71 to laziness.
[2] [The remaining four formative forces that facilitate relinquishment,
namely: (a) mindfulness, (b) full awareness, (c) volition and (d) equa-
nimity are the counteragents to the [other] four faults as enumerated.
Of these, mindfulness is the counteragent to the forgetting of instructions. Full aware-
ness is [the counteragent] to indolence and excitability. Volition is [the counteragent}
to the absence of formative influence. Equanimity is [the counteragent] to formative
influence; in this context it is the equanimity that consists in the formative forces that is
to be understood. Moreover, since he wishes to discuss the characteristic of mindful-
ness etc. here, he says: furthermore, they should be known sequentially,
beginning with mindfulness. [mindfulness refers to:]
IV.5 c
(a) non-loss of an objective support
etc.
(a) Mindfulness is the non-loss of an objective support; what is meant is:
the expression of the content of an instruction conducive to the stability of mind 72.
Full awareness is the understanding of indolence and excitability when
there is no loss of mindfulness, for, one for whom mindfulness is present
possesses full awareness; this why he says: "when there is no loss of mindfulness".
After they are understood, i.e. indolence and excitability; what is meant is: [full
awareness] arises effortlessly due to the coupling of the two, i.e. meditative calm and
penetrating insight. By "equanimity" is meant: the absence of formative influence in
regard to other objects. This is what is being said: one for whom mindfulness is
present understands the sluggish or excited mind, as it is in reality, when instruction [is
given]; and in order to be rid of indolence and excitability he formatively influences
that [mind]. Also, due to the disappearance of both indolence and excitability, equa-
nimity is created. Thus the meditative calm that belongs to the mind of such a person

d. The Five Faculties.
The five faculties beginning with faith [were listed] immediately
after the bases of psychic power. How are they respectively estab-
lished?
IV.6 abcd
When the elements that are con-
ducive to liberation are fostered, it is
due to the influence of: (a) will-
power, (b) application, (c) non-loss74
of the objective support, (d) non-dif-
fusion and (e) analysis.
The words: "from the influence of" remain in force [in each case].
When the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation has
been fostered by the bases of psychic power in one who has mental
pliability, it is due to: (a) the influence of will-power, (b) the influence
of application, (c) the influence of the non-loss of the objective
support, (d) the influence of non-diffusion and (e) the influence of
thorough analysis. The five faculties beginning with faith should be
known in sequential order.
[Sthiramati]
[1] It is the fact that the five faculties beginning with faith were described
immediately after the bases of psychic power that is referred to. How are
they respectively established? The intended meaning is: in what sense [are they
respectively established]? Hence he says:

power, (b) application etc.

236
The words: "due to the influence of 75 remain in force [in each case]; by
this statement he shows that the term "influence" employed here, i.e. in the phrase "it is
due to the influence of: (a) will-power, (b) application...", remains in force for each
subsequent [faculty] as well. When the root of the wholesome which is con-
ducive to liberation has been fostered76 by the bases of psychic power in
one who has mental pliability...; the root of the wholesome which is conducive
to liberation finds a support in the mental continuum 77 of one who has mental pliability.
...It is due to: (a) the influence of will-power etc., concluding with (e) the
influence of thorough analysis; but not in one who does not have mental pliabil-
ity. Moreover, this mental pliability comes about through the bases of psychic power.
Therefore, immediately after the bases of psychic power, the five faculties beginning
with faith are respectively determined as being due to the influence of the fostering of
the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation. It is actually faith that is
referred to by the term "will-power" in the statement: "...from the influence of will-
power", for, the effect is expressed figuratively here in regard to the cause [i.e. will-
power is the cause of faith]. Just as, for example, [the eating of] yoghurt and melon
[which is the cause] is [figuratively described as] a sudden fever. Alternatively, belief,
serene faith, and eagerness respecively with regard to existence, the possession of
virtue 78 and ability are the characteristics of faith. Hence, through the reference to will-
power79 in this context, it is actually faith as characterized by eagerness that is referred
to and not will-power. (b) The influence of application; it is application
(prayoga) since one applies oneself (prayujyate) by means of this. By the word
'application', it is vigour that is intended. (c) The influence of the non-loss 80 of
the objective support; i.e. due to the influence of the faculty of mindfulness. The
faculty of mindfulness is characterized by the distinct expression of the objective
support81. (d) The influence of non-diffusion; i.e. due to the influence of the
faculty of meditative concentration, for, non-diffusion consists in the faculty of medita-
tive concentration because this is characterized by single-pointedness of mind. And
(e) the influence of thorough analysis; i.e. due to the influence of the faculty of
wisdom because the faculty of wisdom has the nature of the thorough analysis of the
dharmas. The word "and" shows that the five faculties beginning with faith82
should be known in sequential order because they are the influences in the

fostering of the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation83. One who
has faith undertakes with vigour in order to escape from the prison of samsăra, and,
since one who has undertaken with vigour84 accomplishes the three teachings, the
faculties of mindfulness, meditative concentration and wisdom follow in sequential
order. Thus, at the level of application on the path of vision, the faculties are consid-
ered to be of central importance.
[2] However, others believe that faith etc. are not faculties because they influence the
nourishment of the root of the wholesome which is conducive to liberation. Rather,
they are described as faculties because when the root of the wholesome which is con-
ducive to liberation is nourished, faith etc. exercise influence. It is in order to demon-
strate just this that he says: "due to the influence of will-power", faith is a faculty; the
latter is to be supplied. Application is [equivalent to] performance. Not forgetting [or
non-loss; asammoșa; asampramoșa] is [equivalent to the non-disappearance of the
objective support. Non-diffusion is [equivalent to] non-dispersion. Analysis 85 is
[equivalent to] thorough analysis. The mental concomitants called vigour, mindful-
ness, meditative concentration and wisdom are termed faculties because of their influ-
ence over application, non-forgetfullness, non-diffusion and thorough analysis. How-
ever, the following should be stated in this regard: when the root of the wholesome
which is conducive to liberation has been nourished there is no difference in own-
being, in comparison with the unnourised state86, between the influence of will-power
etc. and faith etc.87 because at that time they are established as faculties due to their
influence over it [i.e. the root of the wholesome].
These same [elements], i.e. faith etc., are described as the powers
when they possess power.
Moreover, their possession of power is:

When they are not intermixed with adverse elements such as lack of
faith. Why is there an initial and subsequent explanation of faith etc.?
Because:
Y178
the latter is the result of the former;
For, one who possesses faith undertakes with vigour in regard to
cause and result. Mindfulness is present for one who has undertaken
with vigour; the mind of one for whom mindfulness is present becomes
concentrated; one whose mind is concentrated understands [phenomena]
as they are in reality. The faculties that pertain to the elements which
are conducive to liberation, and which have been nourished, have now
been described.
IV.7 b
Now, should the elements that are conducive to penetration be
known as being in the state of a 'faculty' or in the state of a 'power'?
IV.7 cd
The elements conducive to penetra-
tion are in twos, i.e. both faculties
and powers.
The [state of] heat and the summit are faculties; the receptivities and
highest mundane realizations are powers.
[Sthiramati]
Y177.22 [1] These same [elements], i.e. faith etc., which are discussed immediately
after the faculties, are described as the powers when they possess power.
Moreover, their possession of power is due to what? Hence he says:
IV.7 a
Due to the curbing of adverse ele-
ments;
Because the adverse elements are curbed. In order to demonstrate just this, he says:
when these faculties such as faith are not intermixed with adverse elements
such as lack of faith, i.e. with lack of faith88, laziness, forgetfulness, distraction89
and lack of full awareness which are adverse to faith etc.; what is meant is: they do not
intermingle [with adverse elements] because, being extremely attenuated they do not
manifest time and again at that time they are described as 'powers'. These faculties are
intermixed with adverse elements at that time because the elements that are adverse to
them have not been erased.
[2] If the faculties are possessed of adverse elements that have not been subdued, how
then, can faith etc. be described as 'faculties' by way of the influence of mundane purity
in [Chapter III. 10 titled] 'The Reality of the Skills'? Because in that section the faculties

239
are intended as being without differentiation but here they are differentiated in order to
demonstrate the differentiation of the root of the wholesome which is conducive to
penetration therefore there is no contradiction. Only hence does he say: "these same
faculties...are described as 'powers".
[3] For, one who possesses faith undertakes with vigour in regard to
the cause and result90; i.e. he connects the cause with its respective result and vice
versa. Thus, because of his faith in the result, one who possesses faith undertakes
with vigour in regard to the cause. Mindfulness is present for one who has
undertaken with vigour because it depends upon the latter91. The mind of one
for whom mindfulness is present becomes concentrated, i.e. it becomes
single-pointed because there is no distraction. One whose mind is concentrated
understands [phenomena] as they are in reality; i.e. the wisdom that is
assisted by meditative concentration becomes pure. The faculties that pertain to
the elements which are conducive to liberation, and which have been
nourished 92, have now been described.
[4] The elements which are conducive to penetration follow immediately after the
elements which are conducive to liberation and the powers follow immediately after the
faculties, hence this should be stated: should the elements conducive to pene-
tration be known as being in the state of a 'faculty' or in the state of a
'power¹937 Similarly, do the essential natures of the faculties and the powers consist
in the elements that are conducive to penetration, or are their essential natures separate
from them? Hence, [answering] all of these [questions] he says:
IV.7 cd
The elements conducive to penetra-
tion are in twos: both faculties and
powers.
Alternatively, in the same way that the elements that are conducive to liberation are
characterized by the meditative development of the counteragent, or are characterized
by faith etc., so too are the elements that are conducive to penetration; consequently, he
says: "the faculties that pertain to the elements which are conducive to liberation, and
which have been nourished 94, have now been described etc." Hence he then says: "the
elements conducive to penetration are in twos".

[5] The [states of] heat 95 and the summit are faculties; they are definitely
faculties because these [roots of the 196 wholesome are feeble since it is untenable 97 that
there are powers 98 among them. The receptivities and highest mundane real-
izations are powers. The receptivities and highest mundane realizations are
definitely powers for it is impossible that these can be faculties because of their
strength. Moreover, faith etc. are threefold according to their differentiation as weak,
middling and strong. The weak and middling of these are the faculties and the strong
are the powers. Those that are weak are the [states of] heat; the middling are the
summits. However the strong therein are divided into four: the weak, the middling and
the strong are, respectively, the weak, middling and strong receptivities; while the
strongest of the strong are the highest mundane realizations. Moreover, all99 of these
elements that are conducive to penetration 100, together with their associated elements,
have meditative concentration and wisdom for their essential nature; the aspect of heat
in the latter is the [state of] heat. For example, from the rubbing together of kindling
sticks, heat is produced which is the first mark of the arising (utpatti-cihna) of the fire
which has the capacity to burn that [fuel]. Similarly, the [state of] heat is so-called101
because its nature precedes the 'fire' of the noble path which has the capacity to
consume the 'fuel' of all moral defilement. The summit [is so-called] since it extends
up until the summit away from fickle roots of the wholesome. The receptivities [are
so-called] because they consist in perseverance in the meaning of the [four] truths. The
highest mundane realizations are so-called because they are accompanied by impurity
and also because they are foremost among the other impure dharmas. Their pre-
eminence is due to the fact that the origination of the path of vision occurs immediately
after [the realization of them. Moreover, they are momentary, [whereas] the other
elements that are conducive to penetration are continuous. In the above, the root of the
wholesome [the realization of] which is conducive to liberation, should be known as
the yoga that destroys the power that causes samsāra to come into being. [The realiza-
tion of those conducive to penetration [should be known] as the yoga that generates
the power for the arising of dharmas that are not accompanied by impurity.

N53.13 The limbs of enlightenment follow immediately after the powers.
How are they established?
IV.8 abcd
(a) The limb of the basis, (b) the
limb of own-being, (c) the limb of
setting forth is the third, (d) the limb
of advantage is the fourth and (e) the
limb of the absence of defilement is
considered as threefold.
241
The limbs of enlightenment refer to the limbs that lead to enlighten-
ment on the path of vision. Of these, (a) the limb of the basis of
enlightenment refers to mindfulness. (b) The limb of own-being refers
to the analysis of the dharmas. (c) The limb of setting forth refers to
vigour. (d) The limb of advantage refers to delight. (e) The limb of the
absence of defilement which is threefold refers to: quiescence, medita-
tive concentration and equanimity. But why is the limb of the absence
of defilement taught as threefold?
IV.9 ab
It is taught by way of: (a) the
underlying cause, (b) the basis and
(c) the own-being;
102
(a) The underlying cause of the absence of defilement refers to
quiescence because defilement is caused by disquiet and [quiescence] is
the counteragent to the latter. (b) The basis refers to meditative
concentration. (c) The own-being refers to equanimity.
[Sthiramati]
Y180.10 [1] Since the path of vision arises immediately after the highest [mundane] realizations
and because it is characterized by the limbs of enlightenment, he says: the limbs of
enlightenment follow immediately after the powers. How are they
established 102? The intended meaning is: for what purpose are they established?
Hence he says:
IV.8 a
(a) The limb of the basis, (b) the
limb of own-being etc.
The limbs of enlightenment refer the limbs that lead to enlightenment
on the path of vision. It is [described as] vision (darśana) since [the aspirant] has
Read: teşam katham vyavasthanam in place of katham etäni vyavasthapyanta; cf. Bhaşya
N53.13.Y181
242
the perception, for the very first time, of a reality that was previously unseen; and since
it causes the attainment of the noble spiritual levels it is the path (märga); hence it is
described as the path of vision (darśana-marga). For, in the state of [the realization of]
the elements that are conducive to penetration 103, the [four] truths are perceived as
though concealed by a ine silken cloth; [whereas] in the state of the path of vision, it is
as though that [cloth] has been removed. In the above, enlightenment104, which refers
to the perfect comprehension of reality, consists in the direct intuition that is free from
conceptual differentiation. With regard to that, the six beginning with mindfulness are
[described as] its limbs because they are in conformity with enlightenment. However,
the analysis of the dharmas is (equivalent to] enlightenment because it has the nature of
understanding 105 and it is a 'limb' because it is a 'companion' to the others 106. Another
[school] believes that the analysis of the dharmas, which is included in the path that
brings an immediate result (änantarya-märga), is [only] a limb of enlightenment but
that [analysis] which is included in the path of liberation (vimukti-mārga) [equivalent
to] enlightenment.
[2] Of these, (a) the limb of the basis of enlightenment107 refers to
mindfulness; because the absence of distraction in regard to an objective support is
through the force of mindfulness. (b) The limb of own-being refers to the
analysis of the dharmas; because enlightenment has direct intuition for its own-
being 108
(c) The limb of setting forth refers to vigour; because the level of
ordinary people is completely transcended through vigour. (d) The limb of
advantage refers to delight; because the benefits to body and mind¹09 are on
account of this. (e) The limb of the absence of defilement which is three-
fold refers to: quiescence, meditative concentration and equanimity
because these are counteragents to defilement. Alternatively, it is because they are
differentiated as the underlying cause, the basis and the own-being of the absence of
defilement.
[3] But why is the limb of the absence of defilement taught as three-
fold? The intended meaning is: in what sense is it taught as threefold? Hence he
says:

Ms.(56b.1): kayacitta-; disregard Y's fn.3 p.181.Y182
It is taught by way of: (a) the
underlying cause, (b) the basis and
(c) the own-being;
(a) The underlying cause of the absence of defilement refers to quies-
cenceli0; the absence of defilement is [equivalent to] cation. The underlying
cause (nidäna) is [equivalent to] the cause [kāraṇa]. As to why it is the underlying
cause, he says: because defilement is caused by disquiet and because
[quiescence] is the counteragent to the latter. This is what is being said:
[quiescence] is the underlying cause of the absence of defilement because it is the
counteragent to the underlying cause of defilement. Disquiet consists in physical and
mental inefficiency; when this exists, mind becomes distracted because single-pointed-
ness of the mind is impossible. Moreover, defilement, such as passion, arises in one
whose mind is distracted; thus, disquiet is the cause of defilement. The counteragent to
that disquiet is quiescence. How so? Because quiescence brings about physical and
mental efficiency¹12. In this way quiescence is determined to be the underlying cause
of the absence of defilement. (b) The basis refers to meditative concentra-
tion. The mind is concentrated in one whose body and mind are assisted by quies-
cence; when the mind becomes concentrated, one understands [phenomena] as they are
in reality and moral defilement is relinquished because one sees them as they are in
reality. Thus, the basis of the absence of defilement is meditative concentration. (c)
The own-being refers to equanimity because this is the counteragent to: (a)
mind's unevenness, (b) mind's absence of meditative calm and (c) mind's state of
effort 13, all of which are conformable to the defiled condition. Thus, the own-being of
the absence of defilement is equanimity.
[4] However, others believe that when defilement which is to be relinquished through
vision has been relinquished by means of the paths of relinquishment114, wisdom is
generated ¹15 that is free from the encumbrances of that defilement, is pure in its own-
being, is incorporated in the path of liberation¹16 and is positively determined in regard
to the knowable. That wisdom is described as equanimity in this context since one
shows equanimity in thinking: "there is extinction in regard to extinction", because
what is to be done has been done.

elements;
On the path of meditative development, the limb for the accurate
determination of the path of vision117 is mundane correct view which is
obtained subsequently to the supramundane by means of this, one
accurately determines one's own understanding. The limbs for the
attainment of others are correct intention and correct speech because
their attainment is on account of speech together with that which causes
its arising. The limbs for the confidence of others are threefold: correct
speech, correct action and correct livelihood, for, by means of these

For the adverse elements are threefold: (a) the moral defilement to be
abandoned by meditative development, (b) the secondary defilements of
indolence and excitability and (c) that which is adverse to supremacy
and is an obstruction to the achievement of the special qualities. Here,
correct effort is the counteragent to the first, since the meditative devel-
opment of the path is on account of that. Correct mindfulness [is the
counteragent] to the second, because one who has properly applied
mindfulness in regard to the causal-signs of tranquillization etc., is free
from indolence and excitability. Correct meditative concentration [is
the counteragent] to the third because one achieves the qualities such as
the higher knowledges with the meditative absorptions for a basis.
[Sthiramati]
[1] The limbs of the path follow immediately after the limbs of enlight-
enment. How are they respectively established? The path of meditative
development follows immediately after the path of vision and since the limbs of the
path are included therein, the limbs of the path are described immediately following the
limbs of enlightenment. In what sense are they respectively established? Hence he
says:
IV.9 c
...(a) Accurate determination, (b) the
causing of attainment¹19 etc.
The eight limbs of the path¹20, beginning with correct view, are respectively established
as being adverse to [the eight beginning with] false view and concluding with false
meditative concentration. Their sequential order is in accordance with their order of
efficacy 121; in detail, they consist in the path of meditative development. It is the path
of meditative development (bhāvanā-märga) since it is cultivated (bhavyate) through
the frequent exercise of meditative development (niṣevaṇa-bhāvanā).
[2] On that path of meditative development, the limb for the accurate
determination of the path of vision which is cultivated through meditative
development that has been attained is mundane correct view; it is mundane since it
is accompanied by conceptual differentiation. It is determined [as such] even for one
who has entered the path because such a person has acquired the capacity for its

arising; however, the supramundane is devoid of conceptual differentiation 122.
Although devoid of conceptual differentiation123, it is described as correct view since it
is the basis of correct view; hence he says: ...which is obtained subsequently to
the supramundane. What is meant is: [correct view] is obtained, i.e. has arisen,
subsequently, i.e. through the force of 24, the supramundane path of vision. But what
is its object? Hence he says: ...by means of this, one accurately determines
one's own understanding, i.e. one's understanding of the path of vision insofar as
one thinks: "I understand thus". It is described as correct view because it has the path
of vision for its object.
[3] The limbs for the attainment of others; in detail: the limbs for the attain-
ment of others ...are correct intention and correct speech because, by means of
correct speech and correct intention, others attain [the realization of] a reality that has
been accurately determined through correct view. Hence he says: because their
attainment is on account of speech together with that which causes its
arising; for, correct intention causes the arising of [correct] speech because of this
statement from a Sutra: "one does not utter a word without having conjectured and
deliberated", 125 Moreover, one who is concentrated should be known as being
endowed with these two [qualities] because he acquires the capacity to produce them;
however, one who is concentrated neither speculates nor speaks.
[4] The limbs for the confidence of others are threefold: correct speech,
correct action and correct livelihood. How so? He says: for, by means of
these, i.e. by means of correct speech126, action and livelihood, respectively:
IV.10 cd
It is considered that another is
informed 127 in regard to vision,
morality and austerity.
On account of correct speech etc. Discussion refers to the teachings of the
Dharma; certainty concerning doctrinal disputation refers to the formulation of
objections and refutations in regard to spiritual realization, together with others. One
has confidence in wisdom on account of that discussion and certainty
concerning doctrinal disputation; i.e. due to the injunction of others 128 a reality
is understood on account of those [i.e. discussion etc.] inasmuch as one thinks: "this

statement has meaning which is unimpaired 129, thoroughly ascertained, without contra-
diction and is crystal clear". [One has confidence] in morality on account of
correct action; [the words]: "one has confidence" remain in force. Why [does one
have confidence in morality...]? He says: because one does not perform action
that should not be performed. Correct action is contrary to evil conduct; hence,
one who is endowed with 30 this does not perform action that should not be per-
formed, even for the sake of his life. Consequently, since such a person possesses
morality that is pleasing to the Noble Ones, one has confidence in him. [One has
confidence] in austerity on account of correct livelihood; [the words]: "one
has confidence" are understood. Why [does one have confidence in austerity...]? He
says: because of the Dharma and also because one's desire for garments
131 is in moderation. Correct livelihood refers to the normal behaviour of body
and speech which is devoid of the faults of hypocrisy etc. for the sake of the necessi-
ties of life. On account of this, one has confidence in austerity and one's cravings for
the necessities of life certainly relinquished because such a person desires garments
etc. according to propriety and in moderation just for the sake of the continued exis-
tence of the basis [i.e. the physical body]132. In this regard, one has no pride on
account of correct view because of clear comprehension of one's own understanding
[of phenomena] as it is in reality. One speaks with the roar of a lion through the
speech which is caused to arisel33 by way of correct intention. By means of correct
speech 134, action and livelihood, one manifests one's individual status [i.e. as a śramaṇa
or brahmacări etc.].
etc.
[5] The limb that is the counteragent to adverse elements is threefold¹35
and since these are not known, he says: correct effort, correct mindfulness and
correct meditative concentration. As to which adverse elements these are the
counteragents, he says: for these 136 are, respectively:

248
Here, correct effort [is the counteragent] to the first. For, moral defilement
that is to be relinquished by means of meditative development is the first adverse
element; correct effort is the counteragent to that. How so? He says: since the
meditative development of the path is on account of that, i.e. is on account
of correct effort. Correct effort is [equivalent to] vigour which is taken possession of
by correct view and remains in meditative concentration free from indolence and
excitability¹37. By means of this, with the aim of relinquishing the moral defilements
which are to be relinquished through meditative development, one cultivates the path as
the counteragent to them; thus, correct effort is described as the counteragent to the first
because it causes the accomplishment of correct meditative concentration. In the
context of that same meditative development of the path, correct mindfulness [is
the counteragent] to the second, i.e. secondary defilement which is characterized
by indolence and excitability; [the term] "counteragent" needs to be supplied. Why [is
correct mindfulness the counteragent]? He says: because one who has properly
applied mindfulness in regard to the causal-signs of tranquillization etc.
is free from indolence and excitability 138; by the word "etc."139 the causal-
sign of exertion and the causal-sign of equanimity are also to be understood. Tranquil-
lization in this regard is due to the appeasement of the causal-sign of distraction. The
causal-sign (nimitta) of tranquillization etc. is [equivalent to] the cause (kärapa) of
tranquillization etc. With regard to this, when mind is excited or is suspected of
becoming excited, mental attention directed towards an entity that is apt to cause a
'shuddering'! 140 is the causal-sign of tranquillization. When mind is sluggish or is
suspected of becoming lethargic, mental attention directed towards an entity that is apt
to cause delight is the causal-sign of exertion. When the path is devoted exclusively to
tranquillity or is devoted exclusively to insight¹41, or when it combines both of these,
the impassive mental attention directed towards that which is defiled¹42 by the former
two secondary defilements is the causal-sign of equanimity. That which is adverse to
supremacy 143 which consists in the qualities such as the higher knowledges is unde-
filed nescience144 which consists in the obscuration to the attainments. Correct
meditative concentration [is the counteragent] to the third; [the word]
"counteragent" is to be supplied. As to why [it is the counteragent to the third], he

says: because one achieves 145 the qualities such as the higher knowledges
with the meditative absorptions for a basis. For, meditative absorption is the
basis for the achievement of all the special qualities thus it is the counteragent to the
obscuration to the attainments 146, being adverse to the achievement of the qualities such
as the higher knowledges. Therefore, he has stated that: (a) dissociation from obscura-
tion that consists in moral defilement is by way of correct effort, (b) the complete
purification of meditative concentration is by way of correct mindfulness and (c)
separation from obscuration to the attainments 147 is by way of correct meditative
concentration.
h. The Differentiation 148 of the Meditative
Development of the Counteragent.
249
That meditative development of the counteragent should be known
summarily as threefold:
IV.11 cd & 12 ab
Meditative development as: (a) con-
formable but erroneously inverted,
(b) erroneous inversion accompanied
by connection and (c) not erro-
neously inverted and free from the
connection with erroneous inversion;
(a) Although erroneously inverted, it conforms with the absence of
erroneous inversion; (b) although not erroneously inverted, it is con-
nected with erroneous inversion; and (c) it is not erroneously inverted
and is free from connection with erroneous inversion. These relate
respectively to the state of: (i) ordinary people, (ii) those in training
and (iii) the adepts. However, for the bodhisattvas:
IV.12 cd
A distinction is made in terms of: (a)
objective support, (b) mental atten-
tion and (c) attainment.
For, the objective supports of the śrävakas and pratyekabuddhas are
the body etc. belonging to their own mental continuum. [The objective

supports] for the bodhisattvas are [those things] belonging to their own
mental continuum as well as that of others. The śrävakas and pratyeka-
buddhas are mentally attentive of their body etc. in the aspects of
impermanence etc. However, the bodhisattvas [are mentally attentive]
in the manner of non-perception. The śrävakas and pratye kabuddhas
cultivate the applications of mindfulness etc. only insofar as they lead
to the dissociation of the body etc. The bodhisattvas do not (cultivate
the latter] for the purpose of dissociation, nor for non-dissociation,
[they cultivate them] up until the [attainment of the] nirvana in which
they are not permanently fixed.
The meditative development of the counteragent has now been
described.
[Sthiramati]
185.21 [1] That meditative development of the counteragent should be known
summarily as threefold, according to its differentiation as: (a) an undertaking, (b)
something obtained and (c) completion; however, in detail it is of various kinds. How
so?
Y186
IV.11 c
[Meditative development as]: (a)
conformable but erroneously
inverted etc.
In this respect, (a) although erroneously inverted, it conforms with the
absence of erroneous inversion. The absence of erroneous inversion refers to
the path of vision because it has reality for its object and since it conforms with the
latter, it conforms with the absence of erroneous inversion. Moreover, this is the med-
itative development of ordinary people, thus, it is erroneously inverted because it
does not have reality for its object; i.e. because ordinary people have not relinquished
moral defilement in its entirety. How can it conform with the absence of erroneous
inversion when it is erroneously inverted? Because it has arisen¹49 from the latent
impressions of what is learnt which flows out of the extremely pure dharmadhātu.
And this begins with the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness
and concludes with the meditative development of the powers. (b) Although not
erroneously inverted, it is connected with erroneous inversion. This is
equivalent to the meditative development of the limbs of enlightenment and the medita-
tive development of the path, and is pertinent to those still in training. It is not
erroneously inverted because it has reality for its object and it is connected with erro-
neous inversion because of the presence of moral defilement which is to be relin-
quished through meditative development. (c) It is not erroneously inverted and
149 Read: utpannatvāt in place of utpannāt, Tib. byun ba'i phyir (D280a.3).Y187
251
is free from connection with erroneous inversion. This refers to the medita-
tive development of the path pertinent to the adepts, i.e. the arhats 150. It is not erro-
neously inverted because it has reality for its object; it is not connected with erroneous
inversion and is pertinent to the arhat because he has relinquished all stain.
[2] Now, in order to demonstrate the distinction between the meditative development
of the counteragent for the bodhisattvas in contrast to that of the śrāvakas etc., he says:
however, for the bodhisattvas:
IV.12 cd
A distinction is made in terms of: (a)
objective support, (b) mental atten-
tion and (c) attainment. 151
Therein, there is a distinction152 in terms of objective support, for, the objective
supports, i.e. the body, sensation, mind and the dharmas, of the śrävakas and
pratyekabuddhas are the body etc. with its own mental continuum.
However, the objective supports, i.e. the body, sensation, mind and the dharmas, for
the bodhisattvas are [those things] belonging to their own mental con-
tinuum as well as that of others. Why do they have different objective
supports? Because it is with reference to just their own benefit that the śråvakas etc.
engage in the meditative development of the counteragent; however, for the
bodhisattvas, it is with reference to both their own benefit and that of others. In the
aspects of impermanence etc.; i.e. in the aspects of the impermanent, the painful,
the empty and the insubstantial. Why is the mental attention of the śrävakas and
pratyekabuddhas [applied] thus in [the aspect of the impermanent etc.? In order to
generate aversion for the latter because one who is not averse does not dissociate from
them. The bodhisattvas [arementally attentive] in the manner of non-
perception; what is meant is: in the modes of the non-perception of the imaginary
nature. Why are they mentally attentive in this way? In order to relinquish all concep-
tual differentiation - this is said to be peculiar to them. Not only are they mentally atten-
tive in the manner of non-perception but also in the aspects of the impermanent etc.
Thus, a distinction is made because of the differences in their mental attention. Only
insofar as they lead to the dissociation of the body etc. The dissociation of
the body etc. refers to the nirvana without a remaining substratum and the relinquish-
ment of moral defilement which has it (i.e. the body) for its objective support. The
bodhisattvas do not [cultivate the latter] for the purpose of dissociation,
nor for non-dissociation. What is the reason? For, those who are absolutely
dissociated or not dissociated from the body etc. would not have the capacity to
150 Read: iyam arhatam aśaikşa- in place of iyam asaikşa-; Tib. 'di ni dgra bcom pa mi slob pa'i

provide benefit for sentient beings, just like those whose moral defilement has been
extinguished [i.e. who are absolutely dissociated] and ordinary beings [i.e. who are
absolutely non-dissociated]. If it leads neither to dissociation nor non-dissociation ¹53,
why then do they cultivate¹54 the counteragents? Hence he says: [they cultivate
them] on account of the fact that they lead to the attainment of the
nirväpa in which one is not permanently fixed 155. What is this nirvana [in
which the bodhisattva is] not permanently fixed? While [the aspirant] is in the
bodhisattva state since it is the basis for mastery over karma and rebirth - although he
is reborn in samsära on account of his compassion, he is without defilement there
owing to the strength of his wisdom. This is called 156 the unfixed nirvana of the the
bodhisattva. Although he is stationed in samsāra, he is not defiled like ordinary people
are, nor does he [attain] the nirvana devoid of substratum 157, like the śrävakas etc.
Moreover, in the tathāgata state he is not permanently fixed in samsåra because he has
relinquished the obscuration that consists in both moral defilement and the cognizable.
Nor is he permanently fixed in the nirvana devoid of a remaining substratum because
there is no interruption to the Dharma Body, for, as long as the world exists, he per-
forms benefit for others through the Enjoyment and Transformation Bodies. In this
way a distinction is made between the bodhisattva and the śrävaka etc. concerning the
meditative development of the counteragent according to differences in objective
support, mental attention and result. The meditative development of the
counteragent has now been described.

2. The State Therein.
Which are the states in regard to the latter?
IV.13 abcd
IV.14 abcd & 15 a
(a) The causal state, (b) that called
'arrival', those named: (c)
'preparatory' and (d) 'result', (e) that
with duties to be performed, (f)
without duties to be performed and
(g) that of excellence, (h) the super-
ior and (i) the unsurpassable.
[The states] are listed in relation to:
(a) firm conviction, (b) entry, (c) set-
ting forth, (d) prophecy, (e) teach-
ing, (f) consecration, (g) attainment,
(h) benefit and (i) performance of
duty.
253
Of these, (a) the causal state is that which pertains to an individual
stationed on a spiritual lineage. (b) The arrival state pertains to one
whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated. (c) The prepara-
tory state is subsequent to the generation of the resolve when the result
has not been attained. (d) The state of result [occurs when the latter]
has been attained. (e) The state with duties to be performed pertains to
one who is still in training. (f) The state without duties to be per-
formed pertains to the adept. (g) The state of excellence pertains to one
endowed with the special qualities of the higher knowledges etc. (h)
The superior state pertains to the bodhisattva who has entered the spiri-
tual levels above the śrävaka etc. (i) The unsurpassable state pertains
to the Buddha because there is no state that is superior to that.
(a) The state of firm conviction pertains to the bodhisattvas
on all
the spiritual levels consisting in the course of firm conviction.
(b) The
state of entry [pertains to those] on the first spiritual level.
(c) The
state of setting forth, on the six spiritual levels subsequent to the latter.
(d) The prophetic state, on the eighth spiritual level. (e) The state of
teacher, on the ninth. (f) The state of consecration, on the tenth. (g)
The attainment state refers to the Dharma Body of the Buddhas. (h)
The state of benefit refers to the Enjoyment Body. (i) The state of the
performance of duty refers to the Transformation Body.N57
Y188.2
Moreover, all of these various states, in short, should be known
Threefold in relation to the dharma-
dhätu: (a) impure, (b) impure and
pure and (c) purified, as is appro-
priate.
IV.15 bed
158
159
Of these, (a) the impure state is inclusive of the causal state, up until
the preparatory. (b) The state that is both impure and pure pertains to
those still in training. (c) The purified state pertains to the adepts.
IV.16 ab
254
Hence is the respective establishment
of individuals considered, as is
fitting;
as:
Hence, from the differentiation of their states, as is fitting, the
establishment of individuals should be known in this way: "this
[person] is stationed in a spiritual lineage; that [person] has arrived"
etc. The states have now been described.
[Sthiramati]
[1] The state therein is described immediately following the meditative develop-
ment of the counteragent, hence he asks: which are 158 the states in regard to the
latter? The words "in regard to the latter", signify: in regard to that meditative devel-
opment of the counteragent; hence he says:
IV.13 a
(a) The causal state, (b) that called
'arrival' etc.
Of these, (a) the causal state is that which pertains to an individual
stationed in a spiritual lineage. What is meant is: the spiritual lineage is the
cause, i.e. the 'seed'. In this respect, one who abides in a spiritual lineage, but not
among those whose resolve has been generated, is the person who is meant in this
context as being stationed in a spiritual lineage; furthermore, such a one enters into the
higher states and does not turn back. Some [schools] claim that the spiritual lineage
has the root of the wholesome for its essential nature because certain roots of the
wholesome are said to consist in the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka and so forth, up
until certain others are said to consist in the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva. Others
again believe that, with reference to the state of the ordinary person159, the differentia-
tion of the faculties is said to consist in the spiritual lineage and they claim that the
spiritual lineage refers to a capacity of the 'seed' of mind. When this exists, then, in the
Read: katama in place of ka; cf. Bhaşya N56.2.
Ms.(59a.5): prgjanya- which has been correctly amended to prthagjana- by Y; cf. his fn.2
p.188.Y189
255
state of the ordinary person¹60 and in the state of the one still in training, it is described
as the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka and so forth up until its description as the spiri-
tual lineage of the bodhisattva. However, one who is in the state of the adept is
described as a śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha or a Buddha161 and there is no spiritual
lineage on his part because of his pre-eminent state. Moreover, that [i.e. the spiritual
lineage] is differentiated as threefold according to one's differentiation as śrāvaka etc.
and is sixfold according to its differentiation as determinate and indeterminate 162.
[2] (b) The arrival state pertains to one whose resolve for enlightenment
has been generated. Such a person can be one of three types belonging respec-
tively to either the spiritual lineage of the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha or the tathāgata
because he generates the resolve for the enlightenment 163 of either the śrävaka, the
pratyekabuddha or the Perfectly Enlightened One. Since he arrives in the preparatory
[state] when the latter has originated, because it consists in the roots of preparation, its
generation is described as the state of arrival in preparation. (c) The preparatory
state is subsequent to the generation of the resolve, when the result has
not been attained. It is described as preparatory since, for one whose resolve for
enlightenment164 has been generated, it is the expedient which causes the attainment of
the first result by practising the wholesome roots 165, beginning with generosity and
morality and terminating in the meditative development of the powers. Why are the
causal and arrival states described as the states that comprise the meditative develop-
ment of the factors that contribute to enlightenment? Because they are causes of the
latter. Only because of this is it said that the generation of the resolve due to the spiri-
tual lineage has ever increasing results etc.166. (d) The state of result [occurs
when the latter] has been attained; i.e. when the first result [has been attained]
for preparation is undertaken for the sake of the result; hence, the state of result follows
immediately after the preparatory [state]. (e) The state with duties to be per-
formed pertains to one still in training167 because he has not completely
attained the results since there are duties still to be performed for the attainment of the
other results 168. (f) The state without duties to be performed pertains to

the adept. For, he is an adept insofar as being free from the passion that pertains to
the three realms of existence. It is the state without duties to be performed because
such a one has completely attained the results since there are no duties still to be per-
formed for the attainment of the other results. (g) The state of excellence
pertains to one endowed with the special qualities of the higher knowl-
edges etc. When there is the state of an arhat, one is endowed with the special quali-
ties such as the higher knowledges, [therefore], the state of the perfection of the special
qualities of the higher knowledges etc. is distinguished from other [states] and is
described as the state of excellence. (h) The superior state pertains to the
bodhisattva who has entered the spiritual levels above the śrävaka and
pratyekabuddhal69. Owing to the acquisition of the supramundane path which
penetrates 170 both the insubstantialities and is occupied with benefit for oneself and
others, the state of the latter is described as the superior state because it is superior to
other vehicles. (i) The unsurpassable state pertains to the Buddha. What is
the reason?171 He says: ...because there is no state subsequent to that. It
pertains to the Buddha [state] because this is the final basis 172 for the excellence and
absence of all virtues and faults [respectively]. It is described as unsurpassable
because another state of excellence subsequent to this cannot be found.
[3] Although [the explanation of the states in their entirety is complete because of
what has been discussed so far, in order to demonstrate the differentiation of the eleven
spiritual levels of the bodhisattva, the states beginning with the course of 173 firm con-
viction and terminating in the state of consecration etc. 174, are now described. How-
ever, in order to demonstrate the differentiation of the three Buddha Bodies, the three
beginning with the attainment state are also explained. In the above, the causal and
arrival states are to be known as being common to both bodhisattvas and others 175.
(a) The state of firm conviction pertains to the bodhisattvas on all the
spiritual levels that consists in the course of firm conviction. In this
regard, subsequent to the generation of the resolve [for enlightenment] and before his
entry to the spiritual levels, although [the aspirant] has not perceived reality, it is as
though he has perceived reality, [for] he comprehends the dharmas by way of the three
natures on account of his firm conviction in the Buddhas and the bodhisattvas. He is
intent upon the resources for the achievement of Buddhahood, i.e. generosity and
morality etc., which are difficult to perform for other sentient beings, thus this is

described as the course of firm conviction because it is characterized by the state of
firm resolve. Moreover, this 176 [continues] for countless aeons or more. (b) The
state of entry [pertains to the bodhisattva] on the first spiritual level; it
is described as the state of entry because, from the very beginning, through the direct
intuition of the three natures that is devoid of conceptual differentiation he has the
intuitive knowledge and penetration of reality. This same [level] is the path of vision
of the bodhisattva. (c) The state of setting forth, on the six spiritual levels
subsequent to the latter; these spiritual levels are described¹77 as the state of
setting forth because [the bodhisattva]: (a) reaches the end of the relinquishment of
notional attachment to the multiplicity of signs (nimitta) which is to be relinquished
through meditative development and (b) reaches the end of preparation that is accom-
panied by deliberate effort178. (d) The prophetic state, on the eighth¹7
179
spiritual level; due to the absence of deliberate effort 130 and conceptualization in
regard to all signs in every respect on the eighth level, it is prophesized through an
open prophecy by the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, that Buddhahood is certain. (e)
The state of teacher¹81, on the ninth; on the ninth level he obtains the four
analytical knowledges which are distinctly superior to [those of the śrävakas and
pratyekabuddhas and becomes an unsurpassable teacher of the universal Dharma. (f)
The state of consecration, on the tenth spiritual level182; for, on the tenth
level the bodhisattva has reached the end of the path and is consecrated by anointment
with rays of light from the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, who are stationed in the
world spheres of the ten directions. (g) The attainment state refers to the
Dharma Body of the Buddhas. It is the Dharma Body of the Buddhas since it:
(a) has the nature of the turning about of the basis, (b) has control over all dharmas and
(c) is without a foundation these are due to both the relinquishment of all obscuration
and the accumulation of the 'seeds' of all dharmas that are without impurity and which
act as counteragent to those [obscurations]. It is described as the attainment state
because by means of this [body the bodhisattva] reaches the culminating point in his
penetration of the dharmas. However, others claim that the extremely pure dharma-
dhātu is [equivalent to] the Dharma Body which is the Body of real nature
(dharmatākāya)183 because of the removal of adventitious stain in its entirety. Others

again believe that the Dharma Body consists in a distinctive direct intuition which
proceeds without attachment or hindrance in regard to everything knowable184. (h)
The state of benefit refers to the Enjoyment body. The Essential Nature
[Body] is the body established in which he becomes perfectly enlightened 185. The
Enjoyment Body is that body on account of which one experiences the Recitation of
the Dharma in the circle of assembly 186 together with the bodhisattvas who have
reached their final end. (i) The state of the performance of duty refers to the
Transformation Body ¹87. The Transformation Body is that which: (a) has the
Essential Nature Body for a basis, (b) takes heed of the aspirations of sentient beings
and (c) has infinite divisions in regard to the engagement in undertakings188 for the
sake of those to be trained.
[4] Moreover, all of these various states, in short, should be known as:
IV.15 b
Threefold in relation to the dharma-
thăm etc.
As to how this can be, he says:
IV.15 cd
(a) impure, (b) impure and pure and
(c) purified, as is appropriate. 189
Of these, (a) the impure state is inclusive of the causal state up until 190
the preparatory; i.e. the states of cause, arrival, preparation and firm conviction are
included. In relation to these states, the impure state is so-called because the stain of
the dharmadhatu has not been relinquished in its entirety. (b) The state that is
both impure and pure pertains to those who are still in training; and in
this context, the states of result, that with duties still to be performed 191, distinction,
superiority, entry, setting forth, prophecy, teacher and consecration are included.
Moreover, in relation to these states, the state that is both impure and pure is so-called
because the moral defilement of the dharmadhātu is both relinquished and not relin-
quished. (c) The purified state pertains to the adepts; i.e. the states without
duties still to be performed, distinction, superiority, attainment, benef and the perfor-
mance of duty are described as the purified state because the adepts have relinquished
moral defilement in its entirety.

[5] Furthermore, these states are respectively determined as being pertinent to: (a)
ordinary people, (b) those still in training and (c) the adepts. And as to the way in
which their various respective establishments should be discerned, he says:
IV.16 ab
Hence is the establishment of indi-
viduals 192 considered, as is fitting;
By "as is fitting" [is meant] according to circumstances. By "hence" is meant: as the
consequence of this differentiation of the states. In this way: "this [person] is
established in a spiritual lineage; that [person] has arrived and so on"
Because of the reference to the word "etc.", [the following possible differentiation of
individuals is understood]: this [person] has made preparation; ...has won the stream;
...is a once-returner; ...is a non-returner; ...is an arhat, ...possesses ornaments; ...is a
bodhisattva; ...is a tathāgata; ...courses in firm conviction; ...courses in a pure higher193
aspiration; has set forth; has been prophesized; ...is a teacher of the Dharma; ...has
been consecrated; ...has attained enlightenment; possesses deliberate effort;
...performs benefit for others.

3. The Attainment of the Result.
Which are the results that are attained?
IV.16 cd
The results respectively are: (a) the
fit vessel known as the karma-result,
(b) strength because of the influence
of the latter, (c) inclination, (d)
growth and (e) purification.
260
(a) The fit vessel refers to the karma-result that conforms with the
wholesome. (b) Strength which is [equivalent to] a preponderance of
the wholesome is due to the influence of the fit vessel. (c) Inclination
refers to the inclination towards the wholesome that is due to previous
practice. (d) Growth refers to the nourishment of the root of the
wholesome which is due to practice in regard to the wholesome dharmas
in the present. (e) Purification refers to the relinquishment of obscura-
tion. These fivefold results are to be known respectively as: (a) the
karma-result, (b) the influenced result, (c) the result as natural outcome,
(d) the result of human effort and (e) the result of dissociation.
IV.17 cd & 18 abcd
The other results are, in brief: (a) the
ever increasing, (b) the first, (c) due
to the practice of the latter, (d) due
to completion, (e) due to conformity,
(f) due to adverse elements, (g) due
to dissociation, (h) due to excel-
lence, (i) due to superiority and (j)
due to unsurpassability.
(a) The ever increasing result is to be understood as
a successive
development, i.e. the generation of the resolve is due to the spiritual
lineage, and so on. (b) The first result refers to the acquisition, from
the very beginning, of the supramundane dharmas. (c) The result of
practice follows after the latter in the state of one still in training. (d)
The completion result refers to the qualities of the adept. (e) The con-
forming result is to be known as the ever increasing result in its causal
mode. (f) The result of the adverse elements is [equivalent to the path
of relinquishment and is [to be known as the first result; [the adverseN58
261
Y193
elements are intended as counteragent¹94. (g) The dissociation-result,
i.e. the direct realization of cessation195, consists in both the result of
practice and completion result and refers to the dissociation from moral
defilement on the part of one still in training and the adept, respec-
tively. (h) The excellent result refers to the special qualities such as the
higher knowledges. (i) The superior result refers to the spiritual levels
of the bodhisattva because these are superior to the other vehicles. (j)
The unsurpassable result refers to the spiritual level of the Buddhas.
The latter four are divisions of the above-mentioned practice and com-
pletion results. The other results are [explained] by way of a
condensed explanation but in full detail they are immeasurable.
[Sthiramati]
Y192.19 [1] Since the state precedes the result, in order to comment on the result immediately
after the states, he asks: which are the results that are attained? Hence he says:
IV.16 c
...(a) The fit vessel known as the
karma-result etc.
In brief, the result is fivefold: (a) the fit vessel, (b) strength, (c) inclination, (d) growth
and (e) purification. Of these, (a) the fit vessel refers to the karma-result that
conforms with the wholesome. Now, that which consists in: (a) the relinquish-
ment of the eight inopportune births, (b) the six sense-fields distinguished as impure
and (c) the karma-result of the dharmas that contribute to enlightenment, is described as
the fit vessel because it is the basis for the production of all wholesome dharmas. (b)
Strength which is [equivalent to a preponderance of the root196 of the
wholesome, what is meant is: a thriving condition, ...is due to the influence of
the fit vessel; i.e. it is on account of the feeble production of moral defilement on the
part of the basis [i.e. the physical body]197 - this is described as strength. (c) Incli-
nation198 refers to the inclination towards the wholesome which is due
to previous practice 199. Due to the practice of the wholesome dharmas in previous
lives, there is a tendency towards [the practice of] wholesome dharmas in the present
life, according to the analogy of a river and its currents 200 - this is inclination. (d)
Growth refers to the nourishment of the root of the wholesome201 - thus

262
is the intended meaning which is due to the practice of the dharmas that
consist in the root202 of the wholesome in the present203, i.e. the production
of excellent wholesome dharmas that were non-existent in the past. This is the differ-
ence between strength and growth, for strength consists in firmness in regard to the
karma-result of the feeble wholesome [dharmas]204. Whereas, growth refers to the
ever increasing excellence in wholesome (dharmas]. Others again believe that in this
context, the statement: "the nourishment of the root of the wholesome", is intended to
signify the nourishment of the latent impressions of the excellent wholesome dharmas.
(e) Purification refers to the relinquishment of obscuration. For those
who belong to the spiritual lineages of the śrävaka and the pratyeka buddha, purifica-
tion, in this regard, refers to the relinquishment of obscuration that consists moral
defilement; but for those who belong to the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattva205,
purification refers to the relinquishment of both the obscuration that consists moral
defilement as well as the cognizable.
[2] These fivefold results are [to be known] respectively as: (i) the
karma-result; i.e. the karma-result that is conformable with the wholesome dharmas.
(ii) The influenced result; i.e. the preponderance of wholesome [dharmas] that is
due to the influence of the fit vessel. (iii) The result as natural outcome; i.e. the
inclination towards the wholesome that is due to previous practice. (iv) The result
of human effort; i.e. the nourishment of the root of the wholesome that is due to the
practice of the wholesome dharmas in the present. (v) The result of dissociation;
i.e. the relinquishment of obscuration.
[3] The division of these fivefold results that have been mentioned briefly, is now
explained in brief:
IV.17 C
[The other results are, in brief]: (a)
the ever increasing, (b) the first 206
etc.
(a) The ever increasing result is to be known as a successive develop-
ment of the states as described above, i.e. the generation of the resolve is due
to the spiritual lineage, the preparatory [state] is due to the generation of the
resolve, and so on. (b) The first result refers to the acquisition, from the
very beginning, of the supramundane dharmas; i.e. the attainment of the path
of vision. (c) The result of practice follows after the latter in the state of
202 müla is omitted from the Bhasya; cf. N57.12.

as well as P Tika (cf. 130b.4); however, D(283b.6): da Ita byuń ba- supports the Ms.(61a.3)

206 Read: adyan in place of adis; cf. Bhaşya N57.16.(195
263
one still in training207; i.e. the results pertinent to both the once-returner and the
non-returner in the state of one who is still in training which is comprised of the five
individuals and is subsequent to the path of vision. It is the result of practice because it
consists in the path of meditative development which is subsequent to that [state]
accompanied by preparation. (d) The completion result refers to the qualities
of the adept. Now, these are called: correct view, correct intention, correct speech,
correct action, correct livelihood, correct effort, correct mindfulness, correct meditative
concentration as well as liberation and insight into the direct intuition that constitutes
liberation. It is described as the completion result because it is situated at the end of all
the results. (e) The conforming result is to be known as the ever increas-
ing result in its causal mode. The causal mode (upanișadbhāva) is [equivalent
to] the cause (hetu)208; i.e. because the generation of the resolve therein conforms with
the spiritual lineage, the generation of the resolve is [the conforming] result209. It
should be known that there are separate respective teachings, by way of statement and
explanation, for the ever increasing result etc. and the conforming result etc. (f) The
result of the adverse elements is [equivalent to the path of relinquish-
ment and is [to be known as] the first result210; because the adverse elements
themselves are the result, this is [described as] the result of the adverse elements on
account of which the path of relinquishment becomes dissociated from moral defile-
ment. The first result is that which was mentioned previously as: "the acquisition,
from the beginning, of the supramundane dharmas". Although the term "adverse
element" (vipakşa) is [often] described as an obscuration in the sense that it is a
hindrance to the counteragent, in this context, the adverse elements are intended
as the counteragent211, for the word can be analysed in this way: the adverse
(vipakṣa) is the side (pakşa) that impedes (vi-ghātana) 212 obscuration. (g) The
dissociation-result consists in both the result of practice and comple-
tion-result and refers to the dissociation from moral defilement on the
part of one still in training and the adept, respectively. Dissociation as the
result of practice pertains to the five still in training, beginning with the once-returner's
entry into the result, because they possess residual moral defilement213. Dissocia-

tion214 as the completion result pertains to the six adepts, beginning with the one
susceptible to fall215, because these have relinquished all moral defilement belonging to
the three realms of existence, without remainder. The above [results] have been
described by way of their differentiation, now the excellent [result is described] since it
is not differentiated: (h) the excellent result refers to the special qualities
such as the higher knowledges216. This should be understood just as the excel-
lence of the practice and completion results217. What is the reason? Because
[Vasubandhu] has in mind the acquisition of the special qualities on the part of the
non-returners, the arhats, the pratyekabuddhas, the bodhisattvas, and the tathāgatas.
(i) The superior result refers to the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva218;
here he provides the reason: because these are superior to the other
vehicles 219. Even though the spiritual levels of the bodhisattva consist in both the
first result and the result of practice, because these have the natures of the paths of
vision and meditative development, nevertheless, in relation to the śrävaka and pratyeka-
buddha vehicles, the superior result is to be known to pertain to the spiritual levels 220
of the bodhisattva because: (a) it is devoid of conceptual differentiation, (b) it belongs
to the spiritual lineage of the Buddhas and (c) it is the result of universal enlighten-
ment 221. j) The unsurpassable result refers to the spiritual level of the
Buddhas. This consists only in the completion result since it is due to the relin-
quishment of all moral defilement and secondary defilement together with their latent
impressions, and is also due to the relinquishment of undefiled nescience. It is
described as the unsurpassable result because there is no other spiritual level222 that is
superior to it.
[4] The other results are [explained] by way of a condensed explana-
tion, however in full detail they are immeasurable223. In full detail, the
results that are set forth pertinent to the śrävakas, the pratyekabuddhas, the bodhi-
sattvas and the Perfectly Enlightened Ones are immeasurable.

The Summary Meaning of the Meditative
Development of the Counteragent, the State
Therein and the Result.
265
The summary meaning of the meditative development of the counter-
agent consists in: (a) the meditative development of comprehensive
learning, (b) the meditative development of abstinence, (c) the medita-
tive development of the necessary preparation, (d) the meditative devel-

The summary meaning of the state consists in: (a) the future state of
one stationed in the spiritual lineage, (b) the state of undertaking, up

The summary meaning of the result consists in those that are due to:
(a) aggregation, (b) the distinction of the latter, (c) previous practice,
(d) ever increasing accomplishment, (e) statements and (f) explanations.
Of these, (a) that which is due to the aggregation refers to the five
results. (b) that which is due to the distinction of the latter refers to the
remaining [results]. (c) That which is due to previous practice refers to
the karma-result. (d) That which is due to ever increasing accomplish-
ment refers to the other four. (e) That which is due to statements refers
to the four beginning with the ever increasing result. (f) That which is
due to explanations refers to the six beginning with the conforming
result because these are the explanations of the latter four.

Y196.2 [1] The summary meaning of the meditative development of the counter-
agent consists in: (a) the meditative development of comprehensive
learning; i.e. the meditative development of the applications of mindfulness due to
comprehensive learning in regard to the four noble truths. (b) The meditative
development of abstinence; i.e. the meditative development of the correct exer-
tions due to abstinence from unwholesome dharmas. (c) The meditative devel-
opment of the necessary preparation; i.e. the meditative development of the
bases of psychic power, for these facilitate the necessary preparation for meditative
concentration because one's devotion to the eight formative forces that facilitate relin-
quishment leads to the relinquishment of the five faults. (d) The meditative
development of higher enterprise; i.e. the meditative development of the
faculties that results from the generation of the root of the wholesome which is con-
ducive to liberation. (e) The connected meditative development 225; i.e. the
meditative development of the powers226 because of the connection with the
path of vision. (f) The meditative development of entry; the meditative
development of the limbs of enlightenment because therein one enters into reality 227,
either due to entry into the supramundane dharmas, or else, due to entry into the Noble
Path²28. (g) The superior meditative development; i.e. the meditative devel-
opment [component] of the path because the path of meditative development is superior
to the path of vision. (h) The meditative development of the beginning 229;
i.e. in the state of the ordinary person it is either conformable, or else, erroneously
inverted. (i) The meditative development of the middle; i.e. in the state of one
still in training it is not erroneously inverted but is encumbered by erroneous inver-
sion 230. (j) The meditative development of the end; i.e. in the state of the
adept it is not erroneously inverted and is free from the encumbrance of erroneous
inversion. (k) The higher meditative development231; i.e. that pertinent to the
śrāvaka etc. (1) The unsurpassable meditative development232; i.e. that perti-
nent to the bodhisattva, which is distinguished in terms of objective
support, mental attention and attainment. The summary meaning of meditative
development has now been set forth233.

[2] The summary meaning of the state consists in: (a) the future state;
i.e. the causal state. (b) The state of undertaking refers to preparation
together with the generation of the resolve234. (c) The impure and pure
state; i.e. the two states: the state of result and the state of duties still to be performed.
(d) The purified state; i.e. the state without duties still to be performed. (e) The
state accompanied by ornamentation; i.e. the state of excellence. (f) The per-
vading state; i.e. the higher state it is described as the pervading state because it
pervades the ten spiritual levels of the bodhisattvas. (g) The unsurpassable
state; i.e. that of the Buddhas, the Venerable Ones, for there is no other state superior
to it. And this refers to the attainment state, the state of benefit and 235 the state of the
performance of duty, which have been previously described.
[3] The summary meaning of the result consists in those that are due to:
(a) the aggregation, (b) the distinction of the latter, (c) previous
practice, (d) ever increasing accomplishment, (e) statements and (f)
explanations. The author of the commentary himself provides an exposition of
these of these, (a) that which is due to aggregation refers to the five
results; i.e. those beginning with the karma-result since all the results are included in
these. (b) That which is due to the distinction of the latter refers to the
remaining [results]; i.e. the differentiation of those same five. The remaining
[results] should be known as those beginning with the ever increasing result. (c)
That which is due to previous practice refers to the karma-result; i.e. the
karma-result in the present life which is due to the accumulation of wholesome
[dharmas] in past lives. Since it arises in conformity with the wholesome, it is
described as being due to previous practice. (d) That which is due to ever
increasing accomplishment refers to the other four; i.e. the influenced result,
the result as natural outcome, the result of human effort and the result of dissociation.
In relation to these, strength refers to what is accomplished through the karma-result;
inclination refers to what is accomplished through strength; growth refers to what is
accomplished through inclination; purification refers to what is accomplished through
growth. Some believe it is described as an ever increasing accomplishment because it
is characterized by successive expositions. (e) That which is due to statements
refers to the four beginning with the ever increasing result; i.e. the ever
increasing result, the first result, the result of practice and the completion-result. (f)
That which is due to explanations refers to the six beginning with the
conforming result because these are the explanations of the latter

increasing result; the result of adverse elements is [equivalent to] the explanation of the
first result; the result of dissociation is [equivalent to] the explanation of both the result
of practice and the completion-result. And the excellent result, the superior result and
the unsurpassable result are [equivalent to] the explanation of that same completion-
result because [Vasubandhu] has in mind the possession of ornamentation on its part.
However, others believe237 that the excellent result is {equivalent to] just the explana-
tion of the results of practice and completion, because it is possible for the non-returner
also [to possess] the qualities of the higher knowledges etc., whereas, the unsurpass-
able result is [equivalent to] the explanations of the completion-result.

The Supremacy of the VehicleN60.3

1. The Three Kinds of Supremacy.

270
The supremacy of the vehicle should now be mentioned it is said:
V.1 abc
Supremacy is considered as listed in
relation to: (a) spiritual practice, (b)
objective support and (c) full attain-
ment.
The threefold supremacies which are [incorporated] in the universal
vehicle and on account of which it is the supreme vehicle are: (a)
supremacy of spiritual practice, (b) supremacy of objective support and
(c) supremacy of full attainment.
[2] Alternatively, the Meditative Development of the Counteragent, the State Therein
and the Attainment of the Result were explained as common to both the śrävaka etc.
and the bodhisattva; however, because they do not share the same states³, the
supremacy of the vehicle is not common to both the bodhisattva and the śrāvaka etc.
And in order to demonstrate that it is described as the chief object in this context, he
says: "the supremacy of the vehicle should now be mentioned it is said:...". Since
there is nothing higher than this, the word 'supremacy' is a synonym for 'excellence'.
But what is this? It is the universal vehicle, for thus, inasmuch as the universal vehicle
is superior to both the śrävaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles, there is none other that is
more excellent compared with the universal vehicle because of the proportional differ-
ences in cause and result in regard to it. Supremacy (ānuttarya) refers to the state
(bhava) of that which is supreme (anuttarasya); but just what is this? Hence he says:
[Sthiramati]
[1] The supremacy of the vehicle was [initially] listed immediately after the listing of
the six subjects, such as the Characteristics and the Obscurations2; hence, subsequent
to the explanation of these, the subject under discussion is the explanation of the
Supremacy of the Vehicle. Consequently, he says: the supremacy of the vehicle
should now be mentioned it is said:... The [word] "now" means
"immediately following the explanation of the six [subjects] such as the Characteristic".
The intended meaning is: because it was listed immediately after those [subjects].

Supremacy [is considered as listed]
in relation to: (a) spiritual practice4
etc.
[3] Alternatively, the universal vehicle refers to the direct intuition devoid of all the
discursive elaboration of conceptual discrimination in accompaniment with its associ-
ated elements, the accumulations, application, subsequently attained direct intuition, the
special qualities, objective support and result. Of these, the objective support refers to
thusness; the result refers to the nirvāṇa in which the bodhisattva is not permanently
fixed. And the universal vehicle refers to the teachings such as the Sütras which are
expressive of this universal vehicle. Moreover, the [name of the] text is applied figur-
atively for its subject matter, just as the "Slaying of Kamsa" is [figuratively used] for
271
The threefold supremacies which are [incorporated in the universal
vehicle...5 But what is this universal vehicle? Just these three: (a) spiritual prac-
tice, (b) objective support and (c) full attainment. Of these, (a) the
supremacy of spiritual practice refers to the accomplishment of the ten perfections, i.e.
the spiritual practice of the bodhisattva is described as supreme in regard to the accom-
plishment of the perfections. (b) Moreover, the objective support refers to the dharmas
of the perfections etc. and to the dharmadhâtu. By means of this objective support, the
bodhisattvas have the capacity to provide benefit without remainder for others6; hence,
the supremacy of objective support refers to its being the cause of the capacity to pro-
vide benefit for others. Why? This the objective support of the bodhisattvas is
described as supreme because it belongs to him. (c) Full attainment refers to the result
of: (i) the spiritual lineage, (ii) firm conviction and (iii) the generation of the resolve
[for enlightenment] etc. Since the [bodhisattva] reaches full knowledge
[samudāgacchanti] or attains this due to the spiritual lineage etc., it is [described as] full
attainment (samudāgama]; and it is described as supreme because there is no other full
attainment superior to this. Consequently, in this context, supremacy refers to the
absence of anything other that is superior to that full attainment. And in this respect, it
is said that the spiritual practice of the bodhisattvas, together with its foundation and
results, consists in the universal vehicle. Moreover, it is described as supreme on
account of the threefold supremacy that has just been described.

the 'stealing of jewels'9. It is universal (mahat) because it possesses the seven kinds of
universality; it is a vehicle (yāna) since [the bodhisattva) reaches the unfixed nirvāṇa
travelling (yanti) by means of it. Since it is both a vehicle and is universal, it is the
universal vehicle 10. Furthermore, its sevenfold universality refers to universality in
regard to: (a) objective support, (b) spiritual practice, (c) direct intuition, (d) vigour, (e)
expedients, (f) attainment and (g) action. Of these, (a) the universality in regard to
objective support refers to the Dharma of the endless Sutras, such as the Hundred
Thousand [Prajñāpāramitā], for these form the objective support for the path of the
bodhisattva. (b) The universality in regard to spiritual practice is the result of spiritual
practice concerned with benefit in its entirety for both oneself and others. (c) The
universality in regard to direct intuition is due to knowledge of insubstantiality in
regard to the personal entity and the dharmas. (d) The universality in regard to vigour
is due to application in regard to the many hundreds of thousands of difficult tasks [to
be performed] over three countless aeons. (e) The universality in regard to skill in
expedients is due to the fact that [the bodhisattva] is fixed neither in samsāra nor
nirvāņa. (f) The universality in regard to attainment is due to the understanding of the
immeasurable and countless virtues, such as the powers, self-confidence and the
special Buddha qualities. (g) The universality in regard to actions is due to the perfor-
mance of the acts of the Buddha by revealing his enlightenment for as long as samsāra
exists. Only this universal vehicle is supreme; the state of the latter is [described as]
supremacy because there is no vehicle that is superior to it. Furthermore, it consists
in spiritual practice, objective support and full attainment, for thus, the universal vehicle
is described as supreme because it possesses these [three] elements. There is
supremacy of spiritual practice since spiritual practice supreme; the supremacy of
objective support and the supremacy of full attainment should be understood in the
same way. These supremacies are respectively determined with reference to: (a) the
path of the bodhisattva, (b) its support and (c) the result of that [path]. Moreover, it is
just these that are referred to through the statements of the Buddha, viz.: spiritual prac-
tice, objective support and the result of that (practice).
It difficult to establish the full significance of this analagy; perhaps it refers to the
appropriation of Kamsa's wealth etc. by Krşna after he had killed him.

These are the six kinds of spiritual practice, namely: (a) the highest
spiritual practice, (b) spiritual practice in regard to mental attention, (c)
spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma, (d) spiritual practice
that avoids the two extremes, (e) specific spiritual practice and (f) non-
specific spiritual practice.
[Sthiramati]
Y201.12 [1] Although it is fitting that the objective support be explained firstly because spiritual
practice is preceded by the objective support, spiritual practice is mentioned initially in
order to demonstrate that it is the essence of the practice of the bodhisattvas. Of
these, how is the supremacy of spiritual practice [to be known]? Hence he says: the
supremacy of spiritual practice is to be known by way of the practice of
the ten perfections. The spiritual practice of the perfections is [equivalent to] the
performance of the perfections; and since this spiritual practice of the perfections is
explained only in the universal vehicle and not in any other vehicle¹2, he shows the
universal vehicle to be supreme. Moreover, this spiritual practice becomes supreme
while [the bodhisattva] is applying himself to the perfections in their various modes;
and in order to illustrate these modes, he says:

The highest consists in twelve:
(a) Magnanimity, (b) duration, (c)
prerogative, (d) inexhaustibility, (e)
continuity, (f) non-hardship, (g)
wealth and (h) possession;
(i) Enterprise, (j) acquisition, (k)
natural outcome and (1) accom-
plishment these are considered as
highest.
274
These twelve types are considered as highest, namely: (a) the highest
degree of magnanimity, (b) the highest degree of duration, (c) the high-
est degree of prerogative, (d) the highest degree of inexhaustibility, (e)
the highest degree of continuity, (f) the highest degree of non-hardship,
(g) the highest degree of wealth, (h) the highest degree of possession,
(i) the highest degree of enterprise, (j) the highest degree of acquisi-
tion, (k) the highest degree of natural outcome and (1) the highest
degree of accomplishment.
Of these, (a) the highest degree of magnanimity is to be known as
not seeking after all mundane success and also as pre-eminence. (b)
The highest degree of duration is due to the cultivation [of the perfec-
tions] for three countless aeons. (c) The highest degree of prerogative
is due to the prerogative for deeds of benefit for all beings.
(d) The
highest degree of inexhaustibility is due to the complete absence of
exhaustion on account of the transformation into universal enlighten-
ment. (e) The highest degree of continuity is due to a firm conviction
in the sameness of self and others due to the fulfilment of the perfec-
tions of generosity etc. in regard to all beings. (f) The highest degree
of non-hardship is due to the fulfilment of the perfections of generosity
etc. on the part of others, through his approval alone. (g) The highest
degree of wealth is due to the fulfilment of generosity etc. by means of
the "treasury of the sky" meditative concentration etc. (h) The highest
degree of possession is due to the possession [by the bodhisattva] of
direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differentiation. (i) The
highest degree of enterprise refers to the abundant measure of patience
on the spiritual level of the one who courses in firm conviction. (j) The№62
275
highest degree of acquisition refers to the first spiritual level. (k) The
highest degree of natural outcome refers to the eight spiritual levels
subsequent to the latter. (1) The highest degree of accomplishment
refers to the tenth spiritual level and to that of the tathāgata since these
are the [respective] accomplishments of (a) the bodhisattva and (b) the
Buddhas.

Consequently, the ten perfections are
considered in the highest sense;
Since these twelvefold [spiritual practices] exist in the highest
degree within the latter [i.e. the perfections], consequently, the ten per-
fections [are considered]¹3 in this sense, i.e. as highest. As to which
are these ten and in order to disclose their names, it is said:
V.5 abcd
(a) Generosity, (b) morality, (c)
patience, (d) vigour, (e) meditative
absorption, (f) wisdom, (g) expedi-
ency, (h) vows, (i) strength and (j)
direct intuition these are the ten
perfections.
Which are the individual actions pertinent to each of these?
V.6 abcdef
Actions that: (a) are of assistance,
(b) are non-violent, (c) endure such

have the capacity to initiate and (f)
to liberate, (g) are inexhaustible, (h)
engage constantly [in generosity] (i)
engage eternally in [generosity], (j)
are enjoyable and bring [beings] to
maturity.
These are the respective actions that pertain to the latter [i.e. to the
perfections] for, (a) through his generosity, the bodhisattva assists
beings. (b) On account of his morality, he does not injure others. (c)
Through patience, he endures the injury inflicted by others. (d)
Through vigour, he increases his virtues. (e) Through the meditative
absorptions, he initiates beings, having attracted them by means of his
psychic power etc. (f) Through his wisdom, he liberates them by
providing correct counsel. (g) Through the perfection of skill in expe-

dients, he causes his generosity etc. to become inexhaustible due to the
transformation into universal enlightenment. (h) Through the perfection
of vows, he engages in generosity etc. at all times while rejoicing in the
birth of a Buddha in all his lives due to his possession of favourable
rebirths. (i) Through the perfection of strength, he engages eternally in
generosity etc. due to the strength of his critical consideration and
meditative development because he is not overcome by adverse ele-
ments. (j) Through the perfection of direct intuition, since it removes
confusion about the literal meaning of the Dharma, he experiences in
return the enjoyment of the Dharma which has generosity etc.

The highest consists in twelve:
What is meant is: the highest [spiritual practice] which is vast and unsurpassable has
twelve modes in order to demonstrate these modes, he says:
V.3 a
(a) Magnanimity, (b) duration etc.
From the highest degree of magnanimity up until the highest degree of
accomplishment; these twelve types are considered as highest ¹4. Of
these, the highest degree of magnanimity is to be known as not seeking
after¹5 all mundane16 success and also as pre-eminence. Success is
[equivalent to] prosperity; and this has two aspects: (a) that which is attained and (b)
that not attained. Of these, [the bodhisattva] does not become attached to what is
attained nor does he strive for what is not attained because he applies himself to the
removal of the suffering of others without regard for his own happiness. As has been
stated:
O virtuous one, what fruit of merit you
have; all that is for the benefit of others, not
for your own sake¹7.
It is [also described as] pre-eminence18 because its fruit is Buddhahood which is

endowed with relinquishment, direct intuition and might. Alternatively, the sublime
person is generally described as being of two sorts: (a) munificent and (b) devoid of
the desire for services in return. Therefore, the bodhisattva does not strive for all mun-
dane success ¹9 but applies himself to the perfections, such as generosity, which are
ever increasing. This is what is described as the magnanimity of spiritual practice.
[2] The highest degree of duration...; its pre-eminence is on account of its
duration. Moreover, duration refers to the extended practice of the perfections begin-
ning with generosity. And since it is not known as to how long this endures, he says:
is due to the cultivation [of the perfections] for three countless aeons.
For, the bodhisattvas' meditative development of the perfections, such as generosity, is
of exceeding duration because it is completed over three countless aeons.
[3] The highest degree of prerogative20 is due to the prerogative for
deeds of benefit for all beings21. It is described as the highest by way of pre-
rogative22 (adhikārataḥ) since the bodhisattvas engage in generosity etc. without
regard for their own happiness for the sake of (adhikṛtya) bringing about welfare and
happiness for all beings.
[4] The highest degree of inexhaustibility 23...; it is of the highest degree on
account of the fact that it is inexhaustible; but what is its inexhaustibility due to? Hence
he says: is due to the complete absence of exhaustion on account of the
transformation into universal enlightenment24. Even after yielding the karma-
result in all places of rebirth (the perfections], such as generosity which consist in the
transformation into universal enlightenment, are not completely severed. Even in the
nirväņa devoid of the remnants of existence they are not exhausted due to: (a) the pro-
duction of the Dharma Body which is characterized by the turning about of the basis
and (b) the inexhaustibility of that [Dharma Body]. However, they are severed in the
nirvāṇa realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence through the transformation
into enlightenment of the śrävaka etc. due to the severance of the basis [i.e. the body 125
in every respect.
[5] Alternatively, [the perfections] such as generosity become inexhaustible through
the transformation into universal enlightenment due to the abundant karma-result; and
what is abundant is said to be inexhaustible because it is not completely exhausted
through the yielding of the karma-result. But the transformation into enlightenment of

the śrävaka etc. is not inexhaustible in this way. Or else, for the bodhisattvas, the roots
of the wholesome that are transformed into universal enlightenment for the benefit of
beings become inexhaustible, like the realms of beings; hence, like the realms of
beings, they are not completely exhausted.
[6] The highest degree of continuity is due to a firm conviction in the
sameness of self and others due to the fulfilment of the perfections of
generosity etc. in regard to all beings26. For, on the Joyous spiritual level, the
bodhisattva becomes firmly convinced of the sameness of self and others because of
his awareness of the all-pervading meaning 27 of the dharmadhātu. Having relin-
quished conceptual differentiation in regard to self and others due to his firm convic-
tion in the sameness of self and others he obtains an extremely joyous mind on account
of others' generosity etc., just as he does on account of his own generosity etc. As the
consequence this the perfections, such as generosity, are continually fulfilled every
instant, every moment and every day.
[7] The highest degree of non-hardship is due to the fulfillment of the
perfection of generosity etc. on the part of others, through his approval
alone. The bodhisattvas with joyous mind express their approval of the roots of the
wholesome, such as the generosity of beings, in such a way that the perfections, such
as generosity, of those [beings] is fulfilled through that approval alone.
[8] The highest degree of wealth is due to the fulfillment of generosity
etc. on account of the 'treasury of the sky' meditative concentration etc.
The bodhisattvas obtain the meditative concentration called 'treasury of the sky' through
meditative development which penetrates the dharmadhātu. From obtaining this, they
cause the fulfillment of the perfection of generosity because they are then able to fulfill
all the aspirations of sentient beings. For, under the influence of this, the very sky
(gagana) becomes a treasury (gañja) - thus it is designated as the 'treasury of the sky'
(gagana-ganja) meditative concentration. Alternatively, a treasury (gańja) is established
in the sky (gagana)28 because all of the necessities of life are produced from the sky
through the power of this meditative concentration29. By the word "etc." the meditative
concentrations that are taught in the Sutras of the Prajñāpäramitãs etc. are referred to.
[9] The highest degree of possession is due to the possession [by the
bodhisattva] of direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differenti-
ation. For the bodhisattvas' direct intuition is devoid of conceptual differentiation³0

[10] The highest degree of enterprise refers to an abundant measure of
patience on the spiritual level of the one who courses in firm convic-
tion. The first immeasurable aeon is described as the level of the one who courses in
firm conviction. Moreover, through the force of the spiritual lineage and friends, there
is, in those whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated, a totally firm convic-
tion33 in the insubstantiality of the dharmas in terms of the three natures this consists
in an abundant measure of patience which is not overpowered by adverse elements
such as lack of faith34. For this is the state of enterprise of the bodhisattva, and as a
consequence, his patience in abundant measure is described as the highest degree of
enterprise.

due to their non-perception of the trio, i.e. the giver³1, the object given and the recipient.
Similarly, their direct intuition is devoid of conceptual differentiation due to their non-
perception of [the three modes of the other nine perfections³2] up until the knower,
object of knowledge and the knowledge itself. The spiritual practice of generosity etc.
is encompassed by that highest direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.
How so? Because it conforms with that [direct intuition] and because it has the latter
as objective support hence is it described as highest.
[11] The highest degree of acquisition refers to the first spiritual level.
For the supramundane perfections are obtained on the first spiritual level because of
[the bodhisattvas] awareness of the all-pervading nature of 'the dharmadhātu. How-
since the mundane [perfections] were included previously by way of the prepara-
tion for the first spiritual level, it is said that on the first spiritual level there is the high-
est degree of acquisition.
ever,
[12] The highest degree of natural outcome refers to the eight [spiritual
levels] subsequent to the latter. Acquisition that is distinctively superior on the
eight spiritual levels other than the latter [i.e. the first] is the natural outcome of the per-
fections acquired on the first spiritual level³5, thus it is the highest degree of natural
outcome. Alternatively, the highest degree of acquisition refers to the acquisition of the
first spiritual level through the force of the meditative development of the perfections
on the level of the one who courses in firm conviction. A quotation from a Sūtra
states:

The remaining spiritual levels are the highest degree of natural outcome because they
are the outcome38 of the first level acquired through the force of the meditative devel-
opment 39 of the perfections. Or again, the highest degree of natural outcome refers to
the eight spiritual levels [other than the first] because they are the natural outcome of
the perfections that are acquired on the first level.
lineage of the tathāgata³6 due to his acquisition of the qualities that have its
nature and are in conformity with it.37
[13] The highest degree of accomplishment refers to the tenth spiritual
level and to that of the tathāgata 40 since these are the [respective]
accomplishments of (a) the bodhisattvas and (b) the Buddhas.
(a) Since
the bodhisattva reaches the end of all the bodhisattva courses on the tenth spiritual
level, he is consecrated there41 as an incumbent (Buddha] by the tathāgatas. There is
the highest degree of accomplishment for the bodhisattvas on the tenth spiritual level42
because of: (i) the fulfilment of an inconceivable accumulation of merit and direct
intuition; (ii) the absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to all dharmas and (iii)
the production of benefit, in every respect, for oneself and others. (b) But on the spiri-
tual level of the tathāgatas43, since the Venerable One becomes the teacher of the whole
world because he attains pre-eminence in relinquishment, direct intuition and might
hence there is accomplishment as the full accomplishment of the Buddhas. But what is
this accomplishment? It is the achievement of the qualities of the bodhisattva and of
the qualities of the Buddha, in every respect.

[14] Alternatively, the culmination of the perfections that are included on the level of
one still in training is [equivalent to] the tenth spiritual level; hence, there the full
accomplishment of the bodhisattva on that [level]. The highest limit of [the perfec-
tions] that are included on the level of the adept is (equivalent to the Buddha level.
Since training in the perfections is no longer present on that level, there is full accom-
plishment as the full accomplishment of the Buddhas. Thus, the highest degree of full
accomplishment is to be known as: (a) the full accomplishment of the bodhisattvas on
the tenth spiritual level and (b) the full accomplishment of the Buddha on the level of
the tathāgata.

Consequently, the ten perfections are
considered 44 in the highest sense.
Since these 45 twelvefold [spiritual practices] exist in the highest degree
within the latter [i.e. in the perfections], such as in the generosity [practised
by] the bodhisattva, but not in the generosity etc. of the śrävaka, consequently, the
ten perfections beginning with generosity and concluding with direct intuition
which pertain just to the bodhisattva are considered in this sense, i.e. as high-
est according to the rules of etymology. Thus it is just the spiritual practice that
pertains to the ten46 perfections which is said to be of the highest degree.
V.4 cd
[16] Of these [means] of these perfections, with regard to which, even their mere
name has not been disclosed; in order to disclose their names, it is said:
V.5 abcd
(a) Generosity, (b) morality, (c)
patience, (d) vigour, (e) meditative
absorption, (f) wisdom47, (g) expedi-
ency, (h) vows, (i) the powers and
(j) direct intuition these are the ten
perfections.
It was stated that "the highest degree of prerogative is due to the prerogative for deeds
of benefit for all beings"48, hence the question is asked: which are the actions
pertinent to each of these? Therefore he says:
V.6 ab
Actions that: (a) are of assistance,
281
(b) are non-violent, (c) endure such
[violence] etc.
45
46
For, through generosity, the bodhisattva assists beings. (a) In this regard,
because he is irreproachable on account of his wish to honour and assist [beings], one
who is indifferent to both the service49 in return for a favour and the karma-result
abandons objective and subjective entities on account of a particular volition and
bestows [gifts on beings] through his acts of body and speech this is the material
generosity of the bodhisattva. By means of this he assists beings by taking away their
sufferings of hunger and thirst etc. (b) The instructions to do with modes of living,
scriptural treatises, arts and crafts and [the practice of] non-violence towards beings,
[instructions] which are preceded by compassion, as well as the instructions on propit-
ious states of existence and the path to liberation, are the gifts of the Dharma. More-

over, by means of these [the bodhisattva] assists beings by removing the sufferings of
samsāra due to (wrong) modes of living and wretched states of existence. (c) The gift
of fearlessness consists of liberation for those who are attacked by kings 50, thieves,
kinsmen or beasts of prey etc. and thereby he assists beings by removing the fear of
calamity to life, enjoyment, children and wife etc.
[17] He does not injure these [beings]51 on account of his morality.
Morality refers to abstention from all misdeeds of body and speech, and, in keeping
with worldly practice, abstention (from the acts of body and speech) which are forbid-
den and the performance of the acts of body and speech that are prescribed. Because
he is established in this morality [the bodhisattva), even for the sake of his life, does
not injure or offend beings himself, nor does he cause others to do so.
[18] Through patience, he endures the injury inflicted 52 by others.
Patience consists in the endurance and toleration of all forms of suffering with a mind
predominated by compassion. On account of this (the bodhisattva] endures injury
such as murder53, bondage or the beatings inflicted by others, because he has no wish
to retaliate54.
[19] Through vigour, he increases his virtues. Vigour is a strength of will
with reference to generosity etc.; increase is the accomplishment of superior virtues due
to the practice of the virtues of generosity etc. on account of that [vigour].
[20] Through the meditative absorptions, he initiates [beings], having
attracted them by means of his psychic power etc. By the word "etc.", the
knowledge of the mental make-up of others 55 is included. Meditative absorption refers
to meditative concentration, i.e. the single-pointedness of mind. Psychic power is [the
power of] flying through the air etc. Initiation refers to the exposition of the real nature
of the teachings because those who are attracted by psychic power and the extra-
ordinary ability to read the thoughts [of others], which result from the meditative
absorptions, have the capacity to be initiated in the teachings.
[21] Through his wisdom, he liberates [beings] by providing correct
counsel56. Wisdom is characterized by the investigation of the dharmas in all
aspects; moreover, the action pertinent to this is the provision of correct counsel and
the relinquishment of moral defilement, [both of which are dependent upon instruc-

tions that are free from erroneous inversion. Hence, [the bodhisattval liberates
[beings] through his wisdom by providing correct counsel.
[22] Through the perfection of skill in expedients, he causes his gen-
erosity etc. to become inexhaustible due to the transformation into
universal enlightenment. An expedient is a particular device for the accomplish-
ment, the augmentation, the attainment or the relinquishment of a dharma; therefore, the
skill or proficiency in regard to that is [described as] the skill in expedients. The action
pertinent to this causes the generosity etc. that has been performed and accumulated 57
to become inexhaustible through the transformation into universal enlightenment. The
roots of the wholesome which consist in the transformation into universal enlighten-
ment, like universal enlightenment itself, become inexhaustible.
[23] Through the perfection of vows he engages in generosity etc. at all
times while rejoicing in the birth of a Buddha58 in all of his rebirths due
to his possession of favourable births. Because vows have the nature of all
sorts of wishes 59, a vow in this context is considered as being the wish for a rebirth in
keeping with one's wholesome [deeds]. The action pertinent to this is the engagement
in generosity etc. at all times while rejoicing in the birth of a Buddha in each of one's
rebirths.
[24] Through the perfection of strength, he engages eternally in gen-
erosity etc. due to the strength 60 of his critical consideration and medi-
tative development, because he is not overcome by adverse elements.
Critical consideration refers to wisdom; meditative development refers to the practice in
[developing] the wholesome dharmas. Both of these, which cannot be overcome by
adverse elements, are described as the perfection of strength. The action pertinent to
this is the engagement in generosity etc. of necessity every moment, for the word
'eternal' is synonymous with 'perpetual'. Thus the wholesome [deeds] such as
generosity which possesses the strength of critical consideration and meditative devel-
opment are not overcome by the adverse ones61.
[25] Through the perfection of direct intuition, since it removes confu-
sion about the literal meaning of the Dharma, he experiences in return
the enjoyment of the Dharma which has generosity etc. as its control-

ling influence, and he brings beings to maturity. The perfection of direct
intuition is the direct intuition that is devoid of confusion concerning the literal meaning
of all the doctrinal teachings of the universal vehicle. What is this confusion in regard
to the literal meaning? This confusion in regard to literal meaning refers to that
whereby one construes [the meaning] in just the literal sense after rejecting the intended
meaning. The Dharma, i.e. the Sütras etc., which is taught with reference to generos-
ity, i.e. having made generosity the objective support, has generosity as its controlling
influence,. [The Dharma] should be considered in the same way [in regard to the
other perfections] i.e. as having morality, patience and vigour etc. as controlling influ-
ence. The actions pertinent to the perfection of direct intuition are: (a) the experiencing
of the enjoyment of the Dharma and (b) the maturation of beings, through: (a) analyti-
cal discussion [of the Dharma]62 which is free from erroneous inversion concerning
the universal vehicle on the part of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas63 and (b) the bring-
ing of beings to maturity by means of the Dharma teachings that are free from
erroneous inversion because the Dharma instructions, such as the Sutras, are consti-
tuted by the perfection of direct intuition.

b. Spiritual Practice in relation to Mental
Attention.
In the universal vehicle, the continuous mental attention to the
Dharmas, such as the Sutras, as set out with reference to generosity etc.

that consists in: (a) learning, (b) reflection and (c) meditative develop-
ment. Through these three modes of wisdom, what virtue does that
mental attention bring64?

Because of their: (a) superiority and
(b) inexhaustibility.
How can it be due to their: (a) superiority and (b) inexhaustibility?
V.10 d
Because they: (a) assist others and
(b) do not cease.286
They are superior because they are engaged in assisting others.
They are to be known as inexhaustible because they are not appeased,
i.e. do not cease, even in parinirvāpa.
Spiritual practice in relation to mental attention has now been
described.

Y209.12 [1] The spiritual practice in relation to mental attention should be mentioned immedi-

Y210
[The bodhisattva's] mental attention,
in the universal vehicle, to the
Dharmas 65 as set out etc.
The mental attention to the Dharmas such as the Sütras as set out66 with
reference to generosity etc., i.e. with reference to67 generosity, morality, patience,
vigour etc. Herein, (the mental attention to] the Dharmas, such as the Sūtras, mixtures
of prose and verse and also the prophesies taught by the Venerable One with reference
to generosity in whatever mode, which are so devoid of superimposition and negation
as to meaning and word, is the spiritual practice in regard to mental attention;
not anything else. In the universal vehicle, but not in the śrävaka vehicle; for, in
the latter, generosity etc. 68 is taught as being just for one's own benefit and not for the
benefit of oneself as well as others, as in the universal vehicle. Therefore, it is just in
the universal vehicle that the mental attention by the bodhisattvas to the Dharmas, such
as the Sūtras as set out with reference to generosity etc., is the spiritual practice in
regard to mental attention. It is made known that in the śrävaka vehicle the mental
attention to the Sutras etc. that are preached with reference to generosity etc. is a false
spiritual practice in regard to mental attention69 because it has just the benefit of the
individual for its basis. Moreover, for the most part, these [Dharmas of the universal
vehicle] are taught with reference to evenmindedness, non-attachment, lack of arro-
gance and non-perception. Evenmindedness, in this respect, is the wish to assist
equally both those who possess virtues and those who do not. Non-attachment, in this
respect, is the application in regard to generosity etc. that is only for the benefit of
others on the part of one who has no wish for existence and enjoyment. Lack arto-

gance, in this respect, is to not praise oneself nor despise others on account of one's
generosity etc. Non-perception, in this respect, is the purification of the three aspects
[of giving] according to the rule of the non-perception of the gift, the giver and the
recipient. Continuously, i.e. again and again, through the wisdom that
consists in: (a) learning, (b) reflection and (c) meditative development.
Of these, (a) that which consists in learning is the certainty that comes from the authori-

(c) success in one's aim;
The constituent element is the spiritual lineage72, i.e. the 'seed'; its nourishment is
[equivalent to] its augmentation. And, on account of the nourishment of the constituent
element, one becomes possessed of brilliant and extensive wisdom in the future. [The
bodhisattva] whole-heartedly enters into the meaning of what he has
learnt. Through the wisdom that consists in reflection, he resolutely enters into the
true meaning 73 that is not erroneously inverted 74 because this is generated through the
force of reasoning in respect of the meaning of those Dharmas such as the Sūtras that
he has learnt. Through [the wisdom] that consists in meditative develop-
ment, he attains success in his aims. The success in one's aims is [equivalent
to] the understanding of reality. How so? He says: because [such wisdom]
causes the purification for entry to the spiritual levels. For, he enters the
spiritual levels through the purifying [processes] of the applications of mindfulness etc.
Hence it is explained that he enters the spiritual levels only through the applications of
mindfulness etc. Consequently, he attains success in his aims due to the purifying
[processes] that come from the wisdom that consists in the meditative development of
the applications of mindfulness etc. which constitute the entry to the spiritual levels.
What is meant is: he enters the spiritual levels.

[3] Furthermore, this spiritual practice in relation to mental attention is to be known as
being in accompaniment with its accessory elements; it is not in isolation. What are its
accessory elements 75? He says:
V.8 cd
This is to be known as being encompassed by...; what is meant is:
'surrounded by'. The acts of the Dharma are the acts which have the Dharma as their
nature, or else, which have the Dharma as their authority. But since they are not
known, he asks 77: which are the tenfold acts of the Dharma787 Hence he
says:
V.9 a
They are: (a) transcription, (b) ven-
eration, (c) giving79 etc.
Of these, there is: the transcription by oneself or someone else [of the works]
of the universal vehicle either to preserve them for a long time or in order to listen
to them. Its veneration with flowers, incense, lamps80 and perfumes etc. it is the
universal vehicle that is referred to. Having paid respect to it, the giving of the
written works etc. to others81 by one who has entered the universal vehicle. Having
paid respect to it, listening when it is being recited by another. Reading it
oneself with great reverence. Receiving it, i.e. appropriating it oneself with great
faith. Revealing 82, i.e. making known, through great effort, the texts or their
meaning to those who are worthy. Recitation, i.e. the repeated practice of what has
been received. Reflection, i.e. determining the meaning by way of reasoning.
Meditative development, i.e. practice by way of wisdom that has been concen-
trated. The word "and" has the conjunctive sense. Of these, the actions of the body
are demonstrated through the four terms: transcription, veneration, giving and listening.
The actions of speech are demonstrated through the four terms83: reading, receiving84,
revealing and reciting. And the actions of mind are demonstrated through the pair:
reflection and meditative development.

V.10 ab
For, these tenfold acts entail an im-
measurable collection of merit85;
The collection of merit that arises from each particular Dharmic act, i.e. from the
Dharmic acts that are said to be of ten types, cannot be measured either by oneself or
by another because it is far too great. Why is it, when [both vehicles] are equal as
regards explanations of the Dharma in regard to generosity, morality, the meditative
absorptions etc., that in the Sütras, the acts of the Dharma are taught as
having an exorbitantly great result only in the universal vehicle, but in
the Sutras, the acts of the Dharma are not taught in the śrävaka vehicle as having
a great result? For two reasons are the acts of the Dharma taught as having an
exorbitantly great result in the universal vehicle as to which are these two86, he says:
V.10 c
Because of their: (a) superiority and
(b) inexhaustibility;
Since these two are not known, he asks: how can it be due to their: (a) superi-
ority and (b) inexhaustibility? Hence he says:
V.10 d
Because they: (a) assist others and
(b) do not cease.
For, in the universal vehicle, the spiritual practice of the bodhisattva in regard to gen-
erosity etc. is taught as being uniformly instrumental in providing benefit for all
beings87, but its chief object in the śrävaka vehicle is the benefit for oneself. Hence, the
universal vehicle is superior88 to the śrävaka vehicle because it is engaged in
assisting others. Thus, when one states the motive [for its practice], the universal
vehicle is superior in comparison with the śrävaka vehicle. Its inexhaustibility is
due to the manifestation of an inconceivable result of the accumulation of merit and
penetrating insight which: (a) is incorporated in the three [Buddha] Bodies, (b) is
engaged in deeds of welfare for beings for as long as the world exists, (c) is not
appeased even in the nirvāṇa realm that is devoid of the remnants of existence and (d)
is characterized by the turning about of the basis. However, this is not so in the case of
the śrävaka vehicle, for the result of the accumulations of the śrävaka is said to be
exhaustible because it is severed completely on the part of those who have attained the
nirvāṇa devoid of the remnants of existence. Thus, in respect of nirvana too, the
universal vehicle is superior to the śrävaka vehicle because of the manifestation of a
result that does not cease89.

[5] Alternatively, the aim of the universal vehicle which consists in generosity etc. is
devoted to the assistance of all beings; however, the aim of the śrävaka vehicle is not
the same since it is intent upon benefit for oneself. Moreover, the bodhisattvas'
dharmas, such as generosity, which are brought about owing to the purity of their
bodies, are not interrupted even in parinirvāṇa. However, because of the analogy of
the path of the śrāvaka as a raft⁹0, [the dharmas] are completely eradicated in
parinirvăņa, thus they are not inexhaustible. Therefore, it is appropriate that the
Dharmic acts provide a great result only in the universal vehicle and not in the śrāvaka
vehicle.

c. Spiritual Practice that Conforms with the
Dharma
Which is the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma?
V.11 ab
Spiritual practice that conforms with
the Dharma is that which becomes
free from: (i) distraction and (ii)
erroneous inversion;
These are
the twofold spiritual practices that conform with the
Dharma, namely, (i) that which becomes free from distraction and (ii)
that which becomes free from erroneous inversion.
[Sthiramati]
213.22 [1] The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma should be mentioned imme-
diately after the spiritual practice in relation to mental attention, consequently, he asks:
which is the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma? Hence it

Spiritual practice that conforms with

the meditative development of tranquillization and penetrating insight 92 that have been
entered into. Of these, that which becomes free from distraction consists in
the meditative development of tranquillization and that which becomes free from
erroneous inversion consists in the meditative development of penetrating insight.
These are the twofold spiritual practices that conform with the Dharma.
That which becomes Free from Distraction.
The freedom from distraction in this regard is due to the absence of
six types of distraction. These six types of distraction are: (a) innate
distraction, (b) external distraction, (c) internal distraction, (d) the dis-
traction of signs, (e) distraction consisting in disquiet and (f) distrac-
tion to mental attention. How should the characteristic of each of these
be understood? He says:
V.11 cd & 12 abcd
(a) Emergence, (b) dispersal towards
sense objects, (c) relishment, indo-
lence and excitability 93, (d) the ten-
dency to [self] esteem, (e) 'I-notion'
with mental attention and (f) an infer-
ior mentality these are the distrac-
tions to be clearly comprehended by
one who possesses intelligence.
Thus are the characteristics of the six types of distraction that
should be clearly comprehended by the bodhisattva. Of these, (a)
innate distraction refers to one's emergence from meditative develop-
ment through the groups of the five consciousnesses. (b) External
distraction refers to the dispersal towards a sense-object. (c) Internal
distraction refers to the relishing of meditative concentration and indo-
lence and excitability. (d) The distraction of the 'sign' refers to the
intention for [self] esteem, having created this 'sign' through applica-
tion. (e) Distraction that consists in disquiet refers to the mental atten-
tiveness accompanied by 'I-notion' because pride manifests through the
force of disquiet. (f) Distraction to mental attention refers to the
inferior mentality because of the manifestation of the mental attention of
the inferior vehicle.

214.7 [1] Since this prefix 'a' occurs in many senses, it is not known as to which of these [is
applicable] in the term "freedom from distraction" (a-vikṣepa), hence he says: the
freedom from distraction in this regard is due to the absence of six
types of distraction. And since it is not known as to how distraction can be six-
fold, he says: these six types of distraction are: (a) innate distraction, (b)
external distraction etc. 94 etc. Although this is so, distraction has only been
shown by way of its differentiation but not by way of its essential nature, thus he asks:
how should the characteristic of each of these six types of distraction be
understood?⁹5 Hence he says:
V.11 c

nesses.
The expression: "by one who possesses intelligence" [means] the intelligent one, i.e.
the bodhisattva. Of these, one's emergence from meditative concentration
through the groups of the five consciousnesses...; for, when one of any of
the five consciousnesses, such as sight, arise in one who is meditatively concentrated,
he has then emerged from meditative concentration this is innate distraction
because it is occupied with externals. The emergence from meditative concentration
through the groups of the five consciousnesses is described as innate distraction
because it consists in the distraction that pertains to the groups of the five conscious-
292
(a) Emergence, (b) dispersal towards
a sense-object etc.
[2] External distraction refers to the dispersal⁹6 towards a sense-object.
Some believe that when the mind-consciousness of one who is meditatively concen-
trated moves unintentionally away from the meditative objective to another objective
support it is external distraction because [consciousness] transfers to the other objec-
tive support. Others believe that when one who is meditatively concentrated relin-
quishes the meditative objective, the transference to another sense-object by mind-
consciousness is external distraction.
94
95
[3] Internal distraction refers to the relishing of meditative concentra-
tion, and indolence and excitability. If one who is concentrated relishes a
particular meditative concentration on account of moral defilement, such as craving, he
becomes distracted from that pure meditative concentration due to the proximity of
defiled concentration. Also, he is distracted from that meditative concentration wherein
tranquillization and penetrating insight are brought together on account of indolence

and excitability 97. Since relishment, indolence and excitability are impairments for one
who is concentrated 98, relishing etc. are described as internal distractions.
[4] The distraction of the 'sign' refers to the intention for [self] esteem.
A meditator may consider himself a great being and thus holds himself in esteem; on
account of this 'sign' on the part of one who has applied himself to meditative concen-
tration there is distraction from the wholesome side, whether it has been obtained or
not, due to the waning away of his [original] aspiration this is described as the
distraction of the 'sign'. Here now he provides the reason: having created this
'sign' through application. Having created the 'sign', i.e. that intention for [self]
esteem on account of the desire for a reputation for skill99, thinking that [thereby],
because he has applied himself to meditative concentration, there would be esteem for
himself.
[5] The distraction that consists in disquiet refers to mental attentive-
ness accompanied by 'I-notion'. Even while resolutely seeking the virtues of
meditative concentration one who possesses mental attention, accompanied by I-
notion 100, is associated with pride insofar as he may consider himself to be a meditator
- and as a consequence of this he exalts himself and holds others in contempt. Why
does this mental attention consist in disquiet? Hence he says: because pride mani-
fests through the force of disquiet. This is what is being said: distraction that
is characterized by disquiet is [described as] the distraction that consists in disquiet¹01.
But what is disquiet? It is the full maturation of the latent impressions of pride since
pride manifest on account of it; thus [it is said]: "because pride manifests through the
force of that [i.e. disquiet]". Others believe that disquiet refers to the false view of
individuality.

account of: (a) the fear of the sufferings of samsāra, (b) acting wrongly towards sen-
tient beings and (c) being in company with people who are not good spiritual friends,
the śrāvaka pratyekabuddha mentality arises in one who has applied himself to the
mental attention of the universal vehicle but whose spiritual lineage as a śråvaka etc. is
not determined. This is the inferior mentality because it has merely the benefit for one-

self as its main object. This śrävaka and pratyekabuddha mentality is described 102 as a
distraction to mental attention since it is a distraction to the mental attention of the
universal vehicle. Here now he provides the reason: because of the manifestation
of the mental attention of the inferior vehicle103. The inferior vehicle refers
to the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha vehicles. The manifestation of this mental attention
distracts one from the mental attention of the universal vehicle because it is essentially
occupied with [attainment of] parinirvāṇa for oneself - thus it is said that the distraction
to mental attention refers to inferior mentality. Thus this absence of the faults of the six
types of distraction on the part of the bodhisattva is to be known as the meditative
development of tranquillization 104.
That which Becomes Free from Erroneous Inversion.
Therein, the absence of erroneous inversion is to be known in rela-
tion to ten kinds of entities, namely:
V.13 abcd
In regard to these:
V.14 abcd
(a) Syllables, (b) object, (c) mental
activity, (d) non-dispersal, (e) & (f)
the dual characteristics, (g) lack of
purity and purity, (h) what is adven-
titious, (i) absence of fear and (j)
absence of arrogance.
The object both exists and does not
exist (a) because of combination and
familiarity and (b) because of sepa-
ration and lack of familiarity this is
the absence of erroneous inversion
in relation to syllables.
When there is a combination of syllables as an uninterrupted articu-
lation, they have significance due to familiarity inasmuch as one thinks:
"this is the name of that". In the contrary case, they are devoid of
significance. Seeing that this is so is to be known as the absence of

erroneous inversion in relation to the object?
V.15 abcd
295
What is the absence of
It appears as the duality but is non-
existent as such this is the absence
of erroneous inversion in relation to
the object and is devoid of existence
and non-existence.
It appears as the duality, i.e. as apprehended object and apprehend-
ing subject, since it arises in the aspect of these [two] although it does
not exist as such, i.e. in the way in which it appears. Seeing this in
regard to the object is [equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inver-
sion in relation to it. The object is devoid of existence because of the
non-existence of both apprehended object and apprehending subject; it
is devoid of non-existence because of the real existence of its erroneous
appearance as that [duality].
V.16 abcd
Mental activity that consists in talk
is developed by that [dualistic] talk
and is the basis for it this is the
absence of erroneous inversion in
relation to mental activity which is
the ground for the manifestation of
the duality.
-
Mental activity that consists in talk is fully developed by talk that
pertains to the apprehended object and apprehending subject and is the
basis for that conceptual differentiation of the apprehended object and
apprehending subject. Thus, this is [equivalent to the absence of erro-
neous inversion in relation to mental activity. In relation to which
mental activity? In relation to that which forms the ground for the
manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject. For,
this mental activity that consists in talk is to be known as the basis for
the conceptual differentiation of apprehended object and apprehending
subject because it is fully developed by verbal notions.
V.17 abcd
The existence and non-existence of
the object is considered like a magi-
cal creation etc. this is the absence
of erroneous inversion in relation to
non-diffusion because [mind] does№67
V.18 abc
not disperse towards existence or
non-existence.
That which was just described as the existence or non-existence of
the object is considered like a magical creation etc. In the same way
that a magical creation neither exists as an entity such as an elephant,
nor is it non-existent because it exists as 'bare' error; so too does the
object neither exist in the way in which it manifests, i.e. as the appre-
hended object and apprehending subject, nor is it non-existent because
it exists as 'bare' error. By the word "etc.", similes such as mirages,
dreams and the reflection of the moon on water are to be understood as
is appropriate. That which sees the non-dispersal of mind in this way,
since it sees in the object its resemblance to a magical creation etc., is
[equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-
dispersal because the non-dispersal of mind towards existent or non-
existent entities is on account of it.
The fact that everything is name-only
is for the non-engagement in all con-
ceptual differentiation this is the
absence of erroneous inversion in
relation to the individual charac-
teristic;
V.18 d
296
All this is name-only, i.e. that which comprises [the sense-fields of]
sight/form up until mind/non-sensibles knowing that this is so [acts]
as the counteragent to all conceptual differentiation. This is [equivalent
to] the absence of conceptual differentiation in relation to the individual
characteristic. In relation to which individual characteristic?
In relation to the individual charac-
teristic in an ultimate sense.
However, the notion that this is name-only in a conventional sense,
is not accepted.
V.19 abcd
Since no dharma is to be found out-
side the dharmadhatu, therefore the
latter is the universal characteristic
this is the absence of erroneous in-
version in relation to that.
Since no dharma whatsoever is to be found that is exempt from the
insubstantiality of the dharmas, therefore, the dharmadhātu is the uni-№68
297
versal characteristic of all the dharmas knowing that this is so is
[equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
universal characteristic.
V.20 abcd
The lack of purity on the part of that
[i.e. the dharmadhatu] and its purity
are due to the non-relinquishment
and relinquishment of erroneously
inverted mental activity this is the
absence of erroneous inversion in
relation to that.
A lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the non-
relinquishment of erroneously inverted mental activity; purity [on its
behalf] refers to the relinquishment of that knowing that this is so is
[equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack
of purity and purity, respectively.
V.21 abcd
This pair is adventitious, for, the
dharmadhātu is pure by nature, like
space, this is the absence of erro-
neous inversion in relation to that.
Moreover, because the dharmadhātu is pure by nature, like space,
the pair, i.e. its lack of purity and subsequent purity, is adventitious;
knowing that this is so is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous
inversion in relation to its adventitious nature.
V.22 abcd
Defilement and purity do not belong
to the dharmas nor to the personal
entity because they do not exist,
hence, there is neither fear nor
arrogance this is the absence of
erroneous inversion in relation to
that.
There is no defilement nor purity on the part of the personal entity
nor the dharmas because neither the personal entity exists nor do the
dharmas. Consequently, there is no defilement nor purification of any-
one whatsoever. Hence, concerning the side of defilement, there is no
deficiency on the part of anyone and concerning the side of purification,
there is no excellence on the part of anyone on account of which fear
and arrogance [respectively] would result. This is [equivalent to] the216.15
Y217
298
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of
arrogance.
[Sthiramati]
[1] Thus, the manner in which the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma
and which becomes free from erroneous inversion is to be cultivated by one who is
devoid of distraction is now described. That which becomes free from erroneous
inversion is that which arises in the nature of the absence of erroneous inversion. The
absence of erroneous inversion in this regard refers to the knowledge of an entity
exactly as it is. Now, in how many types of entity does such an entity consist? Since
this is not known, he says: therein, the absence of erroneous inversion is to
be known in relation to ten types of entity; in order to demonstrate those
entities that are free from erroneous inversion, he says: namely:
V.13 ab
(a) Syllables, (b) object, (c) mental
activity, (d) non-dispersal, (e) the
dual characteristics etc.
Now, in order to demonstrate the way in which the absence of erroneous inversion
relates to these entities, he says: in regard to these:
V.14 abcd
The object both exists and does not
exist, (a) because of combination and
familiarity 105 and (b) because of sepa-
ration and lack of familiarity 106 this
is the absence of erroneous inversion
in relation to syllables.
When there is a combination of syllables...; "combination" refers to the close
contact of one with another and this is not found on the part of [spoken] syllables
because they cannot co-exist since the simultaneous articulation of syllables is not logi-
cally tenable. order to dispel the uncertainty that a preceding articulation 107 does not
remain 108
at the time that subsequent syllables are articulated because they pass away
immediately after they are articulated, he says: as an uninterrupted articulation.
This is what is being said: an articulation that is not erroneously inverted or sluggish is
considered in this regard as a combination of syllables, but the close contact of sylla-
bles, one with another, is not. Due to familiarity 109, inasmuch as one thinks:
"this is the name of that"; i.e. when conventional symbols are learnt by heart, one
thinks: "this is the name of that entity", thus, through these two modes [i.e. combina-

tion and familiarity] they have significance. what is meant is: the syllabies are
understood. In the contrary case, they are devoid of significancel10; the
contrary case refers to the absence of both, or the lack of one of the two. Seeing that
this is so, i.e. the knowledge [that this is so], is to be known as the absence of
erroneous inversion in relation to syllables in a conventional sense but not in
an ultimate sense because the absence of erroneous inversion in an ultimate sense is
devoid of conceptual differentiation111. Thus, through this absence of erroneous inver-
sion, the bodhisattva penetrates all dharmas free from the meaning of words [i.e. he
understands without concepts (vikalpa) expressed in words (sabda)].
[2] Now in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in rela-
tion to the object which is the cause for its designation by means of syllables, he
says:
V.15 ab
It appears as the duality but is non-
existent as such etc.
It appears as the duality, i.e. as apprehended object and apprehending
subject. What does? The other-dependent nature. Why? Because it possesses the
'seed' of the apprehended object and apprehending subject. But what is the meaning of
"appears" in this context? Hence he says: since it arises in the aspect of these
[two]; i.e. it appears as the apprehended object and apprehending subject because it
arises in the aspect of apprehended object and apprehending subject; but this is not due
to the influence of an adjunct, like a crystal. "But is non-existent as such", although
it does not exist as such, i.e. in the way, or in the aspect, in which it
appears¹12 because it is non-dual by nature. Seeing this in regard to the
object, as it is the cause for the arising of the erroneous consciousness, is
[equivalent to] the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to it. The
intended meaning is that it avoids [the extremes of] existence and non-existence. The
object is devoid of existence; here now he provides the reason: because of the
non-existence of both apprehended object and apprehending subject 13,
The existence of the object [implies] the real existence of apprehended object and
apprehending subject; [the object] is devoid of that because it is empty of the aspect of

what is the reason? Because of the real existence of the erroneous appear-
ance as that [duality]. What is meant is: because of the real existence of the erro-
neous appearance as apprehended object and apprehending subject. And this is said to
be an absence of erroneous inversion in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate

sense because it is accompanied by conceptual differentiation. Through this know-
ledge free from erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva penetrates all dharmas as being
devoid of the essential nature of apprehended object and apprehending subject.
[3] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
store-consciousness which is the cause for the manifestation¹14 of the apprehended
object and apprehending subject¹15, he says:
V.16 ab
Mental activity that consists in talk
is developed by that [dualistic] talk
and is the basis for it etc.
Mental activity that consists in talk is fully developed by talk that
pertains to the apprehended object and apprehending subject 16. With
regard to the object that has the characteristic of the manifestation of the apprehended
object and apprehending subject, one has the thought: "that is the object and this is the
subject" such a spoken or mental utterance is described as "talk". What is fully
developed by this talk is described as "developed" since it causes the maturation of the
'seed' for the production of talk of the same genre in the future. It is called the mental
activity that consists in talk because it is fully developed by talk, for the cause is figu-
ratively expressed in the sense of the effect [which it produces]. However, in this
context, talk refers to the latent impressions of talk since talk exists in those
[impressions] considering that there is no differentiation between the support and that
to be supported [i.e. talk and mental activity]. Alternatively, because there is no
mention of the word "support" [i.e. one is not the support of the other], one speaks of
mental activity that consists in talk since it is the support for the 'seed' of the con-
ceptual differentiation117 of apprehended object and apprehending
subject which is called "talk"118. Furthermore, it is the basis for talk that arises in
dependence upon the latter, thus, this is [equivalent to] the absence of erro-
neous inversion in relation to mental activity. What is meant is: the know-
ledge that is not erroneously inverted. But this mental activity, in relation to which
there is an absence of erroneous inversion, is not known, hence he asks: in relation
to which 19 mental activity is there an absence of erroneous inversion? Hence, in
order to specify that mental activity, he says: in relation to that which forms the
ground for the manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehend-
ing subject. What is meant is: it consists in a special aspect of the store-conscious-
ness. In order to demonstrate the way in which the latter forms the ground for the

manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject, he says: for, this
the mental activity that consists in talk... because it is fully developed
by verbal notions. It is the fact that it [i.e. the store-consciousness] forms the
ground for the manifestation of the apprehended object and apprehending subject that
is referred to. Alternatively, as to mental activity that consists in talk, in order to
demonstrate that this causes one's engagement in verbal notions, he has said ¹20: "it is
described as mental activity that consists in talk because it is fully developed by verbal
notions". Verbal notions refer to notions that arise from speech, or which cause the
arising of speech. It is on account of these [notions] together with their associated
elements, that the mental activity consisting in talk is described as "fully developed",
because they cause the maturation of the individual 'seeds' in the mental activity that
consists in talk. This too is an absence of erroneous inversion just in a conventional
sense but not in an ultimate sense. Moreover, through this absence of erroneous inver-
sion, the bodhisattva avoids the underlying cause of erroneous inversion which is
characterized by notional attachment to the apprehended object and apprehending
subject and in this way disquiet is easily avoided ¹21.
[4] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to
non-dispersal, he says:
V.17 ab
That which was just described as the existence or non-existence of the
object... How was it just described? [As the following]:
It appears as the duality but is non-existent
as such this is the absence of erroneous
inversion in relation to the object¹22 and is de-
void of existence and non-existence. [V.15]
The existence and non-existence of
the object is considered like a magi-
cal creation etc.
It is considered like a magical creation etc. "Like a magical creation etc."
[means]: like entities that are magical creations etc. In order to demonstrate just this, he
says: in the same way that a magical creation neither exists as an entity
such as an elephant, since it manifests in the nature of an elephant etc. which is
non-existent in itself123. Although it is said that it does not exist as an entity such as an
elephant, it is not non-existent in every respect on the contrary 124: nor is it non-

existent because it exists as 'bare' error¹25, It is not non-existent in every
respect because of the existence of that 'bare' error that manifests in the aspect of an
elephant etc. So too does the object neither exist in the way in which it
manifests, i.e. as apprehended object and apprehending subject, nor is it
non-existent because of the existence of that 'bare' error which manifests as
such in the essential nature126 of the mind and the mental concomitants that pertain to
the three realms of existence ¹27. By the word "etc.", similes such as mirages,
dreams and the reflection of the moon on water etc. are to be under-
stood, as is appropriate. For the mirages, dreams and reflections of the moon on
water etc. 128 neither exist in the way in which they appear in the nature of water, men
and women¹29, nor indeed do they not exist ¹30 because of the existence of 'bare' error.
In detail, [the statement]: "so too does the object..." is to be connected with each
[simile]. Moreover, by the word "etc." in this context131, cities of Gandharvas and
echoes etc. are to be understood. That which sees in this way, without distrac-
tion, the non-dispersal of mind towards the sides of existence and non-existence,
because it sees in the object its resemblance 132 to a magical creation
etc. 133, is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversión in relation
to non-dispersal. But what is non-dispersal? Some believe that it consists in the
meditative concentration of the middle way134. If this is so, how can there be an
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dispersal? Hence he says: because
the non-dispersal of mind¹35 toward existent or non-existent entities is
on account of it. Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva is

not distracted from the objective support for [the realization of] emptiness because of
the absence of conceptual differentiation in regard to existence and non-existence136.
Therefore, it is described as the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dis-
persal 137. And this is an absence of erroneous inversion in just a conventional sense,
but not in an ultimate sense, for the latter is devoid of conceptual differentiation.
[5] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
individual characteristic, he says:
V.18 ab
The fact that everything is name-only
is for the non-engagement in all con-
ceptual differentiation 138 etc.
All this is name-only, i.e. that which¹39 comprises [the sense-fields of]
sight/form up until mind/non-sensibles hence all that comprises the twelve
sense-fields is to be known as name-only. The designation, in this respect, comprises
the own-being and the particulars of the name; also, the own-being of either the object
to be designated or the designation does not exist because: (a) it is imaginatively con-
structed in such a nature and (b) what is imaginatively constructed does not exist.
Otherwise, apprehending would take place through sight etc. 140 regardless of the name,
yet there can be no apprehending141 of a conventional symbol that is not known.
Therefore, because that object implied by the terms sight/form etc. does not have the
own-being of that [sight/form], [the sense-fields of sight/form up until mind/non-
sensibles are indeed name-only, [hence] knowing that this is so [acts] as the
counteragent to all conceptual differentiation 142. This is [equivalent to]
the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual charac-
teristic. One engages in all conceptual differentiation in regard to all dharmas by
way of imaginary dharmas¹43. Hence, the knowledge which penetrates [the realization
that all is] name-only and which is the counteragent to all conceptual differentiation, is
described as the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual character-
istic. However, it is not known in this regard whether the latter refers to the individual
characteristic in an ultimate sense or in a conventional sense, consequently he asks: in

relation to which individual characteristic? Hence he says that this absence of
erroneous inversion is:
V.18 d
In relation to the individual charac-
teristic in an ultimate sense.
Because the individual characteristic, in an ultimate sense, is inexpressible but not so in
a conventional sense. What is the reason? Because the notion that this is name-
only in a conventional sense, is not accepted144; for, imaginative construc-
tions 145 arise in relation to the essential nature of a dharma through speech; however,
this is just in a conventional sense and not in an ultimate sense because it is the process
of conceptual differentiation that recognizes that it is name-only. Through this absence
of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva becomes skilled in both the conventional and
the ultimate.
[6] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
universal characteristic, he says:
V.19 ab
Since no dharma is to be found out-
side the dharmadhātu¹46 etc.
For, no dharma whatsoever whether material or non-material is to be found
that is exempt from the insubstantiality of the dharmas, because all
dharmas are inexpressible and non-dual¹47 by nature since they are devoid of the rela-
tion of apprehended object and apprehending subject. Therefore, the dharma-
dhātu is the universal characteristic of all dharmas; it is described as the
universal characteristic of [all] these existing [dharmas]148 as it is not different in all
dharmas. Knowing that this is so is [equivalent to] the absence of erro-
neous inversion in relation to the universal characteristic¹49; i.e. in a
conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense because the latter is devoid of concep-
tual differentiation. Through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva
becomes skilled in the objective support of purity because it is the object of direct
intuition free from conceptual differentiation.
[7] How does one distinguish between the universal characteristic and the individual
characteristic? The characteristic in the ultimate sense150 lefers to the inexpressible
essential nature [which acts] as the counteragent¹51 to the superimposed essential

nature [expressed] in speech. Furthermore, the universal characteristic refers to the
insubstantial imaginary nature which is innate to all dharmas. Thus, this distinction is
in accord with a difference in perspectives but is not due to the object.
[8] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
lack of purity or the purity on the part of the dharmadhātu, he says:
V.20 bc
...Are due to the non-relinquishment
and relinquishment of erroneously
inverted 152 mental activity etc.
A lack of purity 153 on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the non-
relinquishment of erroneously inverted 154 mental activity; the purity [on
its behalf] refers to the relinquishment of that. In this respect, erroneously
inverted 155 mental activity is conceptual differentiation that consists in erroneous inver-
sion and is the ground of the store-consciousness. The lack of purity on the part of the
dharmadhatu refers to the non-relinquishment of the latter 156; purity [on its behalf]
refers to its relinquishment. Knowing that this is so is [equivalent to] the
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of purity and
purity, respectively. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of
purity on the part of the dharmadhatu refers to the fact that the non-relinquishment of
erroneously inverted 157 mental activity is [equivalent to] the lack of purity on the part
of the dharmadhātu. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to its purity refers
to the fact that its relinquishment is [equivalent to] purity [on its behalf]. What is the
reason? Because the dharmadhatu is defiled by adventitious secondary defilement.
This too is an absence of erroneous inversion only in a conventional sense but not in
an ultimate sense; and, through this absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattva
clearly comprehends: (a) the obscuration to the dharmadhātu that has not been relin-
quished and (b) that which has been relinquished.
[9] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
adventitious nature of both the lack of purity and the purity on the part of the dharma-
dhātu, he says:
V.21 ab
...For, the dharmadhitu is pure by
nature, like space etc.
Moreover, because the dharmadhatu is pure by nature, like space, this
pair, i.e. its lack of purity and subsequent purity 158, is adventitious. The

306
lack of purity on the part of the dharmadhātu is mentioned in this regard because it is
[superficially] defiled by unreal conceptual differentiation; its purity [is mentioned]
because one subsequently relinquishes that [secondary defilement] through the arising
of the counteragent and both of these are adventitious to the dharmadhātu. What is the
reason? Because the innate purity of the dharmadhātu is like that of space.
[Objection]: A lack of purity on the part of what is pure by nature may be adventitious,
but, since its purity is an eternal purity, how can it be adventitious? [Response]: This
fault is not [applicable] since, in this context, this purity is intended 159 as an absence of
stain; only because of this is it stated that its purity is subsequent. Knowing that
this is so in regard to the dharmadhătu¹60 is [equivalent to the absence of
erroneous inversion in relation to the adventitious nature of both the lack
of purity and the purity on the part of the dharmadhătu. This too is [an absence of
erroneous inversion] in a conventional sense but not in an ultimate sense. Through this
absence of erroneous inversion, the bodhisattval61 clearly comprehends the fabricated
nature162 of the states of defilement and purification in regard to the dharmadhātu..
[10] Now, in order to demonstrate the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
lack of fear and lack of arrogance, he says:
V.22 ab
Defilement and purity do not belong
to the dharmas nor to the personal
entity etc.
There is no defilement nor purity on the part of the personal entity 163
nor the dharmas; [the words]: "defilement and purity" remain in force in regard to
the latter [i.e. the dharmas]. Here now he provides the reason: because neither the
personal entity exists, nor do the dharmas; [the word] "exists" remains in
force in regard to the latter¹64. At the time of the states of defilement and purifi-
cation 165, if [an entity] exists separately from defilement and purification it would be
tenable to imagine that it can possess defilement or purification, and diminution and
increase 166 would also exist separately from that [entity]. [However], there is no
personal entity such as that because it is not an object of direct perception or inference.
Also, the dharmas which possess an imaginary nature are certainly non-existent

because numerous imaginative constructions arise in regard to the one entity, and it is
not tenable that the one [entity] can have numerous natures. Consequently, because
both the personal entity and the dharmas are non-existent, like the son of an infertile
woman etc., there is no defilement or purification; the possession of defilement
and purity is not
epted 167
even on the part of the other-dependent [nature] which is
the sphere of pure mundane direct intuition. For what reason? Because it is inex-
pressible and non-dual by nature. [Objection]: If [defilement and purity] are not even
accepted 168 as belonging to the other-dependent [nature], to which [nature] would they
belong for the effort directed towards the relinquishment of defilement and the acquisi-
tion of purity169 would be in vain if they [i.e. defilement and purity] did not exist?
[Response]: This fault is not [applicable] since defilement and purity belong to the
dharmadhātu, [or rather] although they are respectively determined as belonging to the
dharmadhātu, they are certainly not identical with it because they are both adventitious
to the dharmadhatu 170 and, like space, the dharmadhātu does not change. Hence,
concerning the side of defilement, there is no deficiency whatsoever and
concerning the side of purification, there is no excellence whatsoever¹71
on account of which fear or arrogance [respectively] would result. This
is [equivalent to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
lack of fear and the lack of arrogance.
[11] However, others say that in regard to the side of defilement, there is no deficiency
on the part of anyone and in regard to the side of purification, there is no excellence172
because there is no one who possesses both of these. Since the two do not exist in this
way 173, how, in this respect, can one either fear that: "this is not mine", or have the
prideful notion that: "this174 excellence belongs to me"?
[12] Others again believe that in the first place the personal entity does not exist and a
dharma which experiences the two states and to which the two are imagined to belong
also does not exist. On the contrary, this defilement and purification is none other than
dependent origination.
[13] This too is [intended] in the conventional but not in the absolute sense!

the latter is devoid of conceptual differentiation. Through this absence of erroneous
inversion, [the bodhisattva] penetrates the unchanging nature of the dharmadhātu
because of the absence of decay and growth ¹76.
[14] Others believe that [the bodhisattva] goes forth free from obscuration after
having relinquished all obscuration through this absence of erroneous inversion.
Alternatively, the absence of erroneous inversion in an absolute sense is indicated here
by way of the tenfold absences of erroneous inversion which consist in the conven-
tional 177, since it is not possible to explain it in any other way. Others say that these
absences of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables, object, mental activity, non-
dispersal, individual characteristic, universal characteristic, lack of purity, purity, what
is adventitious, lack of fear and lack of arrogance also refer to the three natures 178. Of
these, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables and object refer to the
imaginary nature because both [the notions of] combination and object that has 'fallen'
into duality are imaginary. Although they do not have a reality for their object, these
two do consist in an absence of erroneous inversion since they are without erroneous
inversion as such in this way. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental
activity 179 refers to the other-dependent nature because the mental activity that consists
in talk is intrinsic to the nature of the store-consciousness. The absence of erroneous
inversion ¹80 in relation to non-dispersal181 refers to the perfected nature. Why?
Because: (a) direct intuition that is devoid of conceptual differentiation is not distracted
[by conjecture] about existent or non-existent [entities] and (b) the latter is incorporated
in the perfected nature since it is perfection as an absence of erroneous inversion182.
The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual and universal charac-
teristics refers just to the dharmadhatu because the essential nature of the latter tran-
scends the sphere of conceptual differentiation. The absence of erroneous inversion in
relation to both the lack of purity and purity refers to a special state of the dharma-
dhātu. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to what is adventitious refers to
that same dharmadhātu; for it is due to the mental defilement and the mental purity of
that which, like space, is pure by nature that the two [purity and its lack] are respec-
tively determined as adventitious. The absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the

lack of fear and the lack of arrogance refers also to the dharmadhātu because of the
unfabricated nature of the latter, for, like space, it is devoid of deficiency and
excellence. These tenfold absences of erroneous inversion are to be understood in this
way in relation to the three natures.
The Ten Vajra Words
Furthermore, these ton absences of erroneous inversion are to be
connected respectively with the ten vajra words. The ten vajra words
are: (i) existerce and non-existence, (ii) the absence of erroneous inver-
sion, (iii) the basis, (iv) the resemblance to a magical creation, (v) the
absence of conceptual differentiation, (vi) intrinsic luminosity, (vii)
defilement and purification, (viii) the resemblance to space, (ix) non-
deficiency and (x) non-excellence.
The 'body' of the vajra words is established by way of: (a) own-
being, (b) objective support, (c) absence of conceptual differentiation
and (d) objections and refutations. Of these, (a) "by way of own-
being" refers to the three natures called 'perfected', 'imaginary' and
'other-dependent' corresponding respectively with the first three [vajra]
words, 183
(b) "By way of objective support" refers to these same
[three] natures. (c) "By way of the absence of conceptual differen-
tiation" refers to: (i) that on account of which one does not conceptually
differentiate, i.e. direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation,
and (ii) that which does not perform conceptual differentiation in regard
to intrinsic luminosity. Then, by means of these, the establishment of
both the object of knowledge and the act of knowing is to be under-
stood respectively, namely, through the three natures and the absence of
conceptual differentiation. (d) "By way of objections and refutations"
refers to the remaining [vajra] words. This is the objection in this
regard: "If these dharmas which are characterized by the imaginary and
the other-dependent [natures] are non-existent, how can they be per-
ceived? On the other hand if they do exist, the intrinsic luminosity of
the dharmas is not tenable." One refutes this through their resemblance
to a magical creation, i.e. on the grounds that what comprises a magical
creation does not exist yet it is perceived. [An objection]: "If the
dharmas possess intrinsic luminosity, how can they be defiled initially
183
The Tib. Bhaşya appears confused in this area and inserts the first of the three antaraśloka here,
whereas in the Sanskrit Bhäşya all three are found at the end of this section.Y227
and subsequently purified?" Its refutation: Defilement and purification
are to be understood according to their resemblance to space, i.e. on the
grounds that space, which is pure by nature, can be defiled and then
purified. [An objection]: "If there is the removal of the moral defile-
ment184 of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings when immeasurable
numbers of Buddhas are born, how is it that samsāra is not eradicated
and nirvana is not augmented?" Its refutation is on the grounds of non-
deficiency and non-excellence, because the realms of sentient beings
and 'sides' to purification are immeasurable.
Secondly, the 'body' is established as follows:
(a) Wherein, whatever and whence is
error and (b) wherein and whatever
is non-error and indeed (c) the re-
sults of both error and non-error and
(d) the end of these two.

lence;
These are the ten vajra words.
The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma has now been
described.
[Sthiramati]
7226.14 [1] These ten absences of erroneous inversion that have just been described
are to be connected respectively with the ten vajra words described in the
Sūtras. Which are the ten vajra words? They are: (i) existence and non-
existence, (ii) the absence of erroneous inversion, (iii) the basis, (iv)
the resemblance to a magical creation, (v) the absence of conceptual
Read: klesapagamaḥ in place of klesapasamaḥ; Tib. kun nas ñon mons pa bsal na (D23b.4).

differentiation185, (vi) intrinsic luminosity186, (vii) defilement and
purification ¹87, (viii) the resemblance to space, (ix) non-deficiency and
(x) non-excellence. These are [of the nature of] a vajra because: (a) like a vajra,
they penetrate all erroneous inversion and (b) the former cannot be penetrated by the
latter. This is [equivalent to] the knowledge of the absence of erroneous inversion that
has just been described [in the last section]. And since this 188 vajra[-like knowledge]
is illustrated, i.e. is made known, through them, they are [described as] the vajra
words; what is meant is: vajra-like explanations. Furthermore, it is [the ten words of
the previous section] beginning with "syllable", "object" and "mental activity" that are
signified by the term "word". Consequently, "words of the vajra" means: 'objective
supports of the vajra; alternatively, these words are described as vajra words because,
like a vajra, they are difficult to split189. The vajra words are specifically mentioned in
this context because the absences of erroneous inversion must be connected with the
Sutras. Alternatively, it is to demonstrate that this explanation of the vajra words is
through the ten kinds of absence of erroneous inversion. Of these, (a) the existence or
non-existence of the meaning of syllables is [equivalent to the vajra word] "existence
and non-existence"; hence, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to syllables is
to be known as referring to "existence and non-existence" [listed] among the vajra
words. (b) The appearance as the duality which is imaginary refers to the "object" in
this context and the [knowledge] that it is non-existent as such refers to the absence of
erroneous inversion in this regard. Thus, the absence of erroneous inversion in rela-
tion to the object is to be connected with the "absence of erroneous inversion" [listed]
among the vajra words. (c) Since that same mental activity that consists in talk is a
'basis' in this context, the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activity is
to be connected with the "basis" (listed] among the vajra words. (d) The absence of
erroneous inversion in relation to the non-dispersal of mind, since [it sees in the object]
its resemblance to a magical creation etc, 190, is to be connected with the "resemblance
to a magical creation" [listed] among the vajra words 191. (e) It is that same individual
characteristic of the dharmadhātu that is [equivalent to the absence of conceptual
differentiation since it is devoid of imaginative constructions; therefore, the absence of
erroneous inversion in relation to the individual characteristic is to be regarded as the

"absence of conceptual differentiation" 192, (f) The universal193 [characteristic] of the
dharmadhātu refers to its intrinsic luminosity; therefore, the absence of erroneous
inversion in relation to the universal characteristic is included as "intrinsic luminosity".
(g) Since a special lack of purity194 and a special purity on the part of the dharmadhātu
is [equivalent to] its defilement and purification 195, the absence of erroneous inversion
in relation to the lack of purity and purity is included by [the vajra word] "defilement
and purification". (h) Moreover, the absence of erroneous inversion 196 in relation to
the adventitious nature of defilement and purification on the part of the dharmadhātu is
to be connected with the "resemblance to space". (i) & (j) Since there is no destruction
or growth of the dharmadhātu in relation to its states of defilement and purification, the
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of arrogance is to
be connected with "non-deficiency" and "non-excellence" [listed] among the vajra
words. These ten absences of erroneous inversion are to be connected 197 respectively
with the ten vajra words in this way.
[2] The 'body' of the vajra words is established as follows: the vajra words
are employed with reference to 198 certain categories these categories form their body'.
However, they are also established as fourfold, i.e. by way of: (a) own-being,
(b) objective support, (c) absence of conceptual differentiation and (d)
objections and refutations.
[3] Of these, the three natures called 'perfected', 'imaginary' and
'other-dependent' correspond respectively with the first three [vajra]
words. Therein, the first [three] 199 are: "existence and non-existence", "the absence
of erroneous inversion" and "the basis". Of these, by "existence and non-existence",
the perfected [nature] is referred to; by "the absence of erroneous inversion", the
imaginary [nature] is referred to; by "the basis", the other-dependent [nature] is
referred to. How so? Certain people believe that the perfected is explained as both
existent and non-existent because it both exists and does not exist200. How can it be
due to the fact that the perfected [nature] has the characteristic of both existence and
non-existence?201 Some believe that this is because it is verbally expressed as existent

and non-existent. Others believe that because syllables possess combination and
familiarity, one sees the object as having significance insofar as it is mentally
constructed and, in the contrary case, one sees it as being devoid of significance,
[thus], it is understood that the perfected nature is inexpressible. Hence, this [vajra
word] "existence and non-existence" is said to refer to the perfected nature. Others
again believe that the Dharma that comprises the teachings of the universal vehicle is
described as the perfected nature because: (a) it flows out of the extremely pure dharma-
dhātu and (b) it is the objective support which acts as counteragent to erroneous inver-
sion; and although, as an objective entity its essential nature is conceptually
differentiated 202, it is not imaginary. Hence, [the vajra word] "existence and non-
existence" is said to refer to the perfected. However, others say that "existence and
non-existence" is said to refer to the perfected nature because it is not erroneously
inverted 203. The imaginary is [described] as being without erroneous inversion204
because it is characterized 205 by manifesting in the nature of the duality which does not
exist. The other-dependent is described verbally as "the basis"206; it is described as the
basis because it is the (causal) ground and is described as other-dependent because it is
the result.
[4] These three natures should be known by way of objective support207.
[5] By way of the absence of conceptual differentiation refers to... Since
there are different ways of resolving this compound in this context, he says: (i) that
on account of which one does not conceptually differentiate, i.e. direct
intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation and (ii) that which does
not perform conceptual differentiation in regard to intrinsic luminosity.
These are the different ways of resolving the compound208 (avikalpanatā): (a) there is
an absence of conceptual differentiation (avikalpana) since, on account of this, one
does not conceptually differentiate and (b) there is an absence of conceptual differen-
tiation (avikalpana) since it [i.e. intrinsic luminosity] is not conceptually differentiated.
The state (bhava) of that is [equivalent to] the absence of conceptual differentiation
(avikalpanatā). In this way he shows that the absence of conceptual differentiation is
revealed by these two vajra words [i.e. avikalpanată and prakṛtiprabhāsvaratā]. Then,
by means of these, the establishment of both the object of knowledge

and the act of knowing are to be understood respectively, namely 209,
through the three natures and the absence of conceptual differentiation.
Therein, the object of knowledge is established through the three natures because they
consist in the apprehended object; the act of knowing is established through the
absence of conceptual differentiation because it consists in the apprehending subject.
[6] By way of objections and refutations that are employed refers to the
remaining vajra words210, With regard to this, certain vajra words actually are
refutations of objections; examples of these are "the resemblance to a magical creation",
"the resemblance to space", "non-deficiency" and "non-excellence". However, some
[vajra words] are just objections, for example, "defilement and purification". There-
fore, [the vajra word] "objections and refutations" (codyaparihara) can be [interpreted
both as] 'refutations of objections' and 'objections'; together they produce 'objections
and refutations' (codyaparihārau)211, considering the rule (cf. Panini III.1.94 & I.II.64)
that of two 'original' words (i.e. codyaparihara and codya), only one remains (i.e.
codyaparihārau). This212 is the objection in this regard: "If these dharmas
which are characterized by the imaginary and other-dependent [natures]
are non-existent..., the ellipsis is: as apprehended object and apprehending subject,
how can they be perceived? I.e., as apprehended object and apprehending subject
this is what is intended. On the other hand if they do exist, the intrinsic
luminosity of the dharmas is not tenable"; because they exist in the aspects of
apprehended object and apprehending subject - this is the objection. One refutes
this through their resemblance to a magical creation, i.e. on the grounds
that what comprises a magical creation does not exist yet it is perceived.
For a magical creation exists as a perception; consequently, its existence as such cannot
be known. An objection: if the dharmas possess intrinsic luminosity, how
can they be defiled initially213 and subsequently purified? For, if they are
pure by nature, the defiled state is never possible. Its refutation: Defilement and
purification are to be understood according to their resemblance with
space, i.e. on the grounds that space, which is pure by nature214, can be

defiled by adventitious secondary defilement and then, due to the removal of the
latter, purified 215. Thus, although it is pure by nature, the defilement on the part of
the dharmadhātu is on account of adventitious secondary defilement and purification
[on its behalf] is due to the removal of the latter. An objection: "If there is the
removal of the moral defilement216 of immeasurable numbers of sentient
beings when immeasurable numbers of Buddhas are born, how is
that217, although the Buddhas are born individually in beginningless samsåra,
samsara is not eradicated and nirvapa is not augmented due to the removal
of immeasurable numbers of sentient beings from samsāra and their entry to nirvāṇa?
Its refutation is on the grounds of non-deficiency and non-excellence,
because the realms of sentient beings and 'sides' to purification are
immeasurable. For, the diminution or eradication of something which possesses
limitations can be conceived218 but the realm of sentient beings is immeasurable and its
diminution cannot be conceived, how much less can its eradication, like that of space,
possibly be conceived? Since there is indeed no excellence of purification too because
of its immeasurable nature, how can there be augmentation on its part, like with space,
because both the removal of obscuration and the arising of obscuration belong to it?
[7] Secondly, the 'body' is established 219 as follows, i.e. with reference to
the vajra words:
(a) Wherein, whatever and whence is
error and (b) wherein and whatever
is non-error and indeed (c) the
results of both error and non-error
and (d) the end of these two.
The object of error, the essential nature of error220, the cause of error, the result of error
and the end of the result of error221 are explained by the vajra words. Similarly, the
essential nature of non-error, the object of non-error, the result of non-error and the
end result of the latter222 are explained 223. In regard to the above [verse], "wherein
there is error" refers to existence and non-existence, i.e. the characterizing of syllables
as having significance or being without significance, because the verbal expression and
the object of the expression and the connection between them is imaginatively con-

structed in the nature of an entity. "Whatever is error" refers to erroneous inversion,
i.e. error, because it manifests in the aspect of the duality but is non-existent in itself.
"Whence is error" refers to the fact that error comes from a basis this basis is the
mental activity that is developed by talk and which consists in the store-consciousness.
"And whatever is non-error" refers to the absence of error, i.e. non-dispersal towards
the existence or non-existence of the object which is [in reality] like a magical creation
etc. The absence of error is the counteragent to the error which consists in the notional
attachment to existent and non-existent entities and these are explained respectively
through their resemblance to a magical creation and the absence of conceptual differen-
tiation224. "And wherein" refers to where there is an absence of error; moreover, this
refers to intrinsic luminosity which has the characteristic of the perfected nature. "And
indeed the results of error and non-error": in this regard, defilement is the result of
error the ellipsis is i.e. the natural outcome of error. Since the absence of error
consists in the natural outcome of the absence of error225, the result of the absence of
error is purification because it is the result of the absence of error the ellipsis is -
[purification] together with its associates. The use of the particle "indeed" refers to
these two results described by [the vajra word] 'defilement and purification'; however,
in order to demonstrate that through [the vajra word] 'the resemblance to space', the
results of both error and the absence of error on the part of the dharmadhātu is seen to
have the nature of defilement and purification, but they are not intrinsic to it. "And the
end of these two": some people believe that this refers to the end of both defilement
and purification, i.e. nirvāṇa; moreover, the latter is described as the 'end'226 insofar as
it is without deficiency and excellence. However, others believe that the end of defile-
ment is [equivalent to] the possession of non-deficiency because [defilement] does not
accumulate due to the immeasurable nature of samsära; and the end of purification is
[equivalent to] the possession of non-excellence227 because [purification] does not
increase due to the immeasurable nature of nirvāṇa.

[9] In this context, (a) the view that the connection between a word and its object
belongs to the perfected [nature] is erroneous inversion. (b) The view that objects exist
by way of essential nature in exactly that way in which they appear is erroneous inver-
sion. (c) The view [that incorporates] the cause for the arising of the object is erro-
neous inversion 230, (d) The views that [incorporate] imputation or negation in regard
to the object are erroneous inversion. (e) The view that the own-being of the object is
in accord with its nominal designation231 is erroneous inversion. (f) & (g) The views
that regards the individual or universal characteristics 232 of entities as substantially
existent are erroneous inversion. (h) The view that the purity or the lack of purity of
actions is due to auspicious or inauspicious behaviour is erroneous inversion. The
view that both the lack of purity and purity belong to one and the same [entity] is erro-
neous inversion. (i) & (j) The manifestation of fear and arrogance because of the belief
in deficiency and excellence in regard to the relinquishment and acquisition of defile-
ment and purification [respectively] is erroneous inversion. These are the ten
erroneous inversions; because they are non-existent on the part of the bodhisattva, [the
spiritual practice] which becomes free from erroneous inversion in relation to the cate-
gories as described should be known as the meditative development of penetrating
insight233. The spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma has now
been described.

d. Spiritual Practice in Relation to the Avoidance
of the Two Extremes.
Which is the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two
extremes? That which is taught as the middle way in the Ratnakūţa.
This is to be known as being due to the avoidance of which extremes?
V.23 abcd
V.24 abcd
V.25 abcd
V.26 abcd
The extremes concerning separate-
ness and identity, those of the
tirthika and śravaka, the twofold
extremes of imputation and negation
in regard to the personal entity and
the dharmas.
The extremes concerning adverse
elements and their counteragents,
those termed eternalism and annihi-
lationism, the twofold and threefold
[extremes] concerning the appre-
hended object and apprehending
subject as well as defilement and
purification.
The seven kinds of dual extremes
consisting in conceptual differentia-
tion are also considered in regard to:
(a) existent and non-existent entities,
(b) the object of appeasement and the
[act of] appeasing, (c) the object of
fear and the dread of the latter;
318
(d) The apprehended object and
apprehending subject, (e) correctness
and falsity, (f) performance and
non-performance] and (g) non-
origination and simultaneity these
are the dual extremes that consist in
conceptual differentiation.
Of these, (a) the notion that the self is something separate from form
etc. is one extreme; the notion that it is identical is another extreme.
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. that
which does not investigate a self, concluding with the non-investigation319
of the human kind, for, among the views concerning a self, there is one
view that holds the individual soul to be [identical with the physical
body and [another view that holds] the individual soul to be one [entity]
and the physical body another.
The notion that form is permanent is an extreme embraced by the
tirthikas; the notion that it is impermanent is an extreme embraced by
the śrävakas. The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of
these, i.e. that which does not investigate the permanence, nor does it
investigate the impermanence, of form etc.
The notion that the self exists234 is the extreme of imputation in
regard to the personal entity; the notion that it is insubstantial is the
extreme of negation, for, there is the negation of just that which exists
as a designation. The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both
of these, i.e. the direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation
which holds the mean position between [the existence of a self and its
insubstantiality.
The notion that mind is real is the extreme of imputation in regard to
the dharmas; the notion that it is not real is the extreme of negation.
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. that
[perspective] wherein there is no mind, nor volition, nor thought, nor
consciousness.
The notion that the dharmas, such as those that are unwholesome,
are [equivalent to] defilement is an extreme in regard to adverse
elements; the notion that the wholesome ones etc. are [equivalent to]
purification is an extreme in regard to the counteragent. The middle
way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. that which con-
sists in the non-acceptance, non-utterance and non-communication of
these two extremes.
The notion that both the personal entity and the armas exist is the
extreme of eternalism; the notion that they do not exist is the extreme of
annihilationism. The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of
these since it holds a mean position between the two extremes.
The notion that nescience consists in the apprehended object and
apprehending subject 235 is one extreme; likewise the notion that know-
ledge, the formative forces and the unconditioned which is the counter-
agent to the latter, up until old-age and death, consist in the
apprehended object and apprehending subject is another extreme.

320
Alternatively, the notion that the cessation of these consists in the
apprehended object and apprehending subject is an extreme, i.e. it is
checked by that path. Thus, the extremes in regard to the apprehended
object and apprehending subject are twofold according to their differ-
entiation as belonging to the 'black' or the 'white' side.
The middle way
is for the purpose of avoiding both of these. i.e. in detail, both know-
ledge and nescience are non-dual because of the absence of the
apprehended object and the apprehending subject on the part of know-
ledge and nescience etc.
Defilement is threefold: (a) the defilement of moral defilement, (b)
the defilement of action and (c) the defilement of rebirth. In regard to
these, the defilement of moral defilement is threefold: (i) false view, (ii)
the causes of passion, aversion and delusion and (iii) the resolve for a
new existence. The counteragents to these are: (i) emptiness know-
ledge, (ii) signless knowledge and (iii) non-resolve knowledge. The
defilement of action refers to the formative influence of virtuous and
non-virtuous actions. The counteragent to these is knowledge without
formative influence. The defilement of rebirth refers to: (i) rebirth in a
new existence, (ii) the production of the mind and the mental concomi-
tants every moment in one who is reborn and- (iii) the continuance of a
new existence. The counteragents to these are: (i) non-birth knowledge,
(ii) non-production knowledge and (iii) absence of own-being know-
ledge. The removal of these three kinds of defilement is [equivalent to]
purification. In this regard, through emptiness knowledge etc. the
dharmas that are the objects of emptiness knowledge etc., up to [the
dharmas that are the objects of the absence of own-being knowledge],
are not respectively caused to be emptiness etc. on account of these
three kinds of defilement, [rather], they are emptiness etc. by their very
nature because the dharmadhatu is undefiled by nature. Therefore, if
one imagines that the dharmadhatu is defiled or is purified, this is an
extreme because there can be no defilement or purity on the part of that
which is undefiled by nature. The middle way is for the purpose of
avoiding this extreme, i.e. that which does not cause the dharmas to be
empty through emptiness; on the contrary the dharmas
are already
empty and the same holds for the other [six categories of knowledge].
There are
an additional seven kinds of dual extremes that consist in
conceptual differentiation, for example, the conceptual differentiation in
regard to an existent entity is one extreme and the conceptual differen-"2
173
321
tiation in regard to a non-existent entity is another extreme236. These
are due to imagining that: (a) emptiness is for the destruction of the
belief in the existence of the personal entity, or else, (b) insubstantiality
is non-existent. This middle way is for the purpose of avoiding these
dual extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation. Emptiness is
certainly not for the destruction of the belief in the personal entity,
moreover, emptiness itself is empty. In detail, the same holds for past
emptiness and future emptiness etc.
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the object of appeasement is
one extreme and conceptual differentiation in regard to the [act of]
appeasing is another extreme. These are on account of imaginative con-
structions in regard to the object of relinquishment and the [act of]
relinquishing which are due to fear of emptiness. The example of
'space' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in
conceptual differentiation.
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the object of fear is one
extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the dread of that
object of fear [is another extreme]. These result from fear of imaginary
forms etc. and are on account of the dread of suffering. The example of
the 'painter' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that con-
sist in conceptual differentiation. The former example is in relation to
the śrävaka, but the latter is [in relation to] the bodhisattva.
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is one
extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the apprehending
subject [is another extreme]. The example of the 'magician' is for the
purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual
differentiation. For, the knowledge of the non-existence of the object is
caused by the knowledge of representation-only and the knowledge of
the non-existence of the object annuls that very knowledge of repre-
sentation-only because, if the object is non-existent, its representation
is not possible; thus, these two are similar in this respect.
Conceptual differentiation in regard to correctness is one extreme
and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to falsity [is another extreme].
Both of these conceptually differentiate the investigation of what is real
as correct or false. The example of 'fire coming from two sticks' is for
the purpose of avoiding these two extremes; i.e., just as fire is gener-
ated from two sticks which are devoid of the characteristic of fire and
[the fire] that is generated consumes those two sticks; similarly, the
236 Tika and Tib. Bhaşya confirm a reading of abhave 'pi vikalpo 'ntah; cf. N's fn.14 p.71."
322
noble faculty of wisdom which has the characteristic of correctness is
generated from the investigation [of phenomenal as they are in reality
which is devoid of the characteristic of correctness and [the faculty of
wisdom] that is generated annihilates [through clear understanding] that
investigation of what is real; thus, these two are similar in this respect.
And although the investigation of what is real is devoid of the charac-
teristic of correctness, it does not have the characteristic of falsity
because it is in conformity with correctness.
Conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action is
one extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to the non-per-
formance of action [is another extreme]. Both of these imagine direct
intuition to involve an act that is preceded by intelligence, or else, as
being devoid of efficacy. The example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the
purpose of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual
differentiation.
Conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination is one
extreme and [conceptual differentiation] in regard to simultaneity [is
another extreme], i.e., if one imagines that the counteragent does not
arise, or else, [imagines] defilement to endure for a long time. The
second example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the purpose of avoiding these
two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.
The spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two
extremes has now been described.
[Sthiramati]
Y233.9 [1] Immediately following the spiritual practice that conforms with the Dharma, the
spiritual practice that relates to the avoidance of the two extremes237 should be
mentioned. Hence he asks: which is the spiritual practice in relation to the
avoidance of the two extremes? So he says: that which is taught as the
middle way in the Dharma discourse named the Ratnakūta for the purpose of
illustrating the essential nature of correct spiritual practice. In detail, it is taught as
follows concluding with the second example of the 'oil-lamp¹238:
"In this matter, O Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva who desires instruction through
the Dharma discourse, the Maha239 Ramakūṭa, should apply himself properly to
the Dharma. And as to what is proper application to the Dharma: namely, it is

that which investigates the reality of all dharmas, i.e. which does not investigate
a self, nor does it investigate a sentient being, nor an individual soul, nor a man,
nor mankind 240, nor a personal entity, nor a human, nor the human kind. This
is described as the middle way, O Kāśyapa."241
[2] This is to be known as being due to the avoidance of which
extremes?242 What is meant is: the spiritual practice of the middle way should be
known as being due to the avoidance of which extremes? Hence he says:
V.23 ab
The extremes concerning separate-
ness and identity, those of the
dirthika and śrävaka etc.
These fifteen types are differentiated into two extremes; this [the middle way] is to be
known as being due to the avoidance of these. In this regard, the views concerning
separateness etc. 2
243 are extremes considering that there is the figurative use of a cause
in regard to the effect because one becomes notionally attached each to his own view.
Of these, the notion that the self is something separate from form etc. is
one extreme; the notion that it is identical is another extreme. In this
respect, those [views] which construe form etc., the aggregates, the sense-fields and
the elements as entities to be enjoyed on the part of an eternally existing self are
[equivalent to] the extreme view which holds the self to be something separate from
form etc. Again, the extreme view that the self is identical to form etc. refers to those
[views] which hold the internal formative forces consisting in form etc. to be the self
and which construe that which sees, hears and discerns 244 as the self, and external
things as belonging to the self. There is one view, expressed in a Sūtra, that
holds the individual soul to be [identical with] the physical body and
[another view that holds] the individual soul to be one [entity] and the
physical body another these are described by the word "extreme" in this context.
For the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. for the purpose of avoiding245
the extremes of identity and difference of the self246 in relation to form etc., there is
the middle way247, i.e. direct intuition that has for its object only the dharmas. In
order to demonstrate this, he says: i.e. that which does not investigate a self,
concluding with the non-investigation of a human being. For, when [the

bodhisattva] understands that the self is non-existent, like the son of an infertile
woman, due to the insight that it is only dharmas, he does not see a self; what is meant
is: he does not adhere to [the belief in a self]. What is the reason that its identity or
difference is perceived in relation to form etc. and why is [the self] mentioned by
special synonyms 248, such as "sentient being" when it is understood in that sense just
by the word "self"? Since all [people] do not understand all synonyms, it is explained
through another synonym in order that everyone can understand its meaning. Alterna-
tively, it is for the purpose249 of conveying its meaning through different synonyms to
those who were distracted at a particular time because when it is mentioned through
that description, it is conveyed to others.
[3] The notion that form is permanent250 is an extreme embraced by the
tirthikas. For, having become attached to imaginary form as an entity, they construe
it to be permanent because they are misled through erroneously inverting it as perma-
nent. The notion that it is impermanent is an extreme embraced by the
śrävakas. This is an extreme because they impute a substantial although imperma-
nent nature251 upon form etc. whose essential nature is imaginary. The view that
[form] is impermanent is an extreme because it causes one to shrink excessively from
samsāra and to fall into an extreme in regard to nirvana. For the purpose of
avoiding both of these 252, i.e. for the purpose of avoiding the views [of form] as
permanent or impermanent, there is the middle way, i.e. that which does not
investigate permanence, nor does it investigate the impermanence, of
form etc. Just what is this [middle way]? It is direct intuition free from conceptual
differentiation, i.e. that which does not understand form etc. just in relation to [entities
of] form etc. or as permanent or impermanent. The word "etc." in the term "form
etc."253 refers to the [four other] aggregates of sensation, ideation, the formative forces
and consciousness, the elements of earth, water, fire, wind and space and the sense-
fields of sight, hearing, smell, taste, tactility and mind.
[4] The notion that the self exists is the extreme of imputation in regard
to the personal entity. The [view] which regards the self, which is non-existent in
actuality 254 like the son of an infertile woman, as separate or not separate from the
aggregates, elements or sense-fields is an extreme because it imputes255 the self, in the
nature of an entity, upon the personal entity. The notion that it is insubstantial

is the extreme of negation. For, negation is described as imagining that some-
thing existent is non-existent256. But if the self does not exist, how can its description
as 'insubstantial' be an extreme of negation? For, there is the negation of just
that which exists as a designation257. It is an extreme which negates [the exis-
tence] as something insubstantial that is referred to. Moreover, it is a continuum of
dharmas wherein the close connection of cause and result is evident. Alternatively, it is
a totality in regard to which the designation as god or human [is made]. The middle
way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these, i.e. for the purpose of
avoiding the views that the self exists or does not exist; and now, in order to define
what is the middle way258, he says: i.e. that which holds the mean position 259
between [the existence of a self and its insubstantiality; but what does that
mean consist in? Direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation.
[5] Having shown that conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is
an extreme [and] in order to demonstrate that conceptual differentiation260 in regard to
the apprehending subject is also an extreme, he says: the notion that mind is real
etc. Alternatively, after showing that imputation and negation in regard to the
personal entity is an extreme and in order to show the extremes of imputation and
negation in regard to the dharmas, he says: "the notion that mind is real etc.". The
notion that mind exists as a reality in exactly that way in which it appears, or, as it is
expressed 261. this is the extreme of imputation in regard to the dharmas,
because the own-being of mind 262 which is without reality, is imputed as real. The
notion that mind is not real is the extreme of negation. The view which
regards [mind] as unreal although existent in a nature devoid of the apprehended object
and apprehending subject and inexpressible is an extreme of negation because it com-
pletely negates the own-being of the dharmas. For the purpose of avoiding both
of these, i.e. for the purpose of penetrating the insubstantiality of the dharmas which
is devoid of imputation and negation, there is the middle way, i.e. that
[perspective] wherein there is no mind, nor volition, nor thought, nor
consciousness263; the ellipsis is that the notional attachment (to mind etc.] does [not]

occur264. Alternatively, that sphere within which mind does not arise in its nature as a
collection 265 of latent impressions accompanied by impurity, nor does volition [arise]
characterized by formative influence266, nor does thought in the aspect of self-conceit
[arise], nor does consciousness [arise] as conceptual differentiation - this is described
as the middle way. Therein, "mind" refers to the store-consciousness since it is the
collection of latent impressions of all dharmas accompanied by impurity. "Volition"
refers to the actions of mind and consists in the actions that stimulate mind toward the
wholesome, the unwholesome and the neutral. "Thought" refers to defiled mind.
"Consciousness" refers to the six groups of consciousness.
[6] The notion that the dharmas, such as those that are unwholesome,
are [equivalent to] defilement is an extreme in regard to adverse
elements; the notion that the wholesome ones etc. are [equivalent to]
purification is an extreme in regard to the counteragent. By the word
"etc.", the explanations [of dharmas] are referred to that are reprehensible267, not repre-
hensible, mundane, supramundane, with and without impurity, conditioned and
unconditioned etc. In this respect, the extreme in regard to adverse elements and the
extreme in regard to the counteragent refers to the notion that defilement and purifi-
cation are exactly [equivalent to] the mode in which the unwholesome and wholesome
dharmas appear and are articulated. Therein [the dharmas] are unwholesome because
they have the sense of discomfort; they are reprehensible because they cause the mani-
festation of bad conduct; they are mundane because they are erroneously inverted; they
are accompanied by impurity because they have a propensity towards impurity; they
are conditioned because they are produced from causal conditions. However, the
wholesome ones etc. should be known as the inverse of these. The middle way is
for the purpose of avoiding both of these; the term "both of these" refers to
the adverse element and the counteragent. Since the middle way is not known in rela-
tion to this, he says: that which consists in the non-acceptance, non-utter-
ance and non-communication of these two extremes. Of these, non-
acceptance 268 refers to the absence of the notional attachment to adverse elements and
the counteragent. It is non-utterance because it does not cause others to accept these
extremes in regard to adverse elements and the counteragent. It is non-communication

because it does not recommend 269 [to others] the extremes 270 in regard to adverse
elements and the counteragent.
[7] Having taught the middle way [which acts as counteragent to the extremes
embraced by the tirthikas and śrāvakas and in order to clearly illustrate the middle way
[which acts] as counteragent to the extremes pertinent to the bodhisattva, he says: the
notion that both the personal entity and the dharmas exist is the extreme
of eternalism; the notion that they do not exist is the extreme of annihi-
lationism. The notion that they exist at all times is the extreme of eternalism because
of the imputation of the individual characteristic; the notion that they do not exist is the
extreme of annihilationism because their essential nature is negated, in every respect.
The middle way is for the purpose of avoiding both of these since it
holds a mean position between the two extremes. Some believe that the
"mean" in this context is intended as being separate from both extremes. Others main-
tain that the "mean" here lies between these two extremes 271 and has the characteristic
of both. Having considered [these two views], how [should it be understood]? The
extreme of eternalism refers to the notional attachment to the view that an entity that is
an object both of knowledge and verbal description, like the imagination of what is
unreal or the dharmadhātu, exists substantially and in an ultimate sense - [this is an
extreme] because these [entities] do not exist as such. Similarly 272, the view that [an
entity] definitely does not exist, like the horns of a hare, is the extreme of annihila-
tionism. What is the reason? Because it does exist as a designation. Hence, since it
denies [the existence of the latter, it is described as the extreme of annihilationism.
Consequently, that which holds the mean position between existence and non-existence
has the characteristic of both since it does not exist substantially nor in an ultimate
sense and does exist as a designation.
[8] With reference to the extreme of imputation in regard to the adverse elements and
their counteragent, he says: the notion that nescience consists in the appre-
hended object and apprehending subject273 is one extreme; likewise the
notion that knowledge, the formative forces and the unconditioned,
which is the counteragent to the latter, consists in the apprehended
object and apprehending subject, is another extreme. Moreover, because of
the reference here to the final member [of the twelve nidäna by the words]: up until
old-age and death, consciousness and name/form etc. are also included. The notion
that consciousness consists in the apprehended object and apprehending subject is an

extreme; similarly, the notion that name/form, the six sense-fields, contact, sensation,
craving, grasping, becoming, birth and also old-age and death, consist in the appre-
hended object and apprehending subject is also an extreme. Therein, nescience
consists in an absence of the knowledge of the [four] truths and the [three] jewels. The
formative forces are impure volitions which have meritorious, demeritorious and
neutral274 [tendencies] for their own-being because they are the formative influences
for the new existence. Similarly, consciousness etc. should be stated in detail in a way
that conforms with the explanations [given in the section entitled]: The Characteristic
of Defilement¹275. Knowledge refers to direct intuition devoid of impurity. The
counteragent to the formative forces refers just to direct intuition that is unconditioned;
it is only hence276 and in order to distinguish it from other unconditioned [elements]
that he says: "the counteragent to the latter". However, others consider that in this
respect the unconditioned is also eightfold277 because of the fact that it possesses non-
origination; but the counteragent refers to volition that is without impurity278 because it
does not formatively influence the new existence. Alternatively, the notion that
the cessation of these consists in the apprehended object and appre-
hending subject is an extreme. By the word "these", (the nidänal beginning
with consciousness and concluding with old-age and death, are referred to. Since it is
not known whether sensation is an entity or a cause, he says: it, i.e. name/form, is
checked by that...; by what is name/form checked? By the path which is without
impurity and which is the counteragent to name/form. Knowledge and nescience
which are non-dual do not make a duality, thus, in this context the path is comprised
only by direct intuition together with its associated elements. Consequently 279, since
[name/form] is checked by this [i.e. the path], there is cessation; but what is the
extreme here280? Just the notional attachment to the apprehended object and appre-
hending subject. What is the reason? Because the imposition of a non-existing duality
occurs in regard to nescience etc. which are non-dual by nature281. Thus, the
extremes in regard to the apprehended object and apprehending subject
are twofold according to their differentiation as belonging to the 'black'
or the 'white' side. There in, the 'black' side refers to the twelve limbs that consist
in becoming, i.e. from nescience up until old-age and death. Likewise, the 'white' side
refers to the same twelve modes according to their differentiation as the cessation of

nescience etc., i.e. from the cessation of ignorance up until the cessation of old-age and
death. Moreover, in this context, it is just the path that is the counteragent to these
[twelve] that is signified by the word "cessation" since ignorance etc. is checked on
account of it. For the purpose of avoiding these, i.e. for the purpose of avoid-
ing the extremes that consist in the apprehended object and apprehending subject282,
the middle way is mentioned, i.e. is referred to. And since the latter283 is not
known, he says: both knowledge and nescience are non-dual. How can
knowledge and nescience, up until old-age and death and the cessation of the latter, be
non-dual? Hence he says: because of the absence of the apprehended object
and apprehending subject on the part of knowledge and nescience etc.
However, that absence is because of the fact that nescience etc. is non-dual by nature.
Alternatively, since both knowledge and nescience have an imaginary nature, know-
ledge and nescience are non-dual since the non-existence of both knowledge and
nescience, which have an imaginary nature, is the same. It should be stated similarly
for the formative forces, the unconditioned, consciousness and the cessation of the
latter, up until old-age and death and its cessation. But what is the middle way in this
context? Just this knowledge that, since knowledge and nescience are non-dual284 and
do not make a duality 285, the knowledge to be generated is non-existent and the
nescience to be checked is non-existent, the formative forces to be relinquished are
non-existent and the cessation of the latter which is to be attained is non-existent. The
knowledge that this is so is the non-making of duality286
[9] Defilement is threefold. In this respect, moral defilements 287 are described as
defilements either because: (a) they cause the defilements of action and rebirth and (b)
they are defiled in themselves; alternatively, it is because they cause disturbance to
oneself and others. Action is also described as defilement, because: (a) it develops
under the influence of moral defilement, (b) it is the cause of rebirth and (c) certain
[actions] are morally defiled in themselves. Rebirth too is [described as] defilement
because it is both the cause288 of the moral defilement of action and it is the basis of all
misfortune289. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the threefold differentiation of the
defilement of moral defilements, he says: the defilement of moral defilement is
threefold etc. Of these, (i) false view refers to the five beginning with the false

view of individuality. (ii) Passion, aversion and delusion indeed are causes
because they are causes of grief etc. and the new existence. However, others say that
the causes of passion etc. are: the sense faculties and objects conducive to it, superficial
mental attention and the latent impressions of passion etc. that are lodged in the store-
consciousness; but they claim that they, as they appear as these [i.e. passion etc.], are
the cause of passion etc. (iii) The resolve for a new existence; i.e. the desire
for a new existence. The counteragents to these are: (i) emptiness know-
ledge etc. Of these, the counteragent to false views is emptiness knowledge; in this
context, emptiness knowledge refers to knowledge that has emptiness for its object.
The counteragent to the cause of passion etc. is (ii) signless knowledge because it
is devoid of all signs. Alternatively, signless knowledge refers to knowledge that has
the signless for its object because it has the emptiness of imaginary passion etc. for its
object. The counteragent to the resolve for the new existence is non-resolve
knowledge. Non-resolve knowledge 290 refers to knowledge that is either devoid of
the resolve for the new existence, or else, which has the emptiness of the new existence
for its object. The defilement of action refers to the formative influence of
virtuous and non-virtuous actions 291. Formative influence refers to the
accumulation and actualization of the actions, both virtuous and non-virtuous, which
project the new existence. The counteragent to these is knowledge without
formative influence. Knowledge without formative influence refers to that know-
ledge, on account of which, one's actions do not formatively influence the new
existence; and this has thusness for its object. The defilement of rebirth refers
to: (i) the birth in a new existence, i.e. the mind at conception; (ii) the aris-
ing of the mind and the mental concomitants every moment in one who
has been born, i.e. subsequent to conception, up until death 292; and (iii) the
continuance of the new existence, i.e. the death state in accompaniment with
moral defilement which is followed immediately by the intermediate state293 and
following from the latter comes the rebirth state. However, for those who have gained
the formless attainments, the rebirth state follows immediately after the death state.
The counteragents to these are: (i) non-birth knowledge, (ii) non-
production knowledge and (iii) the absence of own-being knowledge.
Of these, the non-birth knowledge refers to the knowledge that all dharmas are 'unborn'
since they have the nature of imaginative construction; alternatively, it is that which has
emptiness for its object294. The non-production knowledge refers to the knowledge

that has for its object the emptiness of the imaginary dharmas because one penetrates
their non-production on account of this [knowledge]. The absence of own-being
knowledge refers to the knowledge that the continued existence of an entity 295 is
devoid of own-being, because, like the son of an infertile woman, it does not exist.
These seven kinds of knowledge beginning with emptiness knowledg are the counter-
agents to the seven kinds of adverse elements beginning with false view as have just
been described. The removal of these three kinds of defilement consisting in
moral defilement, action and rebirth which are differentiated as sevenfold is
[equivalent to] purification; 'removal' [has the sense of] relinquishment. How-
ever, others believe that purification refers to thusness, the path and nirvana because
the resolution of the term [apagama] is as follows: [defilement] departs (apagacchau) in
it [i.e. tathată], by means of it [i.e. märga] and there is the departure itself [i.e. nirvāṇa],
therefore, purification refers to thusness etc. In this regard, ...through empti-
ness knowledge etc....; due to the word "etc.", the following are included: empti-
ness knowledge, signless knowledge, non-resolve knowledge, knowledge without
formative influence, non-birth knowledge, non-production knowledge and absence of
own-being knowledge. The dharmas that are the objects of emptiness
knowledge etc....; and here too, by the word "etc.", the following are included: the
object of emptiness knowledge, the object of signless knowledge, the object of non-
resolve knowledge, the object of knowledge without formative influence296, the object
of non-birth knowledge, the object of non-production knowledge and the object of the
absence of own-being knowledge all of which are characterized by the perfected
[nature]. Up to [the dharmas that are the objects of the absence of own-
being knowledge), are not respectively caused to be emptiness etc. on
account of these three kinds of defilement; i.e. the dharmas that are the object
of emptiness knowledge etc., which are separate from the defilements of moral defile-
ment, action and rebirth that were just described, are not caused [to be empty etc.]
through emptiness knowledge etc. 297 What is the reason that they are not caused [to be
empty etc.]? Because they are emptiness etc. by their very nature. What is
meant is: they are devoid of the own-being of false view etc. by their very nature. As
to why this is so, he says: because the dharmadhātu is undefiled by nature.
Hence, since the dharmas that are the object of emptiness knowledge etc. are emptiness
etc. by their very nature, they are not caused [to be empty etc.] through emptiness
knowledge etc. The term "respectively" has the sense of 'appropriate' in this context,
i.e. the object of emptiness knowledge which is devoid of, or free from the defilement

of false view, is not caused 298 [to be empty] through emptiness knowledge299 because
the emptiness of false view is, in itself, devoid of the own-being of false view. Thus,
the object of signless knowledge which is devoid of the sign of passion etc. is not
caused [to be signless] through signless knowledge because the emptiness of the sign
of passion etc. is, in itself, signless. The object of non-resolve knowledge is not
caused [to be non-resolve] through non-resolve knowledge because the emptiness of
resolve is, by its very nature, characterized by non-resolve300. The object of know-
ledge without formative influence is not caused [to be devoid of formative influence]
through knowledge that is without formative influence because the emptiness of
formative influence is, by its very nature, characterized by the absence of formative
influence. The object of non-birth knowledge is not caused [to be non-born] through
non-birth knowledge because the emptiness of birth is, by its very nature, characterized
by non-birth. The object of non-production knowledge 301 is not caused [to be non-
produced] through non-production knowledge because the emptiness of the production
of the mind and the mental concomitants every moment is, by its very nature, charac-
terized by non-production. The object of the absence of own-being knowledge is not
caused [to be devoid of own-being] through the absence of own-being knowledge
because the emptiness of the new existence is, by its very nature, devoid of own-being.
Alternatively, the statement: "...respectively...on account of the three kinds of defile-
ment etc.", [can be interpreted as follows]: a particular dharma of the dharmas that are
objects of emptiness knowledge etc. which has a connection with the defilements of
moral defilement, action and rebirth that are differentiated as sevenfold, i.e. with a
particular variety of defilement, is not caused [to be emptiness ] 302 through emptiness
knowledge etc.; on the contrary, it is understood (adhigamyate) [to be emptiness]. In
this respect, emptiness knowledge is connected with defilement that consists in false
view, and similarly up to [the seventh relation wherein] the absence of own-being
knowledge is connected with [defilement that consists in the continuance of the new
existence. What is the reason that [the object of emptiness knowledge etc.] is not
caused [to be empty etc.]? Because these dharmas are emptiness etc. by their very
nature for the dharmadhātu is undefiled by nature. In this respect, false views are not
caused to be empty through emptiness knowledge, because, by their very nature they
are characterized by emptiness. The sign of passion etc. is not caused to be signless
through signless knowledge303 because the dharmadhatu is signless by its very nature.
Likewise up to [the seventh category wherein] the continuance of the new existence is
not caused to be devoid of own-being through the absence of own-being knowledge

for even when the counteragent has not arisen, the imaginary nature is simply non-
existent; and since this is the case, then, if one imagines at the dharmadhātu
is defiled or is purified, this is an extreme. What is the reason?
He says:
because there can be no defilement or purity304 on the part of that
which, like space, is undefiled by nature. The middle way is for the
purpose of avoiding this extreme, i.e. that which does not cause the
dharmas, which are the objects of emptiness knowledge etc.305 and which consist in
the perfected nature, to be empty 306, i.e. as devoid of false view etc. which belongs
to the other-dependent nature and is adverse to it307 [i.e. the perfected nature] through
emptiness in the nature of knowledge 308. On the contrary, the dharmas are
already empty of the essential nature of false view which belongs to the imaginary
nature, even when knowledge has not arisen. Similarly, [the middle way] does not
cause the dharmas to be signless through [the knowledge of] signlessness, [rather] the
dharmas are already signless, and so on up to [the seventh category in relation to which
the middle way] does not cause the dharmas to be devoid of own-being through [the
knowledge of their absence of own-being, [rather] the dharmas are already devoid of
own-being. "A perspective such as this, O Kāśyapa, is described as an investigation
of the reality of the dharmas."309 In this way, both the existence of knowledge and the
existence of what is adverse to it are revealed310 as being devoid of the imaginary
nature; thus, the repudiation of the extremes that consist in imposition and negation is
complete.
[10] The above [represents] the classification of conceptual differentiation in sequen-
tial order; in addition to these there are seven kinds of dual extremes that
consist in conceptual differentiation. In order to demonstrate [this] classifica.
tion of conceptual differentiation, he says: for example, the conceptual differ-
entiation in regard to an existent entity is one extreme and the
conceptual differentiation in regard to a non-existent entity is another
extreme. How so? Hence he says: these are due to imagining that: (a)
emptiness is for the destruction of the belief in the existence of the
personal entity, or else, (b) insubstantiality is non-existent. If
[knowledge] does not cause the dharmas to be empty through emptiness [knowledge]
because they are empty by nature, then in that case, emptiness is for the destruction of

that [notion] that the personal entity exists, or else [the notion that) insubstantiality does
not exist because of the non-existence of the personal entity; for, without an adverse
element, there is no counteragent. Therefore, it is to be accepted necessarily that the
personal entity exists or, that insubstantiality does not³11. Conceptual differentiation in
regard to the existence312 and non-existence of these two is an extreme. The middle
way is for the purpose of avoiding these dual extremes that consist in
conceptual differentiation in regard to existence and non-existence.
"Emptiness, O Kāśyapa, is certainly not for the destruction of the
personal entity, moreover, emptiness itself is empty etc." - thus is the
quotation from the Sūtra³13. In this respect, emptiness is neither for the destruction of
the defiled personal entity, nor for the production of a purified314 personal entity for
there can be no destruction nor production of the personal entity because it exists just
as a designation, like an 'army' etc. Moreover, emptiness itself is empty but it is not
[empty] of the personal entity that is imputed through the false view of individuality
because the latter is absolutely non-existent. After considering it in this way, the
emptiness of the personal entity and the dharmas by way of substantiality is not an ens
because it is devoid of the latter; nor is it a non-ens since it consists in the perfected
[nature]315. Moreover, in order to illustrate that emptiness does consist in the perfected
[nature], he says: the same holds for past emptiness, future emptiness and
the emptiness of the present316 because it illustrates the fact that [emptiness]
exists as such in all the three times; alternatively, it is because it illustrates the fact that
[emptiness] exists as such in the states of the ordinary person, the adept and the one
still in training. Of these, the [emptiness of the] past refers to the state of the ordinary
person; future [emptiness] refers to the state of the adept; and the [emptiness of the]
present refers to the state of the one still in training. And since the emptiness of own-
being of existent and non-existent entities is thus, it is therefore said that: "you should
rely on emptiness, O Kāśyapa"³17, because it is the object of direct intuition free from
conceptual differentiation, "...do not [rely on] the personal entity318", because it is just a
verbal expression.

335
differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme has to be understood 319. How
so? Hence he says: these are on account of imaginative constructions in
regard to the object of relinquishment and the [act of] relinquishing
which are due to the fear of emptiness. Of these, the object of appeasement is
[equivalent to] the object of relinquishment; the [act of] appeasing is [equivalent to] the
[act of] relinquishing. After imagining the dharmas to be [equivalent to] objects of
relinquishment and [the knowledge of] emptiness to be [equivalent to] the relinquish-
ing 320, fear is generated in regard to emptiness; for, how can the three kinds of defile-
ment be objects of relinquishment if they are empty by nature? Hence, they, like the
personal entity, ought not be objects of relinquishment and consequently, since there
can be no relinquishing in the absence of the object of relinquishment, fear is generated
in regard to emptiness this is certainly an extreme. What is the reason? Because
[people] are notionally attached to the fact that the dharmas of form and sensation etc.
exist substantially in exactly that way in which they are transformed 321 in the nature of
consciousness. They fear³22 emptiness due to ignorance³23 of the fact that those
[dharmas] of form etc. whose essential nature is imaginary, are, by their very nature,
non-existent like the self. Therefore, the example of 'space' is for the purpose
of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentia-
tion. For instance:
"[Just as] a certain person who is afraid of space324 may beat his chest and
cry out saying: "remove this space!" What do you think, Kãśyapa, would he be
able to remove the space?" (Kāśyapa] replies: "Certainly not, O Venerable
One." The Venerable One continues: "Similarly, Kaśyapa³25, I would say that
those śramanas and brahmans who are fearful in regard to emptiness have met
with a severe distraction; and for what reason? Because, O Kaśyapa, they go
astray in regard to emptiness itself and are consequently fearful of it".326
This is what is being said: just as one is unable to remove space because it consists in
all form, similarly, emptiness cannot be removed since it is established in all dharmas at
all times, and emptiness cannot be removed from the state of being established through

the non-relinquishment of dharmas327, nor can emptiness be established through the
relinquishment of dharmas and he consequently shows that this is a groundless fear.
[12] Conceptual differentiation328 in regard to the object of fear is an
extreme and in regard to the dread of that object of fear; it is the fact that
conceptual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred to.
That, from which fear arises, is described as the object of fear; insofar as one becomes
fearful of this, there is dread, i.e. an undesirable result of that [original fear]. That
which one imaginatively construes in regard to both the object of fear and the dread [of
the latter] are the extremes329. How so? Hence he says: these result from fear of
imaginary forms etc. and are on account of the dread of suffering. For,
naive people, after imagining forms etc. which have an imaginary nature330 as being
substantial, then imagine the fear from these [forms etc.] and their undesired result.
Consequently, on account of their dread of suffering, they become fearful both of their
forms etc. and their signs. The example of the 'painter' is for the purpose of
avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentiation.
For instance:
"[Just as] a painter, O Kāśyapa, after creating the terrifying figure of a
yakşa331 by himself is rendered unconscious after collapsing and falling face-
first in abject terror332 of it; similarly, O Kaśyapa, al1333 ordinary naive people,
after creating forms, sounds, odours, tastes and tangible things by themselves.
wander in samsāra because of those [forms etc.] and fail to understand those
dharmas as they are in reality" 334
Moreover, just as the painter, having, through false conceptual differentiation, super-
imposed the existence of a real yakṣa upon the terrifying figure of the yakşa that he
himself has created, and fearing it, is rendered unconscious, similarly, all ordinary
people who are impelled by false conceptual differentiation wander in samsāra on
account of their individual conceptual differentiations 335 which are described as their
own creations and are in a momentary state because they are not established in homo-
geneous groups. The former example is in relation to the śrävaka but the

latter is [in relation to] the bodhisattva. Some believe that the śrävaka is
afraid of emptiness because he has not gained mastery over emptiness; however, the
bodhisattva is defiled by conceptual differentiation in regard to the imaginary dharmas
because moral defilement consists in conceptual differentiation. Others believe there is
no meaningful distinction between the two, nevertheless, they are verbally expressed as
a pair on account of the influence of the two categories. Others again believe that due
to his fear of emptiness, the śrävaka fails to understand what is to be understood336;
although the bodhisattva's [failure to understand] is due to his fear of the dharmas that
are conceptually differentiated. Others believe that the former [example acts] as the
counteragent to the [tendency to] cling to the self, whereas the latter [acts] as the
counteragent to the [tendency to] cling to the dharmas.
[13] Conceptual differentiation in regard to the apprehended object is an
extreme and in regard to the apprehending subject; it is the fact that concep-
tual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred to. How
can these apprehended objects of form etc. and their apprehending subjects, i.e. the
groups of consciousness which are perceived in terms of individual characteristic and
result, have the nature of superimposition337 like the self etc.? It is the imaginative
construction of apprehended object and apprehending subject as substantial entities that
is intended as an extreme. The example of the 'magician' is for the purpose
of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differentia-
tion. For instance:
"[Just as], O Kāśyapa, a magician conjures up a magical creation, then that
which is created by means of the magical show338 may devour the magician
himself; similarly, O Käsyapa, when a bhikṣu who practises spiritual discipline
(yogācāra) is mentally attentive339 to any particular objective support³40,
everything appears as just a void for him etc".341
How does one thereby avoid342 the two kinds of extreme that consist in the conceptual
differentiation of this kind? Hence he says: for, the knowledge of the non-
existence of the object is caused by the knowledge of representation-
only and that knowledge of the non-existence of the object annuls that
very knowledge of representation-only, because if the object is non-
existent, its representation343 is not possible; thus these [two] are

similar in this respect. The knowledge of representation-only functions as the
magician [in the example]; the knowledge of the non-existence of the object functions
as the yakşa that is conjured up, for, the knowledge of the non-existence of the object
is characterized by the knowledge that it is representation-only. In the same way that
[the yakşa] which is conjured up may devour its creator, similarly, the knowledge of
the non-existence of the object will 'devour' that very knowledge of the latter as repre-
sentation-only, considering that the perception of the object is a representation,
because, if the object does not exist, that it is representation-only is not possible.
[14] Conceptual differentiation in regard to correctness is an extreme
and in regard to falsity; it is the fact that conceptual differentiation [in regard to
the latter] is another extreme that is referred to. In the state that is conducive to pene-
tration, both of these conceptually differentiate the investigation of what
is real as being dual extremes, i.e. as correct or false. How so? Correctness
refers to the dharmas that are without impurity; falsity refers to those that are accompa-
nied by impurity. In this respect, if one attaches to the investigation of what is real just
in terms of correctness, then it is [only an investigation of the wholesome dharmas
that are accompanied by impurity and it would not constitute an investigation of what is
real. Again, if [the investigation of what is real is thought to be] characterized by
incorrectness, then it is only falsity that is produced like the wholesome [dharmas] that
are associated with the three realms of existence344. The example of 'fire coming
from two sticks' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes. For
instance:
"[Just as], O Käsyapa, a fire is generated in dependence upon two sticks and
that very [fire] being generated 345 consumes those two sticks, similarly, O
Kāśyapa, the noble faculty of wisdom is generated in dependence upon the
investigation of what is real and when it has been generated, it consumes that
very investigation of what is real".346
This is what is meant here: just as fire is generated from two sticks which
are devoid of the characteristic of fire and [the fire] that is generated
consumes the same two sticks, similarly, the noble faculty of wisdom,
which has the characteristic of correctness, is generated from the inves-
tigation of what is real347 which is devoid of the characteristic of
correctness348, and [the faculty of wisdom] that is generated annihilates

339
[through clear understanding]349, i.e. consumes, that very investigation of
what is real thus is the meaning. The latter is described as "consumed" it being as
if consumed due to precisely the destruction because one observes that it is modified.
And even if this investigation of what is real is 350 accompanied by impurity, it is
described as the investigation of what is real because it is in conformity with
correctness.

[15] Conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action is
an extreme and in regard to the non-performance of action; it is the fact
that conceptual differentiation [in regard to the latter] is another extreme that is referred
to. How so? Hence he says: both imagine direct intuition to involve an act
that is preceded by intelligence, or else, as being devoid of efficacy.
Having considered: “I will relinquish nescience" if this direct intuition³51
engages in
activity for the sake of the relinquishment of that [nescience], this is the extreme that
consists in conceptual differentiation in regard to the performance of action. The
notion that, because of its momentary nature, the existence of direct intuition is not
possible at the time of the performance of action that leads to relinquishment and
consequently is not able to relinquish nescience, is the extreme that consists in
conceptual differentiation in regard to the non-performance of action. The example
of the oil-lamp' is for the purpose of avoiding these two extremes that
consist in conceptual differentiation. For instance:
"[Just as], O Kaśyapa, when an oil-lamp is lit, pitch-darkness vanishes and
by no means, O Kaśyapa, does the oil-lamp have this thought: "I can disperse
all pitch-darkness"; on the contrary, pitch-darkness vanishes in dependence
upon the oil-lamp. Similarly, O Kaśyapa, when direct intuition arises,
nescience vanishes and by no means, O Käsyapa, does direct intuition have this
thought: "I can disperse nescience". On the contrary, nescience vanishes in
dependence upon direct intuition".352
This is what being said: in the same way that, although a lamp is empty of the
performance of action and is devoid of the intention to dispel pitch-darkness, just
through the mere presence of the lamp, all darkness³53 vanishes from that place where
it is lit354. Similarly, direct intuition that is free from conceptual differentiation is
produced in one's mental continuum and nescience vanishes from that mental contin-
uum just because of the mere fact that it is present there. There is no [deliberate] act

(kriya) on the part of direct intuition because it is devoid of conceptual differentiation.
And similarly, because of the absence of the efficacy of the performance of action on
the part of direct intuition³55, it dispels adverse elements356 through its mere presence,
like the lamp.
[16] Conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination is an
extreme and in regard to simultaneity; the fact that conceptual differentiation [in
regard to the latter] is another extreme is understood. How so? Hence he says: if one
imagines that the counteragent does not arise...; the extreme that consists in
conceptual differentiation in regard to non-origination refers to the notion that insofar
as the counteragent has not arisen for a period of time in the past, so too will it not arise
in the present.
Or else, [one imagines] defilement to endure for a long
time; i.e. if nescience is only established as the counter correlate to direct intuition,
direct intuition does not have the capacity to arise and if it is produced in some way,
even so, the removal of nescience is unable to be carried out by means of direct
intuition whose nature is momentary because [nescience] has developed over a long
period of time, and consequently, there would be simultaneity on the part of defilement
and purification. The second example of the 'oil-lamp' is for the purpose
of avoiding these two extremes that consist in conceptual differen-
tiation. For instance:
"[Just as], O Kāśyapa, there is an oil-lamp in a house, an abode, or a
cottage 357 which has not been lit by anyone for over a thousand years, then if
some person were to light that oil-lamp - what do you think, O Kaśyapa, would
the pitch-darkness have this thought: "I have accumulated for a thousand years
and I shall not depart from here"?" [Kaśyapa] replied: "Indeed not, O Vener-
able One, for when the oil-lamp is lit, pitch-darkness does not have the power
not to depart - it must necessarily depart from there." The Venerable One then
said: "Similarly, O Kāśyapa, although karma and moral defilement have
accumulated for hundreds of thousands of aeons, they vanish in an instant on
account of an investigation facilitated by proper mental attention ³58. As to the
oil-lamp, O Kāśyapa, it is an epithet for the noble faculty of wisdom; the pitch-
darkness, O Kāśyapa³59, is an epithet for karma and moral defilement." "360
By means of this simile [the Buddha] refutes [the notions that]: (a) the counteragent
does not arise on the grounds that its arising is dependent upon conditions and (b) the

Spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes
has now been described.
e. Specific and Non-specific Spiritual Practice.
Which are the specific and non-specific spiritual practices?
V.27 ab
The specific and non-specific are to
be known in relation to the ten
spiritual levels;
That perfection which predominates on a particular spiritual level is
specific to that [level]. When [the bodhisattva] becomes fully accom-
plished in every respect in regard to all [the perfections], it is
[described as] non-specific.
The supremacy in relation to spiritual practice has now been
described.
[Sthiramati]
Y251.4 [1] The specific and non-specific spiritual practices were listed immediately after the
spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two extremes. Hence, immediately
following the explanation of the spiritual practice in relation to the avoidance of the two
extremes, he asks: which
are the specific and non-specific spiritual
practices? Hence he says:
V.27 ab
361
The specific and non-specific are to
be known in relation to the ten
spiritual levels;
In relation to each of the ten spiritual levels361 there are two modes of spiritual practice.
How so? Hence he says: that perfection which predominates on a particular
spiritual level etc. A bodhisattva established on a particular bodhisattva level
applies himself strenuously to a particular perfection; the latter predominates in com-
parison with the other perfections on that bodhisattva level and is described as
specific. For example, on the first spiritual level the perfection of generosity pre-
Y inserts: tāsu daśasu bhūmişv ekaikaśo, on the basis of the Tib.: sa bcu po de dag re re la
(D313b.5), which is not found in the Ms.342
dominates and thus the spiritual practice in regard to it is described as "specific". The
same applies [to the other spiritual levels], up until the perfection of direct intuition on
the tenth [level]. When [the bodhisattva] becomes fully accomplished in
regard to all the remaining perfections on each of the spiritual levels362, without
distinction, the spiritual practice on these [levels] is described as non-specific; as has
been stated: "on the joyous level [i.e. the first level] the perfection of generosity
predominates...". And nor does [the bodhisattva] not become fully accomplished in
regard to the other [perfections] according to his power and capacity 363. The explana-
tions concerning the remaining spiritual levels should similarly be known in accor-
dance with the Sutras.
The supremacy in relation to spiritual practice has now been

3. Supremacy of Objective Support.
Which are the supremacies of objective support?
V.27 cd & 28 abcd
These are considered to consist in:
(a) the establishment, (b) the
[dharma]dhātu, (c) the probandum,
(d) the probans, (e) retention, (f)
correct determination, (g) preserva-
tion, (h) penetration, (i) diffusion,
(j) understanding, (k) meditative
calm and (1) the culminating objec-
tive support.
343
There are twelve kinds of objective support, namely, (a) the objec-
tive support for establishing the designations of the dharmas; (b) the
dharmadhatu as objective support; (c) the probandum as objective
support; (d) the probans as objective support; (e) the objective support
for retention; (f) the objective support for correct determination; (g) the
objective support for preservation; (h) the objective support for pene-
tration; (i) the objective support for diffusion; (j) the objective support
for understanding; (k) the objective support for meditative calm and (1)
the culminating objective support. Of these, the first refers to those
dharmas that are respectively determined as the perfections etc. The
second refers to thusness. The third and fourth refer respectively to
[the latter] two again because [the bodhisattva] arrives at an under-
standing of the dharmas, such as the perfections, through his penetra-
tion of the dharmadhātu. The fifth is the objective support for the
knowledge that consists in learning. The sixth [is the objective support
for the knowledge that] consists in reflection since [the bodhisattva]
retains it after having understood it. The seventh [is the objective
support for the knowledge that] consists in meditative development due
to its retention [by each bodhisattva), individually. The eighth is [the
objective support] on the first spiritual level for the path of vision. The
ninth is [the objective support] for the path of meditative development,
up until the seventh spiritual level. The tenth is [the objective support]
for the mundane and supramundane paths on that same [level] because
[the bodhisattva) arrives at the understanding of the Dharma in itsY252.2
344
various modes 364. The eleventh is [the objective support] on the eighth
spiritual level. The twelfth is [the objective support] on the three spiri-
tual levels beginning with the ninth. And those [original] first and
second [objective supports] receive nominal designations as the respec-
tive objective supports pertinent to each state.
The objective supports have now been described.
[Sthiramati]
[1] Since this is the appropriate place for an explanation of supremacy in relation to the
objective support365, he says: which are the supremacies of objective
support?³66 Hence, in order to define these³67, he says:
V.27 a
[They are considered to consist in]:
(a) the establishment, (b) the
[dharma}dhātu etc.
There are twelve kinds of objective support, beginning with the objective
support for establishing, up until the culminating objective support.
These are described as the supremacies in relation to the objective supports 368 because
they are pre-eminent in comparison with all the other objective supports; it is just the
highest that is supreme and this refers to something unequalled and extraordinary 369,
Of these, the first refers to those dharmas which are [respectively
determined] as the perfections etc.; and since these are respectively deter-
mined by the Buddhas and bodhisattvas for the purpose of helping sentient beings,
they are [equivalent to] the term "establishment". In order to demonstrate just this, the
author of the commentary says: the objective support for establishing the
designations of the dharmas. The designations of the dharmas refers to the
designations of the dharmas, such as the perfection of generosity, the factors that
contribute to enlightenment and the noble truths etc., i.e. [the dharmas] are established
by such [a designation]370; or else, that [i.e. the designation] is [equivalent to the
establishment in this regard thus is the establishment of the designations of the
dharmas. And in the following 371, the successive order of the objective supports,

beginning with the establishment, shall be shown because [this order] is in conformity
with one's direct realization. The second refers to thusness because it is
synonymous with 'dharmadhātu'. The third and fourth...; of these, the third refers
to the probandum as objective support and the fourth, the probans as objective support;
refer to the latter two, i.e. the first and the second, respectively. The first refers
to the probandum as objective support and the second refers to the probans
as objective support. He provides the reason in regard to this: since [the
bodhisattva] arrives at an understanding of the dharmas, such as the
perfections, through his penetration of the dharmadhātu. What is meant
is372: they arrive at an understanding of the perfections which are devoid of impurity
due to their penetration of the dharmadhātu³73, i.e. firstly, they have the probandum as
objective support, and secondly, the probans as objective support. The fifth, the
objective support for retention, is for the knowledge that consists in
learning 374. The knowledge that consists in learning is described as retention
because it holds fast to the dharmas such as the perfections and to the dharmadhātu,
upon hearing it [for the first time]. The term: "the objective support for retention"
(dhāraṇālambanam) is [resolved as]: the objective support that leads to retention
(dhāraṇāyā ālambanam); furthermore, it refers to the first and second [objective
supports], i.e. (a) the objective support for establishment and (b) the dharmadhātu as
objective support. The sixth [is the objective support for knowledge that]
consists in reflection because [the bodhisattva] retains it after having
understood it. [The bodhisattva) arrives at an understanding by means of [the four
kinds of reasoning, i.e. (a) dependence, (b) cause and effect, (c) proof of logical
possibility and (d) real nature, due to his retention of the meaning of what is learnt.
Correct determination refers to the knowledge that consists in reflection; its objective
support is the objective support for correct determination. The seventh is
that [of the knowledge] that consists in meditative development; that it is
the objective support for the latter is understood. Due to its retention [by each
bodhisattva], individually - preservation is due to retention of the meaning [by
each bodhisattva], individually. The knowledge that consists in meditative develop-
ment is applicable to the entry to the first spiritual level. Furthermore, this relates to the
applications of mindfulness, up until the powers, and its objective support is the
objective support for preservation. The eighth is [the objective
support] for the path of vision on the first spiritual level. This refers to
the penetration of the all-pervading nature of the dharmadhātu which is without duality

[by the bodhisattvas], individually. Alternatively, penetration refers to the piercing of
the resistance of: (a) moral defilements that are to be relinquished by [the path of]
vision and (b) undefiled nescience which has the meaning of the all-pervading as its
object; moreover, this is the path of vision. Its objective support is the objective
support for penetration. The ninth is [the objective support] for the
path of meditative development, up until the seventh spiritual level.
Diffusion refers to the state of existence of the most excellent culminating point and is
due to the practice of that same penetration of the dharmadhātu. It consists in the path
of meditative development, up until the seventh spiritual level. The objective support
for that path of meditative development is [equivalent to the objective support for
diffusion. The tenth is that for the mundane and supramundane paths
on that same [level] that it is the objective support for the latter is understood;
since [the bodhisattva] arrives at the understanding of the Dharma in its
various modes. It is an "understanding" (pragama) since, on that same spiritual
level, he attains the understanding (adhigama) of the Dharma in its various modes
(prakāra)375 by virtue of his freedom from the notional attachment to all376 the modes
etc. of the signs of the Dharma such as the Sūtras. The latter is described as the path of
meditative development on that same seventh spiritual level. The objective support that
pertains to understanding is the objective support for understanding. The
eleventh is [the objective support] on the eighth spiritual level; since, on
the eighth level, the meditative calm flows377 spontaneously on the part of [the
bodhisattva] whose mental attention is devoid of all signs and effort, that same path of
meditative development is described as meditative calm378. The objective support that
pertains to meditative calm is the objective support for meditative calm. The
twelfth is [the objective support] on the three spiritual levels beginning
with the ninth, because, on the ninth, he attains the culminating point of direct intu-
ition that consists in the analytical knowledges, on the tenth he attains the culminating
point of mastery over karma and on the Buddha level he attains the culminating point
of the purification of obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable, in
its entirety. In this way, because he reaches the culminating point of the purification of
both direct intuition and karma on the three spiritual levels beginning with the ninth, the
objective support of one who is established on those levels is described as the culmi-
nating objective support. However, others believe that the culminating objective
support is mentioned in regard to the three spiritual levels 379, after considering the
differentiation of the culminating point of the path as weak, middling and strong. And

those [original] first and second [objective supports] receive nominal
designations as the respective objective supports380 pertinent to each
state so extensive are the objective supports, namely381, the objective support for the
establishment of the dharmas and the dharmadhātu as objective support. In this
respect382, these two objective supports receive particular nominal designations in
relation to each state of direct intuition, (for example], the objective support for reten-
tion exists in the state of the knowledge that consists in learning because what is learnt
is the object of direct intuition consisting in retention, therefore383, retention knowledge
is described as retention. The same should be stated [for the other seven objective
supports] up until the culminating objective support. On the ninth, tenth and Buddha
levels, there is the culminating attainment, i.e. supramundane direct intuition and the
mundane [direct intuition] attained subsequently to that. Thus, the objective support
pertinent to this is the culminating objective support.
The supremacy of objective support has now been described.

4. Supremacy of Full Attainment.
Which are the full attainments?
V.29 abcdef
Those which consist in: (a) non-
defect, (b) non-rejection, (c) non-
distraction, (d) fulfilment, (e) gener-
ation, (f) development, (g) pliability,
(h) non-fixation, (i) non-obscuration
and (j) the full attainment of the
latter without interruption.
348
These are the ten kinds of full attainment. Of these, (a) the absence
of defects in causal conditions refers to full attainment in relation to the
spiritual lineage. (b) The non-rejection of the universal vehicle refers
to full attainment in relation to firm conviction. (c) The absence of
distraction away to the lesser vehicle refers to full attainment in relation
to the generation of the resolve [for enlightenment]. (d) The fulfilment
of the perfections refers to full attainment in relation to spiritual prac-
tice. (e) The generation of the noble path refers to full attainment in
relation to the entry into certainty. (f) The development of the roots of
the wholesome refers to full attainment in relation to the maturation of
sentient beings due to the prolonged exercise. (g) The pliability of
mind refers to full attainment in relation to the purification of the field.
(h) Non-fixation in samsāra or nirvana refers to full attainment in rela-
tion to the acquisition of the prophesies at the irreversible level because
[the bodhisattva] does not turn away from samsära or nirvana. (i) The
absence of obscuration refers to full attainment in relation to the
Buddha-level. (j) The non-interruption of the latter refers to full
attainment in relation to the complete exposition of enlightenment.
[Sthiramati]
Y255.2 [1] Now, in order to correctly determine the supremacy in relation to full attainment
whose appropriate place [for exposition] has arrived, he says: which are the full
attainments? They are full attainments insofar as they are brought about through
particular spiritual practices. They are described as supreme because: (a) they are super-
ior to other full attainments and (b) there are no other full attainments that are superior
to them. In order to demonstrate them, he says:Y256
Those which consist in: (a) non-
defect, (b) non-rejection³84, (c) non-
distraction, (d) fulfilment etc.
ment.
Therein, there are ten kinds of full attainment, beginning with the absence of
defects in causal conditions and concluding with the complete exposition of enlighten-
Of these, the absence of defects in causal conditions refers to full
attainment in relation to the spiritual lineage. The absence of defects in
causal conditions [means that] each of them is present; when these are secured [the
bodhisattva] attains the spiritual lineage in full what is meant is: the latter [i.e. the
spiritual lineage] becomes abundant and ever more excellent. Moreover, [these condi-
tions] refer to the mixing with good men, listening to the True Dharma and proper
mental attention etc. A defect in these is due to defects in relation to the spiritual
lineage and friends etc.385
V.29 ab
[2] The non-rejection of the universal vehicle refers to full attainment in
relation to firm conviction. If one does not reject the Dharma of the universal
vehicle which is characterized by profundity and magnanimity then the growth of firm
conviction which has the nature of the maintenance of [the bodhisattva's] determina-
tion, ensues.
349
-
[3] The absence of distraction away to the lesser vehicle refers to full
attainment in relation to the generation of the resolve [for enlighten-
ment]. Although the conditions may exist for a reversal of the resolve for enlighten-
ment on the part of one whose resolve for enlightenment has been generated, if³86 his
resolve does not stray to the śrävaka vehicle or to the pratyekabuddha vehicle, then his
resolve for enlightenment reaches maturity.
[4] The fulfilment of the perfections refers to full attainment in relation
to spiritual practice. On account of the fulfilment of the perfection of generosity
etc. there is growth in the accomplishment of omniscience on the part of those whose
resolve for enlightenment has been generated due to the force of the latter [i.e.
bodhicitta].

due to the generation of the noble path which has not [been generated] previously 388

Something faulty or in decay is described as 'raw' (ama) - where this is non-existent, it
is certain [lit. 'free from defect'] (nyāma), like a place sheltered from the wind389, i.e. a
region free from impurity. [The term]: 'entry into certainty' (nyāmävakrānti) is
[resolved as] entry into certainty (nyāmāyām avakrānti); what is meant is: the latter
[i.e. avakrānti, lit. 'descent'] is [equivalent to] 'entry' (praveśa)390. Also, as regards the
reading: 'entry into certainty' (niyamāvakrānti), the word 'certitude' (niyama) is none
other than certainty (niyama), for thus it is said that one for whom the path of vision
has arisen is certain [to be born] in a propitious state of existence or nirvana.
[6] The development of the roots of the wholesome refers to full attain-
ment in relation to the maturation of sentient beings due to the
prolonged exercise. The development of the roots of the wholesome refers to the
growth of the roots of the wholesome in those who have attained the path of vision due
to prolonged exercise or practice on the path of meditative development which is
attained subsequently to that [path of vision]. Since [the bodhisattva] has the ability to
bring beings to maturity on account of that [growth], consequently 391, the development
of the roots of the wholesome refers to full attainment in relation to the maturation of
beings. However, others believe that the maturation of sentient beings by [the
bodhisattva] in this way is fully attained because392 the roots of the wholesome are
strengthened393 in the mental continuum of sentient beings owing to prolonged practice
by him.
[7] The pliability of mind 394 refers to full attainment in relation to the
purification of the field 395. Since the pliability of mind on the part of those
whose roots of the wholesome have increased through meditative development is due
to separation from both the signs and the effort that are adverse to the path traversable
by just the one [i.e. the Buddha], he shows the Buddha-field [is attained], like crystal
etc. according to one's wish, through the influence of pliability 396. Hence, the pliability
of mind refers to full attainment in regard to the purification of the field. 397 Although
in a different Sūtra it is said: "One who wishes the pure Buddha-field should [first]
purify his own mind".

351
[8] Non-fixation in samsāra or nirvana refers to full attainment in rela-
tion to the acquisition of the prophesies at the irreversible level.
How
so? Hence he says: because [the bodhisattva] does not turn away from
samsāra or nirvana, because he is not fixed in samsāra or nirvana on account of
his mental pliability. Since he possesses the prosperous result of the three perfections
beginning with generosity, he is not fixed in nirvana due to his regard for sentient
beings. Since he possesses the three perfections beginning with vigour, he is not
defiled by the moral defilements of samsāra; therefore, he is not fixed in samsāra.
Alternatively, he is not fixed in samsāra nor nirvāṇa for he does not turn away from
either of them. In this respect, he does not turn away from samsāra because of his
regard for sentient beings for he accepts samsara out of compassion; nor does he turn
away from nirvāṇa on account of his wisdom. Thus, since the bodhisattva is fixed
neither in samsāra nor nirvana, he remains on the unshakable level which is irre-
versible, and [experiences] full attainment in relation to the acquisition of the prophesy
of his Buddha[hood]. Alternatively, [he experiences] full attainment in relation to both
the acquisition of the irreversible level and the acquisition of the prophesy.
[9] The absence of obscuration refers to full attainment in relation to the
Buddha-level398, because [the bodhisattva experiences] full attainment in relation to
the Buddha-level, which incorporates the three Bodies, on account of his relinquish-
ment of all obscuration that consists in moral defilement and the knowable together
with their latent impressions. Therefore, the absence of obscuration refers to full
attainment in relation to the Buddha-level.
[10] The non-interruption of the latter refers to full attainment in rela-
tion to the complete exposition of enlightenment. There is no interruption to
that Buddha's enlightenment due to the force of his universal compassion (which
endures] for as long as the world exists. Full attainment in relation to the complete
exposition of enlightenment is [equivalent to the demonstration of enlightenment. In
this regard, [the Buddha's] dwelling in the Tuşita realm, his descent into the womb, his
birth, his enjoyment of sense-pleasures, his departure from home, his performance of
difficult deeds, his turning of the Great Wheel of the Dharma and his mahäparinirvāṇa
etc. are demonstrated, because the complete exposition of enlightenment is not some-
thing separate from these [events]. The expression: "the complete exposition of enlight-
enment", includes [these] additional [events] also, since it is mentioned just as an
example.

The Explanation of the Name of the Treatise.
Thus, this is:
V.30 a
The treatise that consists in the
analysis of the middle;
V.30 C+
Because it elucidates the middle way. This is also the analysis of
the middle and the extremes because it elucidates the middle and the two
extremes. Alternatively, it [elucidates] the middle which is devoid of
beginning and end.
V.30 b
Its meaning is hidden
quintessential;
Because it is not the sphere of speculation nor can it be shattered by
those who hold other views, respectively.
V.30 c-
And it has universal meaning;
Because it is relevant to both oneself and to others.

It incorporates all meaning;

Because it is relevant to the three vehicles.

Because it brings about the relinquishment of both the obscuration

The
treatise that consists in the
analysis of the middle;
To provide the reason for engagement in the entry herein, he says: because it eluci-
dates the middle way; because this treatise herein elucidates the middle way devoid
of the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism. Therefore, this treatise is described
as the analysis of the middle what is meant is: it is an exposition and illustration of the
middle [way]. This is also the analysis of the middle and the extremes;
here now he provides the reason: because it elucidates the middle and the two
extremes, hence it is described as the analysis of the middle and the extremes. TheY259
353
middle, in this context, refers to the dharmadhatu which is without duality and the
extremes refer to imputation and negation. Alternatively, since it elucidates the
middle which is devoid of beginning and end, some believe this refers to
thusness; others believe that it is the imagination of the unreal which is without begin-
ning and end that is elucidated in this context and is referred to by the words 'middle
and extremes'.
V.30 b
meaning is hidden and
quintessential;
Its meaning is hidden because it is not the sphere of speculation and its
meaning is quintessential because it cannot be shattered by those who hold
other views, respectively. It is not the sphere of speculation because it is recog-
nized as the domain of direct intuition devoid of conceptual differentiation. meaning
is quintessential because it promulgates the meaning [of phenomena] as they are in
reality.

And it has universal meaning;
Because it is relevant to both oneself and to others; because it is relevant to
the bodhisattva's way of life, and because that way of life of the bodhisattva causes the
attainment of benefit for oneself and others.
V.30 +
It incorporates all meaning;
Because it is relevant to the three vehicles; since it illustrates the path of the
śrāvaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.

The Summary Meaning of the Supremacy of the
Vehicle.
354
The summary meaning of supremacy. Summarily, supremacy is
threefold: (a) spiritual practice, (b) the foundation of spiritual practice
and (c) the result of spiritual practice. Which kind of spiritual practice
is highest and in which way [is that practice performed]? "Mental
attention to the Dharma of the universal vehicle, as set forth etc." [V.7
ab], i.e. how and in which mode does it: (a) become free from distraction
through the meditative development of tranquillity and (b) become free
from erroneous inversion through the meditative development of pene-
trating insight? As to its purpose it is in order to go forth by the
middle way.
And it is in relation to what? "The specific and non-
specific are [to be known] in relation to the ten spiritual levels" [V.27
ab].
399
400
The summary meaning of the [various categories of] absence of
erroneous inversion: (a) [the bodhisattva] penetrates the sign of tran-
quillity and the sign of direct intuition399 through the absence of
erroneous inversion in relation to syllables. (b) He penetrates the sign
of erroneous inversion400 through the absence of erroneous inversion in
relation to objects. (c) He avoids the underlying cause of erroneous
inversion through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to
mental activity. (d) He firmly grasps the sign of the latter through the
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to non-dispersal.
(e) He
cultivates the path devoid of conceptual differentiation which [acts] as
the counteragent to the latter through the absence of erroneous inver-
sion in relation to the individual characteristic. (f) He penetrates that
which is pure by nature through the absence of erroneous inversion in
relation to the universal characteristic. (g) He understands in full the
relinquishment and non-relinquishment of obscuration to the latter
through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to impure and
pure mental activity. (h) He understands defilement and purification in
full, as they are in reality, through the absence of erroneous inversion
in relation to their adventitious nature. (i) He sets forth towards the

absence of obscuration through the absence of erroneous inversion in

Y261
The Madhyäntavibhaga is completed
[Sthiramati]
Y259.22 [1] The summary meaning of supremacy; the purpose for expressing the
summary meaning has been discussed previously. Summarily, supremacy is
threefold, although in detail it is infinite: (a) spiritual practice; he has stated that:
"supremacy is [considered] in relation to: spiritual practice..." [V.1 a]. (b) The
foundation of spiritual practice; he has stated that it is considered: "in relation
to objective support" [V.1 b-]. (c) The result of spiritual practice; he has stated
that: "it is considered as listed in relation to full attainment" [V.b+c].
Whatever virtue there is in writing this commentary,
May it be for the increase of merit and knowledge
for the great universe;
As the consequence of this, may the universe enjoy,
before long,
Great prosperity and the threefold enlightenment.
[2] Which kind of spiritual practice is highest? He has stated: "the highest
consists in twelve" [V.2 d]. And in which way [is that practice performed]?
"Mental attention to the Dharma of the universal vehicle, according to
its teaching, etc. is perpetual on the part of the bodhisattva, through the three modes
of wisdom" [V.7 abcd]; and similarly: "this [spiritual practice] is to be known as being
associated with the ten acts of the Dharma" [V.8 cd], i.e. how and in which mode
does it: (a) become free from distraction through the meditative devel-
opment of tranquillity due to the absence of the six kinds of distraction, and (b)
become free from erroneous inversion through the meditative develop-
ment of penetrating insight due to the absence of erroneous inversion in relation
to the ten [categories] beginning with syllables? As to its purpose it is in
order to go forth by the middle way; he has stated: "which is the spiritual
practice which incorporates the avoidance of the two extremes? [cf. Bhãşya N69.19]
And it is in relation to what? "In relation to the ten spiritual levels"
[V.27 b]. What is [the spiritual practice]? "The specific and non-specific"
[V.27 c]. How so? It was stated: "...are to be known in relation to the ten spiritual
leveis" [V.27 b].Y262
356
[3] The summary meaning of the [various categories of] absence of
erroneous inversion: (a) [the bodhisattva] penetrates 401 the sign of tran-
quillity and the sign of direct intuition402 through the absence of
erroneous inversion in relation to syllables; i.e. he comes to the realization
that a combination [of syllables] is devoid of essential nature. (b) He penetrates
the sign of erroneous inversion through the absence of erroneous inver-
sion in relation to objects; i.e. [he realizes] that the duality is just an appearance.
(c) He avoids the underlying cause of erroneous inversion403; i.e. the 'seed'
of the notional attachment to the duality which is deposited in the store-consciousness,
through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to mental activ-
ity.404
(d) He firmly grasps the sign of erroneous inversion owing to the
absence of the notional attachment to existent and non-existent [entities] which are like
magical creations, through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to
non-dispersal. (e) He cultivates the path devoid of conceptual differen-
tiation, which has the individual characteristic405 of the dharmas for its object and is
free from speech, which [acts] as the counteragent to the latter through the
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the individual character-
istic. (f) He penetrates that which is pure by nature, as being common to
all dharmas, through the absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the
universal characteristic. (g) He understands in full the relinquishment
and
non-relinquishment 406 of obscuration to the latter through the
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to impure and pure mental
activity, because the dharmadhatu which is luminous by nature is defiled by adven-
titious secondary defilement. (h) He understands defilement and purification
in full through the lack of erroneous inversion in relation to their
adventitious nature, because it is impossible that defilement and purification can
belong to what is luminous by nature, in any other way [i.e. other than as adventitious].
(i) He sets forth towards the absence of obscuration407 through the
absence of erroneous inversion in relation to the lack of fear and lack of
arrogance on account of the absence of the notional attachment to the personal entity
and the dharmas.
