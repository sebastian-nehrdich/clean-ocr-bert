MADHYÄNTAVIBHĀGA-BHÃṢYA-ȚIKĀ A Thesis submitted for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the Australian National University April, 1988 Richard StanleyThis thesis is the result of my own research carried out while enrolled as a Ph.D. candidate at the Australian National University 1984 1988.	0
Richard Star Richard StanleyDedication for Hannah and EllieABSTRACT	1
Sanskrit texts comprising the Buddhist Yogācāra philosophical work known as the Madhyāntavibhaga.	0
It includes the verses (kārikā) of Maitreya/Asanga, commentary (bhāşya) of Vasubandhu and sub-commentary (fika) of Sthiramati. (b) Text critical remarks for the establishment of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's commentary based upon: (i) a photographed copy of the original manuscript, (ii) the Edited Sanskrit text prepared by S.	0
Yamaguchi and (iii) the Peking and Derge (sde dge) editions of the canonical blockprints of the Tibetan bsTan hgyur.	0
The Madhyāntavibhāga contains an exposition of the analysis (vibhāga) of the middle way (madhya) in relation to the various extreme views (anta).	0
It is arranged in five chapters:	1
The first chapter, "the defining characteristics" (lakšaņa) provides a detailed account of both the nature of the phenomenal world and the way that it is imaginatively constructed (parikalpyate) in consciousness, as well as the Yogācāra understanding of emptiness (śünyata).	0
Chapter two identifies the main obscurations (avaraṇa) to enlightenment for the śravaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.	0
relationship with the three natures (svabhāva), i.e the imaginary (parikalpita), the other- dependent (paratantra) and the perfected (parinişpanna).	1
Chapter four is concerned with the development of meditative practices (bhāvanā), the various states (avasthā) of the latter and the results (phala) obtained from those states.	0
Chapter Five extols the virtues of the universal vehicle (mahāyāna) in comparison to the other vehicles especially in regard to spiritual practice (pratipatti), objective support (ālambana) and full attainment (samudāgama).ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS	0

Sthiramati Madhyāntavibhāgatīkā.३ Introduction There are three main reasons for this neglect: (a) The MAV- Tīkä stands virtually alone as a broad ranging account of early Yogãcãra thought; consequently it is often not possible to seek help from other parallel texts for a proper understanding of some of its more complex passages.	0
The Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra (MSA) is closely related to the MAV and a study of Sthiramati's commentary will undoubtedly shed more light on the MAV; however, the MSA reflects a more practice oriented doctrine and many of its ideas are generally at an earlier stage of development.	0
There are other shorter works in existence that obviously share common doctrinal elements with the MAV, such as the Dharmadharmatavibhāga and Vasubandhu's Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi; however, these works are relevant only to specific aspects of the early Yogācāra and	0
the philosophical thought of the Yogācāra school of Mahāyāna Buddhism at an early stage of its development.	0
As a systematic exposition of the Mahayana from the perspective of the early Yogācāra it is unique; thus its understanding is fundamental to a proper appreciation of Yogācāra thought.	0
In the Indian Yogacara tradition the MAV comprises three essential works: (a) the Kārikā text attributed to Maitreya / Asanga, (b) Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya and (c) the Țīkā of Sthiramati.	0
Considering that all three of these works have been available for more than fifty years it is remarkable that they have not been comprehensively studied to- date.	1
The French translation and annotation of the Vijñaptimātratāsiddhi by Louis de La Vallée Poussin in 1928-292 remains the most authoritative study of the Yogācāra- vijñaptimātra doctrine.	0
However, this work is not representative of the Yogācāra as a whole but is heavily influenced by Dharmapala's interpretation of the thought of Maitreya and Vasubandhu and has fundamental differences from Sthiramati's interpretations as contained in the MAV-Tīka³.	0
Apart from a flurry of scholarly activity that coincided with the publication of the Sanskrit Editions of Sthiramati's Tika in the early 1930's and Vasubandhu's Bhaṣya5 in the 1960's, the MAV has received only piecemeal attention.	0

this school lies in the fact that the precise meaning of many of the words and concepts employed by Sthiramati is often of quite an enigmatic nature.	0
This is due partly to his terse commentarial style but also because the reader's familiarity with many of the subjects discussed is assumed and no attempt is made at further clarification.	0
In addition, when presenting the alternative views held by other schools Sthiramati never identifies the particular school intended; presumably because this is also assumed to be common knowledge. (c) The third factor that has had an inhibiting influence on the study of the MAV is the quality of the Sanskrit text of Sthiramati's Tīkä edited and published by S.	0
Yamaguchi.	0
The manuscript used by Yamaguchi was hand-copied from a badly damaged original, a large portion of which was reconstructed with the help of the Tibetan translations.	0
Since it is often impossible to recast much more than the known technical terms from the Tibetan into Sanskrit with any certainty, such an enterprise is never entirely satisfactory and this edition stands in need of improvement.	0
It was the French scholar Sylvain Lévi who first discovered the Sanskrit manuscript of the MAV-Tīka in Nepal in 1928 and arranged to have a copy prepared by hand.	0
Inevitably scribal errors were incorporated during the copying process.	0
As mentioned above, the original manuscript was incomplete with approximately one third of all the folios missing on the left-hand side.	0
The copied manuscript was then entrusted to Susumu Yamaguchi who prepared a Sanskrit edition, the first two chapters of which were published over the next couple of years in various issues of Otani Gakuhō6.	0
Meanwhile, the MAV-Țikã was discovered for a second time in Nepal by Guiseppe Tucci, who, with the help of Vidhusekhara Bhaṭṭācārya, also	0
and reconstruct the missing portions of the entire text, they eventually published only the first chapter in 19327.	0
This is a work of good quality (in devanagarī script) and the reconstructed sentences are sometimes preferable to those of Yamaguchi's edition.	0
In 1934 S.	0
Yamaguchi published an edition of the complete Sanskrit text in five chapters (in Romanised form) which includes the portions recast from the Tibetan.	0
Although this edition of the MAV-ȚIka has many shortcomings, it must be regarded as a significant and valuable scholarly achievement; this edition is used as the basis of the present study.	0
pp.59-99.	0
This work was reviewed by E.	0
Obermiller in IHQ, Vol.	0
IX, 1933, (pp.1019-1030) where he suggests some valuable alternative readings, especially in the reconstructed portions.	0
The MAV-Bhäşya then became the focus of scholarly attention with the publication in 1937 of S.	0
Yamaguchi's edition of Vasubandhu's Bhasya which included the Tibetan translation and the Chinese translations of Hsüan-tsang and Paramärtha¹3.	0
In 1953-54 P.W.	0
O'Brien published an English translation of the third chapter of the Bhāṣya in two issues of Monumenta Nipponica¹4.	0
This is a very thorough and readable work based on the Tibetan and Chinese translations and includes abundant references to Sthiramati's Tika (Yamaguchi's ed.) and also to the LVP Kośa and Siddhi.	0
An important contribution to the study of the MAV was made in 1964 when Gadjin M.	0
Nagao published a Sanskrit (Romanised) edition of Vasubandhu's Bhāṣya which incorporates the Karikā text¹5.	0
It was epared from a manuscript discovered in the Ngor Monastery in Tibet by Rahula Sanskrityāyana in 1934 and is an exceptionally fine work requiring only a few minor corrections.	0
The publication of this edition now made it possible to revise Yamaguchi's edition of the Tīkä since the latter contains many quotations from the Bhäsya that were reconstructed	0

Stcherbatsky published an English translation of just the first chapter of the MA V- Tika.	0
This work which includes a translation of Vasubandhu's Bhãşya from the Tibetan is based on the Tucci and Bhaṭṭācārya edition of the Tika as well as the Tibetan translation.	0
As far as the translation is concerned, it is not a very useful work since it suffers both from Stcherbatsky's somewhat florid and free style as well his many philosophical misconceptions regarding the Yogacara doctrine.	0
However, his text- critical remarks and annotations where he often provides a more literal translation are quite valuable; many are difficult to improve upon and are incorporated in the present study.	0
At the same time that Stcherbatsky was preparing his translation, the Dutch scholar David Friedmann was also translating the first chapter of the Tikå based on Yamaguchi's edition.	0
When he discovered that the Russian scholar was translating the same work, Friedmann almost abandoned his translation but fortunately was persuaded by Stcherbatsky himself to complete his study¹2.	0
The result is a good translation, generally superior to that of Stcherbatsky's and well annotated particularly through its references to the LVP Kośa and Siddhi; however, no attempt has been made to rectify the Sanskrit textual problems.	0

Nagao also published a Japanese translation of chapters I and III of the Bhāṣya¹6 and a translation of the whole Bhāṣya in 1976?17 Another edition of the Sanskrit Bhäşya was published in 1967 by Nathmal Tatia and Anantalal Thakur ¹8.	0
An attempt was made to improve upon Yamaguchi's edition of the Tīkā by the Indian scholar Ramachandra Pandeya who published a revised edition in 197119 incorporating the Bhãşya and Kärikā text.	0
In the introduction to this work Pandeya claims that his corrections to Yamaguchi's edition are made on the basis of the Tibetan translation (Peking Ed.).	0
Pandeya's edition was reviewed by J.W. de Jong20 who demonstrated that in many instances his emendations appear to be made quite arbitrarily without recourse to the Tibetan text and for this reason Pandeya's edition has not been consulted in the present study.	0
In his review, de Jong resolves many of the textual problems of the second chapter of the Țikä.	0
In 1982 Thomas A.	0
Kochumuttom published a study of the essential doctrines from the works of Vasubandhu21 which includes an English translation of the first chapter of the MAV-Bhāṣya as well as selected parts of the Tika.	0
Although his translation of the Bhãṣya is generally quite accurate, his translation of the Țika passages (upon which much of his interpretative comment depends) is based on Pandeya's edition which, as we have seen, is not completely reliable.	0
It should be noted that Kochumuttom's understanding of the philosophy of Vasubandhu is controversial for he argues that it is open to interpretation as a system that embraces "realistic pluralism".	0
An English translation of the whole MAV-Bhāṣya was included in a publication by Stephan Anacker in 198422.	0

Several months after beginning my study I was fortunate enough to discuss my research with Professor M.	1
Hahn of the Indologisches Seminar of the University of Bonn who was visiting the A.N.U. at the time.	0
Following his suggestion I contacted the Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project in Kathmandu, Nepal, on the chance that the original manuscript of the MAV-Tīkā were listed among their records.	0
As it turned out, this was in fact the case the Tīkä had indeed been discovered for a third time and was catalogued and microfilmed in 1970 by that organization.	0
Many months later I managed to secure a copy of the manuscript which was photographed from the microfilmed copy.	0
The script of the manuscript is clearly a variety of Nevari and the reproduction is generally of a very high quality, most characters being quite legible as can be seen from the samples shown in Appendix I.	0
It soon became obvious that it was the very manuscript found by Lévi and Tucci more than fifty years earlier although a little worse for wear.	0
When compared with Yamaguchi's edition, the lacunae coincide almost exactly; the only differences being caused by further deterioration along the damaged side of some folios where up to ten characters may be lost.	0
The first folio (1b) is in a particularly bad state with only a small fragment that can be read with certainty.	0
Also, two folios are completely absent (31b and 32a equivalent to Y105.15 to 106.27).	0
The microfilm is kept in the National Archives, Kathmandu, Nepal, and the details found on the title page are as follows:	0

The re-discovery of the original manuscript of the MAV-Țīkâ has thus made it possible to include new material in this study, material that is particularly relevant to the establishment of the Sanskrit text.	0
By comparing the original manuscript with the Yamaguchi edition it has been possible to detect and rectify many mis-readings and scribal errors that were incorporated into the Yamaguchi edition.	0
This aspect of my work has been further complemented through the acquisition of a photo-copy of the actual manuscript used by Yamaguchi which was kindly supplied by Prof.	0

As my research progressed it became apparent that there would not be time to carry out the third component originally envisaged, i.e. the exegesis of the text; rather, the completed study would be restricted to the translation and textual emendations.	0
In addition to the textual problems encountered in the Sanskrit Tīkā, the Tibetan translation is also quite corrupt in many places, thus compounding the difficulties in establishing the Sanskrit.	0
Although I am now reasonably satisfied that the majority of the textual problems have been resolved, the completed work cannot not be regarded as1. definitive or conclusive.	0
The MAV-Tīkā will no doubt yield greater coherence to future scholars and many of its more enigmatic passages will be translated with more certainty only after the writings of Sthiramati are understood in greater depth.	0
Suffice it to say that, although there is considerable scope for improvement through future research, is intended that this study may serve as the basis for a critical edition of the Sanskrit text of the Tika and that the translation will be of value to those seeking a proper understanding of the philosophy and doctrine of the early Yogācāra.	0

As its title suggests, the central theme of the Madhyāntavibhāga is the analysis (vibhāga) of the traditional Buddhist concept of the Middle Way (madhya) in relation to the various extreme views (anta) recast to accomodate the spiritual perspective of the Yogācāra.	0
The extremes are normally identified as belonging to two essential categories, i.e. as the extreme views which lead to imputation (samāropa) or negationxviii (apavāda) in regard to the existence (bhava) of phenomena in contrast to the way that they are to be understood in reality.	0
The MAV is arranged in five chapters which deal with seven main subjects: (a) the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa), (b) the obscurations (āvaraṇa), (c) the realities (tattva), (d) the meditative development of counteragents (pratipakṣa-bhāvanā), (e) the various states (avasthā) in the latter, (f) the attainment of results (phala-präpti) and (g) the supremacy of the [universal] vehicle (yānānuttarya).	0
Each chapter concludes with an abridged summary (piņdārtha) of contents which, according to Sthiramati24, is included to enable the student to easily remember both the contents and sequential order of the subjects explained.	0
The first chapter, which is possibly the most complex of the five, provides a detailed account of the essential philosophy of this school.	0
The chapter is divided into two parts: the defining characteristics (lakṣaṇa) of: (a) the imagination of what is unreal (abhūta-parikalpa) and (b) emptiness (śūnyatā).	0
Part (a) explores both the nature of the phenomenal world which is understood in essence as unreal (abhūta), and the way in which it comes into being or is imaginatively constructed (parikalpa).	0
This part is divided into nine sections which include explanations of the three natures (tri- svabhāva), the dynamics of the actualizing consciousnesses (pravṛtti-vijñānāni) and an extremely detailed re-interpretation of the theory of dependent origination (pratitya- samutpāda) according to this school.	0
Part (b) defines the correct understanding of emptiness (śūnyată) in the context of Yogacara thought.	0
This includes a sixteenfold differentiation of emptiness and contains some of the more enigmatic portions of the text particularly where emptiness is described as having some sort of positive ontological value, i.e. the characteristic of emptiness is defined as the existence of a	0
constantly re-stated significance of the imminent relationship between the conventional understanding of phenomena (dharma) and their real nature (dharmata).	0
The second chapter has a more practical orientation than the first insofar as it examines the main obscurations (āvaraṇa) to enlightenment (bodhi).	0
These are reduced to two broad categories, namely, the obscuration that consists in moral defilement and that which consists in the knowable (kleśa-jñeya-āvaraṇa).	1
Firstly, it identifies obscuration that is common to the śrävaka, the pratyekabuddha and the bodhisattva.	0
It then concentrates specifically on the bodhisattva by defining the obscurations to his attainment of (a) the factors that contribute to enlightenment (bodhi-pakṣya), (b) the perfections (pāramitā) and (c) the spiritual levels (bhūmi).	0
The third chapter provides an explanation of the ten realities (tattva).	0
These are identified as the ten main areas where one's understanding of phenomena as they are in reality (yatha-bhūta) is susceptible to confusion especially in regard to erroneous inversion (viparyāsa), imputation and negation.	0
Fundamental to the ten realities are the	1
